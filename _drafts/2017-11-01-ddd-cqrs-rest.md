### DDD (Domain-Driven Design)

[In my previous architecture post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-10-26-thinking-about-architecture %}), I discussed different aspects of small- to medium-sized application architecture and the components therein. I hammered home the importance of keeping your application small initially, and only growing out the architecure as needed. The world would be a better place if developers and engineers with too much time would stop over-architecting their code for the sake of premature optimization.
