<b>Hooptober X | 11/34 | Robert Englund

<b>Freddy on a skateboard, I know, I know it's serious</b>

<i>— Do unborn babies dream?</i>

Alice dreams of hot sex with her boyfriend, Dan, and then takes a hot shower. But wait! The shower head attacks her and forces her into an asylum, where she takes on the role of Amanda, Freddy's mother

Cut to graduation, and we meet the new gang. Alice's world keeps bleeding into the same nightmare — now, she witnesses someone give birth to a hilarious demon baby that inflates to Freddy Krueger

Alice finds out that she's pregnant and that Freddy is accessing her through her baby's dreams and once again killing off her friends. Her baby manifests in her dreams as a little boy named Jacob, but Jacob is becoming friends with Freddy

<b>Special Effects That Stood Out</b>
* Freddy turns into a motorcycle and injects wires into someone's face
* The amazing baby Freddy
* The fridge fills with mold and eyeballs
* MC Escher stairs
* Pulling Freddy out of their face
* Whatever the hell is going on in the finale

<b>Special Effects That Were Dumb as Hell</b>
* Putting someone in a high chair and force-feeding them to death
* A diving board turns into Freddy's claws
* Turning someone into a paper drawing, draining the color from them, and then ripping them up — by far the worst death in any of the movies

This movie was still easy to watch, even if it made the least sense of any of them — out-of-sequence and missing shots make the plot borderline incomprehensible

But this one is way worse than the others, so I'm dreading <i>Freddy's Dead
</i>
