David starts at a new school where bullies control everyone, and one of his best friends is in the bully group. He is initially content to assist others (particularly when the bullies corner and try to rape two girls), but when they crush his leg under a car and permanently cripple him, David escalates

The film takes an uncommon approach to the revenge flick in that it shows what happens when the old bullies are gone and how new bullies emerge, suggesting that as long as there is a power imbalance, some will want to subjugate others to their will

This movie influenced <i>Heathers</i>, and their third acts are both remarkably similar. <i>Heathers</i>, however, goes for a black humor that this movie could not pull off. That said, the absurdity of the revenge taken gets so over-the-top that it becomes funny — so many explosions!

Also, what an opening — cold open to an explosion followed by the goofiest 70s ballad — footage of kids fucking and fighting intercut with David jogging on the beach

I enjoyed this more than I thought I would. It's not as clever as it thinks it is, but it's never dull
