**Rating:** 2/5

Two small children (4 and 6) murder their parents and go to a mental institution. Their older sister Ellen, who witnessed it all, goes into foster care

Years later, Ellen is a live-in secretary engaged to her boss' son. With her uncle's passing, Ellen is now the next relative in line to take custody of her younger siblings, who are now teenagers

Ellen forces her siblings into secrecy about their past. The siblings request a "mad room" in which to process their emotions, and Ellen offers them a room she has no right offering

This movie is pretty uninspired, and the outcome is predictable the second you see it coming in the first act. The film is a made-for-TV product, and artlessly so, so there's no appeal beyond the story

The performances aren't bad except for the actor portraying Ellen, who is in a whole other world

That said, being boring does not mean terrible, and it's glued together decently. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, though
