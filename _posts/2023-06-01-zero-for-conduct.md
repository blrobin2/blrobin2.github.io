Kid rebellion in a boarding school, aided in part by Supervisor Huguet (Jean Dasté), expressed in rioting, trashing classrooms and bedrooms, and several feats of magic — the world made in the kids’ vision

I’ve never seen anything like this, it never broadcasts when it’s going to do surreal stuff, it just jumps out of kids playing to impossibilities

It’s so funny that the French Ministry of the Interior considered portraying rebellious kids onscreen as a threat to the maintenance of order

Kind of chaotic and difficult to follow at points, but still an amazing experience
