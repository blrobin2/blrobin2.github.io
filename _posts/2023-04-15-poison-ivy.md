**Rating:** 2.5/5

Drew Barrymore is doing the perfunctory “adult” movie that child actors do to prove that they’re “not a kid anymore” or something

Jennifer’s Body-type relationship between Drew Barrymore and Sara Gilbert — the dangerous object of desire and the observer

It sucks when you bond with another outsider only for them to try and fuck your dad — or, more specifically, try to replace your mom

I think there’s something genuine at the core of this movie — the mother-daughter relationship has specifics and color that the rest of the movie lacks. Drew Barrymore’s character could have a more nuanced take with a different actor
