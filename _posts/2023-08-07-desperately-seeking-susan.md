**Rating:** 4/5

<blockquote><i>Desperate. I love that word — it's so romantic.</i></blockquote>Roberta is married and unhappy with her life, following the exploits of Susan and Jim in their want ad romance, whose title is always "Desperately Seeking Susan." She decides to go to their meeting place and follow Susan, getting to know her mannerisms and style. 

When Susan sells a jacket, Roberta buys it, finding a key inside. Roberta puts a "Desperately Seeking Susan" ad in the paper for Susan to meet her for the key, wearing the jacket and a blonde wig

Yada yada yada Roberta hits her head and forgets who she is. Because she's dressed like Susan, an acquaintance of Jim thinks she is Susan. Roberta goes along with it, not remembering anything

Rosanna Arquette is so good in this — I haven't seen her in a lead role before, and that's a shame! Madonna does well, I think because she's playing a version of herself

Great screwball comedy of errors, like a great episode of <i>Fraiser</i> — tight script, so many great jokes, and the third act is so satisfying

I love it!

<b>stray thoughts</b>
* Rosanna Arquette and Susan Seidelman look like sisters 
* Laurie Metcalf!
* Cat licking the aquarium, so cute
* Coffee shop playing "Someday, Someway" by Marshall Crenshaw — I love that song
* Woah, the reunited triplets from the Three Identical Strangers documentary have a cameo!
* Rum and Tab, I wish I could order that
