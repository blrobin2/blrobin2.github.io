<blockquote><i>Do you remember those boyhood days when going to College was greater than going to Congress — and you'd rather be Right Tackle than President?</i></blockquote>

Nope!

Harold Lamb (Haroly Lloyd) is off to Tate University. He saved up by selling washing machines — a real go-getter. It hurt my brain to see the dates in his ledger say '24.

Harold reads a book of "college yells" to practice for football games. The interstitials are dynamic and electric — lightning bolds coming off the words. He attempts to copy what he learned from the movie <i>The College Hero</i>. He dresses just like the main character, Speedy, and does a jig whenever he greets anyone.

Of course, when he tries it out, other boys simply greet people, so he can't find a way in edge-wise. Also, older schoolmates see an easy mark and give him the runaround.

He meets the adoring Peggy (Jobyna Ralston), who knows that he's the butt of everyone's jokes but can't bring herself to burst his bubble. She defends his character and "spunk" when no one else will. The two actors have legit chemistry, so it makes sense they made seven movies together.

Lamb learns that if he wants to be the college hero, he needs to be on the football team. Despite appearing foolish initially, he taps into his unique abilities with Peggy's guidance.

Harold Lloyd may be the most idealist of the Big Three silent movie comedians, but he is also the most aware of the role that movies and media play on themselves.

This film is full of meta references to popular culture of the time. Harold Lloyd understood how we define ourselves by the stories we consume, including referencing Frank Merriwell, an obnoxious hero character who excelled at everything he did, all while maintaining humility. Sound familiar?

I also think Lloyd's style of humor has aged the best. The through-line from him to an Andy Sandberg type is clear — an idealist who makes a fool of himself, but when he finds himself, he inadvertently becomes the hero he wishes to emulate.

Of course, there is incredible physical humor.

The interstitial character introductions are all pretty funny, but my favorite might be, "The coach — so tough, he shaves with a blowtorch."

The scene with Lloyd trying to save the cat and hiding the kitten under his sweater is adorable.

The updated soundtrack is perfect. It's contemporary and fits every scene.

Charlie Chaplin is iconic, Buster Keaton is impressive, but Harold Lloyd is funny.
