**Rating:** 2/5

Lot of wordy jokes in this one. Their Rondo Hatton jokes are so fucking cruel.

* Et tu, brute man?
* If this were a planet where apes evolved from men, this is probably how we'd get into our house
* I'm not a burglar, I'm a hot dog
* Oh this is so legal
* god is dead? good!
* Oh look, he puts applesauce in his meat loaf
* So tell me about this cat poster. It has a cat hanging from a stick?
* Mr. Moffet, sit on my tuffet
* I've never had to spank a senior until now
* I wonder what the odds are that I live here?
* So this is a Persian rug
* Hal, you're hurt. I hear blood
