Lot of wordy jokes in this one. Their Rondo Hatton jokes are so fucking cruel.

- Et tu, brute man?
- If this were a planet where apes evolved from men, this is probably how we'd get into our house
- I'm not a burglar, I'm a hot dog
- Oh this is so legal
- god is dead? good!
- Oh look, he puts applesauce in his meat loaf
- So tell me about this cat poster. It has a cat hanging from a stick?
- Mr. Moffet, sit on my tuffet
- I've never had to spank a senior until now
- I wonder what the odds are that I live here?
- So this is a Persian rug
- Hal, you're hurt. I hear blood
