<blockquote><i>— I don't know. It's always as if I'm going to die tomorrow. Something inside me pushes me to do silly things.
— What if you were in love? Would that make a difference?
— Maybe.</i></blockquote><b>Saint-Tropez, France</b>
A white Lancia Aurelia pulls up to the gate. Eric Carradine, in a dapper suit, steps out. He walks around back to where the laundry hangs drying. There, behind a white sheet, lay Juliette, nude, only her feet visible. Eric has brought Eve an apple — a red Simca convertible toy. He promises her the real thing if he can have her.

Juliette's adopted mother finds her and Eric, and chastises her for "being a slut." Her mother intends to put her back up for adoption if she doesn't change her ways.

Eric is working on a project to build a casino in Saint-Tropez. He has the capital and location, but the Tardieu shipyard is in the way. Antoine, the eldest Tardieu brother, does not want to sell.

Antoine is another of Juliette's suitors and the one that she loves. With him in town, she expects him to propose and take her away. But in the bathroom, she overhears Antoine brag about his intention to hook up with Juliette and leave her.

Michel, Antoine's younger brother, has developed an infatuation with Juliette. Eric sees a way to get what he wants.

Though Brigette Bardot had acted in a dozen or more movies prior, including one directed by Vadim, this film launched Brigette Bardot into international stardom, especially in the US. Why? Because this film is where she becomes the "sex kitten," who drives all men mad by being hot.

Bardot is a tremendous force, but that isn't enough to sustain the movie. No one else is likable — they all have ulterior motives and selfish whims. Only Juliette is pure of heart, never wishing to lead anyone astray or do them wrong. She does, but only because of unbearable temptation.

Still, the film is decent, and its success makes sense.
