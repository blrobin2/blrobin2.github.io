**Rating:** 3.5/5

The scene with Jeanne Crain playing the piano is so beautifully staged with the open window and the flowers

I didn’t recognize Vincent Price when he came onscreen, I guess it’s the lack of his signature disgusting mustache?

I honestly get her annoyance with Danny coming along, but I would just be distant and passive-agressive about it instead of… what she does. I would audibly complain if they invited my family up to surprise me, though, how oblivious can you be?

This is “anxious attachment” logic taken to its conclusion
