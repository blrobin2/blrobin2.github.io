**Rating:** 3.5/5

<i>Le Million</i> walked so that <i>Rat Race</i> could run

Definitely a film I appreciated more than enjoyed, but it has some moments — the rooftop sets are great, the way it folds together music, dialogue and sound effects is impressive for the time, and the opera performance scene in particular is a standout
