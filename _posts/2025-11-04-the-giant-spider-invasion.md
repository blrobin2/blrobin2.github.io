<b>The 30th live RiffTrax episode</b>

This movie is basically the plot of <i>Men in Black</i>, but here the inciting incident takes up the first hour.

- Hi, little buddy? Mind if I call you Gilligan? No reason!
- Meanwhile, an unknown woman in an unknown place does something unknown.
- Hi, it's God calling. Please stop all of this!
- I'm gonna lose a finger today if it's the last thing I do.
- _krrrk_ The wages of sin is death. Over. _krrk_
- Rise, dirt witch, rise!
- That dang black hole's gotta be around here somewhere.
- Sees a normal-sized spider, and he crashes into the only building for miles.
- We're dangerously close to being involved in the plot.
