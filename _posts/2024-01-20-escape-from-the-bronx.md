**Rating:** 2/5

As a title, <i>Escape from the Bronx</i> blows compared to <i>Escape 2000</i>

This movie rules at times and is intensely dull at others. I wish sick explosions and funny shooting faces were enough for me.

This episode is the last one with a fan letter :(

* I'm a pretty good judge of who's going to leave the Bronx, and this guy isn't one of them
* Sir, would you at least take a Watchtower?
* Have you seen a knife like this? But wait, there's more!
* A fascist Italian? Come on...
* Is that true? Do you suck?
* Abandon all buildings ye who enter here
* You! Lick me!
* War-torn The Bronx
* Another hard-hitting look at cities with buildings
* This is good gum!
* I think I have something, over. I think it's a cold, over.
* Oh bummer! I hope they don't blow our crotches up
* Hi, kill us! Thank you!
