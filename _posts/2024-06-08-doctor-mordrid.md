**Rating:** 3/5

Another Emily episode! I'm warming to her — it's always an adjustment with new hosts. Speaking of new hosts, Dr. Kabal demands a third host, this time forcing Kinga and Max to go through The Time Bag and recover... Joel!

I watched this episode on PlutoTV when I first realized there were new <i>MST3K</i> episodes. I'm amazed at how Charles Band got away with not only blatantly ripping off Doctor Strange, but claiming the film is based on his original idea. Jeffrey Combs makes everything he's in better — he pronounces stipend "shtipend." Also, that one guy from The X-Files!


* You have the right to remain driving!
* Materialis! Lorem ipsum!
* Is he trying to break into that map?
* I guess it's a table for one at Chuck E. Cheese
* I'm powerful too. Now you say it.
* Oh no, it's a farce
* One does not simply walk into Mordrid's
* — These volumes are amazing! — THANKS, I LIKE LOUD THE BEST!
* — That's Edgar Allen — The furniture guy?
* Oh my god, even his stomach is a door
* Feel the wrath of 52-card pickup
* What is that? A smooching rock?
* Time for a nice hot cup of pasta sauce
* Body search mandatory? I assume they wouldn't be voluntary
* New stepdad alert!
