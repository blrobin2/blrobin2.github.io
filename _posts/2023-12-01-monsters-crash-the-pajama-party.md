<blockquote><i>— Igor likes sex!
</i><i>— Yeah, we know.</i></blockquote>A guy with a robe labeled "Mad Doctor" warns the audience about shadows.
A narrator reads the credits out loud while a guy in a gorilla costume tries to figure out different filmmaking equipment. These credits take up about 1/5 of the runtime.

Teens spend the night in a haunted house for sorority initiation.

The rumor is that Mad Doctor owns the house. Also, he turns teenagers into monster henchmen.

The boys who brought them decide to get monster masks to scare the initiates.

The girls all get in their nighties and put on some doo-wop.

Meanwhile, a totally real gorilla henchman snatches a girl looking for a bathroom. The Mad Doctor accidentally makes her into a much bigger gorilla.

After that, the continuity gets confusing.

The movie is supposed to be funny — cue [wonky instrumental music]. I laughed at a few jokes — a "cut here" tattoo on Sue's forehead, an Erlenmeyer flask labeled "empty bottle."

They made the movie to be played in front of a crowd, as there's some audience interaction and a scene where the henchmen run offscreen and abduct an audience member.

It's a cheap oddity that doesn't do anything particularly well.
