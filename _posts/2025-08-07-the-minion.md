Woo doggy, this script is amazingly clunky. The film has a fun premise, but the structure and dialogue are messy.

I appreciate that the archaeologist brought reference books — it's not exciting to watch, but it's more believable than recognizing every symbol and artifact on sight. Too bad literally every other person has this power.

TECHNICALLY, this is a Christmas movie.

* These are minions? They don't look anything like those memes my aunt sends me.
* Bones? Skull? Yep, it's a skeleton alright.
* He's not Celtic, he's a Celtics fan.
* Who said that? Who were they talking to? Who were they talking about?
* Aaand I instantly regret kissing the ancient sewer key.
* I guess Dolph gave him second-to-last rites.
* God's other son, Chad of Nazareth.
* A guy on a prison toilet could be the Minion.
* You're the Cleveland Browns of evil!
* — Don't tempt me, demon! — That's what I say when the waiter brings the dessert menu.
* I'm a carving of Terry O'Quinn now.
