**Rating:** 3/5

Paul Matthews is a tenured professor in biology. He has a lovely wife and two daughters, all of whom find him perfectly fine. 

Also, he's showing up in people's dreams. 

It starts with a couple of people, but as word spreads, so does his presence in dreams.

To Paul's dismay, every dream involves something terrible happening while he walks by, unbothered and unhelpful.

Still, as his celebrity increases, he pushes for an opportunity to publish his book. If only he would get around to it.

Not everyone's dreams are the same, though. Paul meets a woman who has intense sex dreams about him.

How he handles this may change everything. Whether it is for better or worse depends on him.

On paper, this is a great movie. In practice, it is a mixed bag. The first act is sharp and hilarious. The second act is tedious and predictable. The third somewhat makes it up with a solid finale.

Nic Cage is perfect, though I would have liked to see  Adam Sandler, who was supposed to play the part.

I'm always happy to see Michael Cera and adore seeing Kate Berlant in anything, but neither gets much to do.

Another pass or two on the script, and this might have been something worth seeing. As it stands, it's good, but only that.
