<b><a href="https://boxd.it/OPp3M/detail" target="_blanK" rel="noopener">Hooptober XII | 27/31 | The Wizard of Oz</a></b>

It's <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>. No synopsis needed. That said, it's been since childhood since I've watched this movie in full, and even then, I would zone out until "Somewhere Over the Rainbow". So, seeing the first act in full, I realize just how much foreshadowing it contains.

It's sort of impossible to evaluate this movie. It's as iconic as movies come. Its music and imagery have been a part of my mental references for as long as I can remember. Lines of dialogue feel like choruses to songs I know.

Here's what I can say. I think the story is perfectly structuredâ€”it reads like a classic fable. When the color kicks in, the moment is still as wonderful and lush as I remember. Some of the set pieces are actual magic tricks, adding a degree of awe to the spectacle. If a family film is one that everyone can watch and enjoy, then this movie remains the greatest family film ever made.

Since I'm watching this for Hooptober, I will list some things that freaked me out as a kid:

- The rear projection used during the tornado, and especially Almira Gulch's transformation into the Wicked Witch of the West.
- When the ruby slippers disappear from the Wicked Witch of the East and her feet curl in.
- The reddish-orange smoke that the Wicked Witch of the West disappears into.
- The apple trees when they start throwing apples.
- The Cowardly Lion's face.
- The red sand that counts down Dorothy's life.
- The Wicked Witch of the West's death.

#### Stray Thoughts

- I adore Margaret Hamilton!
- Judy Garland is perfect. I keep hearing how much her and Liza Minnelli's voices sound alike.
- I wish W.C. Fields had played the Wizard like they planned. That said, Frank Morgan's good enough at the comedic beats.
- The near-silent build-up after the house crashes down gives me chills.
- If they ever made a theme park that perfectly captures the sets, I would love, love, love to experience this world firsthand.
- Billie Burke's entrance in the bright pink bubble is so iconic. I get why David Lynch had to recreate it in <i>Wild at Heart</i>.
- It's so wild that they throw a parade for the Wicked Witch's death. Dorothy seems fine, considering she just committed involuntary manslaughter.
- "People come and go so quickly here!"
- "Of course, people do go both ways." Thank you, bisexual icon, Scarecrow.
- The poppy scene just looks so gorgeous.
- The Oz graphic t-shirts!
- I hate The Cowardly Lion's song "If I Were King of the Forest."
- The Wicked Witch's castle matte painting feels like Looney Tunes (compliment).
- Oooh, the Night on Bald Mountain motif when they're rescuing Dorothy!
- "Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain!"
- The only acceptable "It was all a dream" ending.
