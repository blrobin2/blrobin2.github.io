Janet and her visibly gay boyfriend, Brad, watch two friends get married. He does what he’s supposed to do and proposes to her.

They drive off in a storm on their honeymoon. They hit an inexplicable dead end, get a flat tire, and walk to the castle they passed.

A pale, balding man answers the door, reluctantly letting them in. Then they do the <i>Time Warp</i>, the one song I know from this.

Then Frank N Furter shows up, the transexual transvestite from Transylvania. The guests strip down Janet and Brad and invite them up to Frank’s laboratory, where he shows off his invention, Rocky.

Then all hell breaks loose.

Yes, this is my first time watching it. Unfortunately, it’s on a computer screen.

It would require a crowd for me to get into this type of musical — a musical where no one sings or dances well, and the songs suck — a musical where the <em>SPIRIT</em> makes it enjoyable. Another way of putting it is that I should’ve seen this at a younger age if I was to get more out of it.
