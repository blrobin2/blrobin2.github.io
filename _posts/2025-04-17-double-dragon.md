**Rating:** 2/5

* — You're dead, losers! — I yell that every time I pass a graveyard.
* Andy Dick? They didn't want to leave out the demographic that pounds adderall and robs pharmacies.
* None of this is in the game!
* — The Power Corp. are terrorists! — Dad, you said the same thing about the Animaniacs.
