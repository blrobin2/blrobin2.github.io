We open with Eiko bound to a cross. She begs her captors to let her go but to no avail. Then, through the forest comes a giant frog creature. Her captors, two reptile-adjacent puppets, watch in fear. Eiko's chastity belt around her arm goes off. This can only mean one thing: the frog monster is attracted to her. It licks her face, triggering the chastity belt, turning her into a superhero: Star Virgin.

Star Virgin breaks out of her binds, grabs the frog monster's tongue, and ties it around a tree. She draws her sword to kill the beast, but it runs away. Safe from harm, she runs to her ship and flies off the reptile planet to her next adventure.

While on her ship, she slips into a bubble bath and records a captain's log of her first week of vacation. Tired of visiting uncivilized planets, she decides to visit a planet on the cusp of civilization called Earth. Once there, she boards her flying scooter and hits the streets.

Dentist double agents, robot butlers, asexual entomologists, and more â€” this superhero tokusatsu is delightfully silly. It's probably too long for what it's offering, but it never stops being whacky.

The music fucking rules! The Star Virgin theme in the credits is a bop.

I need everybody to watch this so I have someone to discuss it with.
