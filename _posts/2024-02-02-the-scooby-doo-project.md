<blockquote><i>In the fall of 1999, four teenaged sleuths and their Great Dane got lost in the woods while in search of a mystery. This is their story.</i></blockquote>

A <i>Blair Witch Project</i> parody with the Scooby Gang. A police investigation into the missing Scooby Gang frames the story. The gang gathers conflicting stories about what's in the woods and so goes to explore the woods themselves.

The video is a collection of snippets used during commercial breaks during a Scooby-Doo marathon.

The clips combine actual footage with the characters animated in the scenes. Otherwise, the characters are human.

In the story, the police find a bag of videos â€” Scooby-Doo episodes and their investigation.

It's pretty fun and meta. I'm glad that folks have assembled this. Cartoon Network's official version doesn't have all the clips.
