<blockquote><i>isn't there some decent way for a person to live</i></blockquote>Muraki is out of prison — nothing's changed it seems, except there's a pretty girl Saeko betting high and losing stacks at the gambling parlor. Still, she's bored and looking for higher stakes. Thankfully, Muraki is Yakuza and can make some arrangements.

The games have a different vibe with Saeko there. And Muraki notices her recklessness extends beyond the gambling parlors. But they're both feeling a similar emptiness, so he goes along for the ride.

The black and white film is so beautiful. Japanese film stock has a magic to it. And Japan at night is a dream regardless. The darkness at the edge of many scenes makes every moment feel more dramatic.

The cacophonous soundtrack creates an added layer of tension that isn't always visible onscreen, like Yakuza waiting for a possible raid.

The dream sequence looks so good! The lighting, the slow motion, the framing — chefs kiss.

My only real complaint is that the gambling parts are pretty boring, but it's essential to the plot, so I don't know.

What a vibe movie! I could have this on all the time. And that ending! Woof
