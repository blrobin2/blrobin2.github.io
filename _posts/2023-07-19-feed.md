**Rating:** 1.5/5

<blockquote><i>Although the events depicted in this film are fictional, they are based on actual behaviors that are happening between consenting adultsâ€¦ right now.</i></blockquote>A killer sets up a web show where he forced-feeds obese women until they die, letting people bet on what weight theyâ€™ll be when they die. He then uses the fat extracted from that woman to force-feed another womanâ€¦ you get it

God, this movie sucks

The killer gets so many speeches about evolution and food â€” he gets maybe 1/4 of the movie to just ramble. His favorite video game as a child was Pac-Man â€” if that gives you any insight into the psychological depth this movie goes

They donâ€™t do a terrible job with the web design/onscreen hacking stuff â€” this is the director of <i>Lawnmower Man</i>, after all ðŸ™„ â€” but of course, they add so many dumb sound effects and voice feedback that it undermines all the effort

Somewhere in the movieâ€™s premise is a conversation on the line between fetishism and dehumanization and how they may not be different things, but this movie wants to provoke you

The leadâ€™s lesson is that he should stop dating horny thin women and start dating women who weigh more so theyâ€™ll be more grateful for his attention

I canâ€™t tell how seriously the movie wants us to take it, but however you cut it, thereâ€™s just not enough there to encourage watching it
