**Rating:** 2/5

<blockquote><i>Do you know the terror of he who falls asleep?
</i><i>To the very toes he is terrified,
</i><i>Because the ground gives way under him,
</i><i>And the dreams begin...
</i><i>— Friedrich Nietzsche</i></blockquote>Freddy enters the 90s with a butt rock soundtrack and a vision of the year 2000 in Springwood, Ohio — killings and suicides wiping out kids and teens, and adults experiencing mass psychosis — one teen survives

Freddy finds that kid and shoots him somewhere elsewhere to fetch something for Freddy — but when he gets there, he has amnesia. He meets a new batch of kids for Freddy to terrorize, but one of the psychologists, Maggie, decides to help the kid get back his memories

The memory mission takes them and some of the other kids back to Springwood, where we'll learn the secrets of Freddy's powers, his child, and, finally, how to kill him

<b>Neat Effects</b>
* Extra-long Q-tip
* Hearing aid with tentacles

<b>Dull Effects</b>
* Dream demons
* Wizard of Oz house drop
* In-a-gadda-da-vida psychedelic trip/video game
* Endless unfolding map

The movie abandons the pretense of horror and goes full cartoon — something I accused earlier ones of doing, but this is trying to be a cartoon, complete with Looney Tunes sound effects — at least for a little bit

I thought I would enjoy this one more than <i>The Dream Child</i> based on how this one started, but once it got down to resolving the plot, it became so tedious

I'll watch <i>New Nightmare</i> another day
