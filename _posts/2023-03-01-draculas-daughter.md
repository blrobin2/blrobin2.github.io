“There are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamed in your psychiatry”

Great moody lighting and costuming, but a stilted script that doesn’t quite know what to do with an interesting idea beyond talk it to death

There’s also a queer reading of this — and in all Draculas I guess — that becomes more overt when the daughter seeks a woman to “paint”. Finding her, she tries to hide the desire from her eyes

Looks like they got to use part of the original Dracula set, which is pretty neat
