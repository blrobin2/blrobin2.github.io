**Rating:** 4/5

<b>*** Stray Thoughts / Spoilers ***</b>
* Anna had a friend who sang "Hey Big Spender" for a high school talent show.
* The nightclub she follows Vittorio to is the most 1969 club ever.
* So many Fosse-isms! His choreography feels like hieroglyphs trying to figure out how to be human.
* Uh oh, I fear I am too much Shirley MacLaine in this movie.
* Her comedic timing, however, is *chef's kiss*
* Cinematography goes for every visual joke it can find, and I love it
* Gaslighting, but make it funny :|
* I wish Bob Fosse had directed <i>The Wiz</i>. This cinematography would have been perfect for the dance numbers.
* I'd like one good thing to happen to Charity.
* Falling in love with an unconscious man is, uh, something.
* The Rhythm of Life mobile is SOO 1969
* Sammy Davis Jr!
* Did I sing "The Rhythm of Life" in chorus??
* "Almost Married"
* Wow, this one hurt a lot.
