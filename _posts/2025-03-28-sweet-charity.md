#### Stray Thoughts / Spoilers

- Anna had a friend who sang "Hey Big Spender" for a high school talent show.
- The nightclub she follows Vittorio to is the most 1969 club ever.
- So many Fosse-isms! His choreography feels like hieroglyphs trying to figure out how to be human.
- Uh oh, I fear I am too much Shirley MacLaine in this movie.
- Her comedic timing, however, is _chef's kiss_
- Cinematography goes for every visual joke it can find, and I love it
- Gaslighting, but make it funny :|
- I wish Bob Fosse had directed <i>The Wiz</i>. This cinematography would have been perfect for the dance numbers.
- I'd like one good thing to happen to Charity.
- Falling in love with an unconscious man is, uh, something.
- The Rhythm of Life mobile is SOO 1969
- Sammy Davis Jr!
- Did I sing "The Rhythm of Life" in chorus??
- "Almost Married"
- Wow, this one hurt a lot.
