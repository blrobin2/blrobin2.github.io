It's wino-o-clock, let's see how handsome boy Timothy Dalton pairs with this pinot noir

#### Stray Thoughts/Spoilers

- I've never seen either of Timothy Dalton's Bonds. My dad hates him, so would never watch them
- A desk in an aircraft hangar is...
- Paintball? War games like Never Say Never Again?
- Dalton looks like someone who fucks, which Roger Moore did not have
- a-ha's theme is pretty good!
- They give Bond such a big gun that he looks like a little boy loading it
- Bond can't bring himself to shoot a beautiful woman, and it causes problems
- The boom box rocket launcher — or as Q calls it, a ghetto blaster
- The macaw from For Your Eyes Only?? John Glen sure loves reusing cast
- Look, I'm not a car girl, but that Aston Martin is nice. Radio scanner AND tape deck?
- ... and laser button, wheel spikes, rocket motor, skis, timed self-destruct
- Driving the shack across the lake — there's some Bond silliness I've missed
- John Barry using a drum machine! I love it
- Is Bond showing a modicum of respect for Kara?
- Georgi's more of a womanizer this time around
- Bond kind of hates his job, huh?
- What the fuck is going on?
- Bond's got squibs on hand?
- Felix is Christian Shephard from Lost!
- Staircar escape! Tres Arrested Development
- Ah, back when the US funded the Mujahideen
- hahaha Joe Don Baker
