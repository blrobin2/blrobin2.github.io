“I’m gonna tell you the truth for once, okay? You need a good beating every once in awhile. All women do, and especially you, okay?” In case there’s any confusion about this movie’s sense of humor, this is the line that gets a woman to take back her abusive boyfriend

That boyfriend wears makeup to look like a movie star, and the girlfriend laughs at him putting it on, so he hits her. Reminiscent of that Margaret Atwood quote — you know the one

In the end, the movie could be read a fucked up way of discussing how society tries to enforce certain expectations of gender, but I may be giving it too much credit
