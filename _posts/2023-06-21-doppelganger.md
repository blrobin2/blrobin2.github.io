**Rating:** 3/5

<blockquote><i>Don’t confuse me with her. She may look like me, but she’s not me.</i></blockquote>Holly (Drew Barrymore) moves to LA, pursued by someone who looks exactly like her. She moves in with Patrick (George Newbern), who learns of her doppelgänger as murders begin to happen around them

No one should win an award for acting — except Leslie Hope, whose comedic delivery keeps several scenes afloat — but Drew Barrymore has a hard time playing out the subtleties of her character present in the script

The non-score music is so 1993 — I love it

Throughout the movie is another critique of Hollywood and genre, but it never amounts to much more than “selling out, am I right?”

The ending is so outrageous, complete with a villain monologue. This movie is not good, but it’s worth watching just for that climax

<b>Stray Thoughts</b>
* Nice Jaid Barrymore cameo
* Danny Trejo is really in everything, isn’t he
* Using a butcher knife to spread jelly on toast is the most psychotic thing Barrymore does
