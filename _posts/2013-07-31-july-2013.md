excerpt: "My favorite albums and singles from the month of July in the 2013th year. "

Note: Thanks to some mid-year catch-up lists, my top 5 includes an album that did not come out this month.

Note2: I fucking scraped for singles to like for most of this month, and then a barrage of great songs came out in the past few days. Obviously, this isn't an anomolous event; it just shows how, no matter what scale you work on, your list always has a possibility of being re-written at the last second.
