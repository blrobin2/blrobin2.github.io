I don’t know what to say, this was a bad movie. I can’t think of one thing it did well

Nothing felt like it had stakes, no character had more than a single-line description that summed up their entire personality, the pacing was a slog because no clear objectives  were ever set, and the costumes looked so cheap

If nothing else, they should’ve focused on the fights, but every single one was so anime-core that they stood and talked, the camera blurred for a few minutes, and then the fight was over. No choreography, just quick cuts, and if you did see the fight it was CGI

I think people are gaslighting themselves into liking this because Hideaki Anno wrote and directed it, but if he put any amount of care into this, it wouldn’t look and feel so hacked together

Perhaps it was too beholden to the 70s TV show, and if I had seen the show I would like it more. Maybe I’m in the wrong state of mind to appreciate what it’s doing. But in the end I had a bad time
