**Rating:** 3.5/5

An "oblivion virus" that erases memories wanders in a city polluted by acid rain and lead poisoning. Many people started to visit to get rid of their painful memories
<blockquote><i>You see the butterflies? They'll guide us to the virus</i></blockquote>Anna arrives in Korea and meets her virus guide, a pregnant teenage girl named Yuki. With the aid of their driver, K, they go to construction sites where the virus has been spotted, but Anna doesn't seem to be able to catch it

Yuki shows Anna where Yuki keeps the memories of people she guided to the virus. They watch the memories of one girl in particular
<blockquote><i>I think she hoped someone would remember her pain</i></blockquote>Not only can Anna not catch the virus, but her driver never takes her to the hotel, driving around and giving people rides. K is an orphan who wants to find his family — he hopes someone he picks up will recognize him so that he can reclaim his past

The film is an extended metaphor for Korean identity in a post-colonialist, globalized world. The construction sites where the virus is are sites for future malls and fast-food places. As American products and media make their way over to Korea, many Koreans choose to adopt a more American way of life — perhaps forgetting their ancestral and cultural history (at least, according to the director)

Being shot in the early 2000s on digital video means some shots look alright, but others have that uncanny home video quality. In some ways, this helps to ground the story and enhance the feeling that we are also watching the memories of someone's pain

Overall, the film is atmospheric and has slow cinema qualities, taking a high concept and making an intimate human portrait — not an original idea, but a well-executed version of it
