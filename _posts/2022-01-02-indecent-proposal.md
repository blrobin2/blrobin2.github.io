**Rating:** 2/5

I don’t understand why Demi Moore dates Robert Redford other than what Woody Harrison says: he has money. And it felt like her character wouldn’t be drawn by that… but I guess movies from this era loved saying that as long as a man is persistent, he can get whatever he wants… yikes!
