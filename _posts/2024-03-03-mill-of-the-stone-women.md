<i>CW // Suicide, Abuse, Misogyny, Mental Illness, Murder</i>

Hans van Arnim arrived by boat at a remote island in Holland. He seeks out Professor Wahl, a famous sculptor. Wahl maintains what the locals call the Mill of the Stone Women — a carousel of wax figures in distressing scenes.

Hans is writing a piece on the carousel, and he must finish it before the installation's centennial.

Grim statues fill the professor's studio, including one of a nude woman hanging from a rope.

Hans meets Wahl's daughter, Elfie. She behaves strangely, but Hans is into it, to the chagrin of his girlfriend, Lisolette. Elfie asks him to meet her at the windmill at night. But when Elfie sees Hans with Lisolette, she demands to have him to herself. They argue, and she dies in his arms.

But things are not as they appear. Is Hans ill, or something sinister at play?

The movie has a perfect gothic tone, with beautiful sets and costumes. Being the first Italian horror movie shot in color, they went all out.

The statues are so wild — they freak me out!

The movie is at its best during a fever dream in which Hans cannot discern hallucination from reality. It feels like we're stuck with him in this state.

The ending is horrifying and has some all-time great images.

This movie is outstanding gothic horror — Hammer rarely reached similar heights.
