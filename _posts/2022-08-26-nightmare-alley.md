**Rating:** 2.5/5

A pretty picture, artfully designed, but it stops working the moment we leave the carnival for the noir story. It seems the movie could only take the beats and snippets of dialogue from the noir genre, but it didn’t have the vision to marry it to the production design. In the end, it’s a 2.5 hr Twilight Zone with none of the magic and all of the brow-beating morality
