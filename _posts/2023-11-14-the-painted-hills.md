Beautifully photographed — great matte paintings and sets! Lassie is a true star, she's so dang cute.

- I'd hire someone from congress, but they're out having sex
- Is Lassie gonna teach us good grooming techniques too?
- He had sand on his lap and he needed help?
- Egg nog. Make it a double
- C'mon, pretend you like me, girl!
- He's gotta be careful or he'll fall into that matte painting
- They're really making him work for his death
- Life is pain, Tommy
- Either this boy is dead or his heart has stopped
- The Most Tedious Game
