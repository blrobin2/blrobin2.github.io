**Rating:** 2.5/5

Beautifully photographed — great matte paintings and sets! Lassie is a true star, she's so dang cute.

* I'd hire someone from congress, but they're out having sex
* Is Lassie gonna teach us good grooming techniques too?
* He had sand on his lap and he needed help?
* Egg nog. Make it a double 
* C'mon, pretend you like me, girl!
* He's gotta be careful or he'll fall into that matte painting
* They're really making him work for his death
* Life is pain, Tommy
* Either this boy is dead or his heart has stopped
* The Most Tedious Game
