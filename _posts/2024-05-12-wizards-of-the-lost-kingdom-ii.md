**Rating:** 1/5

The liquid movie distributor leaking is a decent lampshade for when they have to make cuts to the movie for time/content.

I got this director, Charles B. Griffith, mixed up with <i>The Legend of Boggy Creek</i> director Charles B. Pierce. It is left as an exercise to the reader to determine which director is better.

I thought Robert Jayne was the brother in <i>The Wonder Years</i>. He wasn't, but he was in an episode of <i>The Wonder Years</i> the year before this movie. The brother was Jason Hervey. [edit:] The <i>MST3K</i> guys made this observation too!

I accidentally got too high to tell if this movie is any good. David Carradine wears a sword the whole time, so it's 50/50.

* I can't help it — I love laughing!
* Someone's been reading the comments on his blog posts
* Don't pander at me!
* He's artistic — severely artistic
* Is the bathroom for paying customers only, or...?
* Finally, something from a badger's point of view
* Violins!
* Overhand!
* She just murdered a mime. And our heroes are delighted!
* Let my wizards go!
