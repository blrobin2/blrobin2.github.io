Great costumes, the deck of cards was cute, and the only scene that looked meh was the initial growing and shrinking because it looks filmed on a stage, whereas the rest has sets

Last I read, this was lost, so I’m so glad we have some version of it, even if it’s damaged and 4 minutes are still lost
