A rich guy is afraid of being buried alive because his father was buried alive. Everyone tells him he's crazy, but the fear overwhelms him, leaving him frozen in his efforts to circumvent the possibility

I like the aesthetic, but the story is so similar to <i>The Pit and the Pendulum</i>. The progression of the story has no meaningful development, at least nothing you can't assume once the movie establishes the lead's delusion

The absence of Vincent Price is my disappointment and not a flaw of the movie, but it leaves me wondering if I would've liked it more if Price played Ray Milland's role

Still, this has all the bearings of a comfort movie for me, so I still enjoyed it

<b>Stray Thoughts</b>

- Dark, moody "Molly Malone" is so funny
- The nightmare sequence where his screams are horns and the air is a green mist stands out
- For a guy who's afraid of being trapped in his mausoleum, he sure does spend a lot of time there
