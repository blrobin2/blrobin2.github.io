Underwater volcano eruption? A boiling sea? A creature on the ocean floor

A giant tail bursts from the water — "Giant Unidentified Life Form"

As Japan tries to make a single decision, the creature changes forms — he can adapt to his environment because something something radiation

By the time the military strikes, it's in its 4th form. The American government gives it the codename Godzilla

This movie has all of the Godzilla bureaucracy you could ask for, as different Japanese committees meet to determine their course of action

Once he started glowing pink, I got more on board — about an hour in — after that, another 45 minutes before we saw him again

This movie, being the third of the Shin films I've watched — after <i>Shin Ultraman</i> and <i>Shin Kamen Rider</i> — doesn't do it any favors, especially when <i>Shin Ultraman</i> was wall-to-wall monsters

Still, I had a pleasant time watching this
