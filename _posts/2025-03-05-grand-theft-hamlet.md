**Rating:** 3/5

<blockquote><i>This film is shot entirely inside the video game Grand Theft Auto Online, a violent and beautiful virtual world where almost anything is possible…</i></blockquote>

Sam and Mark are actors out of work as the UK enters its third lockdown. While running from the police, Sam stumbles across the Vinewood Bowl, an amphitheater based on LA's Hollywood Bowl. He thinks about putting on a play on the stage, and Mark gives a speech from Hamlet.

So, Sam sends an online message that they will perform Hamlet at the Vinewood Bowl. As he finishes his message, a guy lands on the stage in a helicopter. Another guy shows up, and a shootout commences. Sam and Mark deliver their lines while a police copter hovers over them. A cop kills Sam, bringing their show to an early end.

Sam's partner, Pinny, creates a new character and meets Sam at his apartment. She asks them about the viability of producing Hamlet in GTA Online. Mark doesn't think it's possible, but if they're going to do it, they need more people. Things are looking grim until a player comes to audition.

So, let's get this out of the way — this isn't a documentary. Its scripted nature becomes more apparent when other online players join in. Also, moments of fun seeming randomness come to a grinding halt with discussions of COVID, lockdown, and joblessness.

I don't think these details ruin the movie. I enjoyed watching the process unfold. But I wasn't excited about it and wouldn't necessarily recommend it unless the concept appeals to you.
