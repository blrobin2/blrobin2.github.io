**Rating:** 3/5

Black and white kaiju movies are the best kaiju movies.

The show is barely concerned with the bad movie as torture conceit. Joel says he dug into the archives for this one.

Only Joel riffs on this one, and he says some funny things!

* And that's his foot. Oh, no, wait, that's his head
* He wants to make a museum out of his shell. That's what I bet he wants.
* To find a turtle, you gotta think like a turtle. I think you can handle it
* Gamera asks about you, Kenny
