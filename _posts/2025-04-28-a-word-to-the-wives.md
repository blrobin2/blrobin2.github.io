<b>From Rifftrax Live: MST3K Reunion</b>

Mary Jo Pehl and Bridgett Jones Nelson riffing

- A word to the wives… from these husbands! _points to director, writer, etc.._
- — I'll show you a couple of my prize beauties. — Is she going to take her shirt off?
- Hey Jimmy, how much of this baking soda do you want for dinner?
- Fury — the dad emotion!
- By the way, did you know that this kitchen won an award from the Woman's Home Companion? The Sylvia Plath award!
