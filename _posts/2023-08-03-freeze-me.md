**Rating:** 2.5/5

Three yakuza attack and rape Chihiro when she is in high school, filming the whole thing. Afraid of the stigma that would follow, she kept it a secret. Years later, she moved to the city, leaving behind a place and people that reminded her of her past

But when the three men leave prison, they each visit Chihiro, throwing her life into chaos, physically and psychologically abusing her. And so, she murders each one, buying a freezer to keep their bodies in. Her revenge, however, has frozen her in place, tending to the bodies she keeps on ice

What works best for me is the structure of the story — we spend quite a bit of time with the lead after she gets her revenge

Unfortunately, the freezer bit quickly becomes hammy as she talks to the bodies or reaches by one to grab an ice cream — the movie didn't need to focus dourly on the trauma, but it could do less trivializing of the entire experience

I didn't hate it, didn't love it
