In June 1967, D.A. Pennebaker, with the help of Albert Maysles and Richard Leacock, filmed the Monterey International Pop Festival. Several of the most iconic images from live music of the era come from this documentary, including Jimi Hendrix burning his guitar.

As a document of a point in time, this film is essential â€” the violent death of the folk movement in favor of what trust-fund hippies considered "authentic."

If you love these bands, this movie rocks. But I don't like most of the artists on here, so...

I'm getting high to watch this â€” I hope it helps.

- Hugh Masekela ruled.
- Canned Heat is in hell now.
- I get Janis Joplin now.
- The Who sure is loud.
- So much of the behind-the-scenes are just cameramen creeping on pretty girls.
- Otis Redding ðŸ˜¢
- I love how much Jimi Hendrix freaked out the audience.
