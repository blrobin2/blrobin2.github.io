**Rating:** 3/5

An exercise in shorthands â€” Clooney and Pitt finish each other's thoughts so they don't have to be said out loud, scenes give us as much information as needed and little else. The result is fast and fun, but the characters are empty and the stakes are nil

Was this the last time Soderbergh knew how to light a scene?
