**Rating:** 2/5

For some reason, they showed this episode after the sequel this season. I still can't find the KTMA <i>Star Force: Fugitive Alien II</i> episode, but I'm also not looking super hard yet. Both movies are two episodes of <i>Star Wolf</i> soldered together. Sandy Frank, not Gerry Anderson.

Joel and Tom Servo in this episode. Tom disassembled Crow for some reason. This is the episode where they introduce the <i>MST3K</i> Fan Club.

The temperature shows on the screen at one point for Minnesota. 2Â° F. Kill me.

Amazing opening for the movie. I think I got high enough to understand it this time.
