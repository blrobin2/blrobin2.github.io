**Rating:** 3.5/5

My friend Adam told me that this movie is supposed to be better if you skip the first 5 minutes of the movie. He’s seen the movie, I haven’t, so I thought I would try it out and see how I like it

Around 2/3 in, I guessed that the opening would’ve spoiled who Rapunzel is, who the mother is, the hair magic… Not knowing really gives this movie a sense of wonder and discovery that, frankly, never happens in kids movies

And of course, it’s not like you couldn’t guess it from several context clues, but not having it spelled out for you makes you feel like you are taking part in putting the pieces together

Overall, it’s still a Disney princess movie with a happily ever after ending, but it made some creative and visual choices that makes this one stand out from the others

This movie is one star better without those first 5 minutes, I highly recommend skipping them too
