**Rating:** 3/5

Peter Toombes (Vincent Price) is an actor famous for his horror movie roles, most notably as the serial killer Dr. Death. At an award show in his honor, someone murders his fianc√© in a fashion identical to one of Dr. Death's. Distraught, he steps away from the limelight and goes into a mental health facility

Some years later, Toombes' friend and the writer/creator of Dr.  Death, Herbert Flay (Peter Cushing), reaches out to him for the opportunity to reprise his Dr. Death role. But no sooner than he begins filming, the murders start happening again, leaving Toombes' horrified that he may be doing them and not realizing it

The film is standard fare for Price and Cushing, and the prospect of them working on a film together is more exciting than the execution. The movie contains several clips from old Vincent Price flicks, and seeing those juxtaposed with the movie itself does it no favors

The best character is Flay's wife, Faye (Adrienne Corri), who worked on an old Dr. Death movie and received numerous injuries that left her scarred and disfigured. Whether by Flay's decree or her own, she occupies the basement, where she tends to her spiders, her babies

Not an amazing movie, but a fun little flick for the 60s and 70s horror fans
