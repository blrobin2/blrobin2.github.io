I've been revisiting the past decade in music, trying to catch all the music I didn't the first time around, as well as revisit some old favorites. When I finish with each year, I'll post a list of my personal favorite 10 from that year. I encourage you to listen to any you haven't, as well as tell me what you think, what should be on here that isn't, what is on here that shouldn't be, etc.

- 10: Deerhoof - The Runners Four
- 9: Clap Your Hands Say Yeah - Clap Your Hands Say Yeah
- 8: My Morning Jacket - Z
- 7: Andrew Bird - ...And the Mysterious Production of Eggs
- 6: Animal Collective - Feels
- 5: Bloc Party - Silent Alarm
- 4: Wolf Parade - Apologies to Queen Mary
- 3: LCD Soundsystem - LCD Soundsystem
