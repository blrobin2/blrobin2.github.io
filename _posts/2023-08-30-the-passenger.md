<blockquote><i>— People disappear every day
</i><i>— Every time they leave the room</i></blockquote>David Locke is a journalist in Chad during a civil war, trying to reach the guerrillas to complete a documentary. At a hostel, he meets David Robertson — an English businessman who shares an uncanny resemblance to Locke

Later, Locke discovers Robertson dead in his room. So, Locke switches out their passports, changes clothes, and reports to the hostel that David Locke is dead

Locke soon learns that he has assumed the identity of an arms dealer supplying the guerrillas and that his life may be in danger. The role pays handsomely, but the cost of playing it is high

The film is a study of a man who has no politics — a "philosophical detachment" as the obituary — assuming the role of someone with such strong beliefs that he would put his life on the line for it

Locke believes his problem is his old habits and that even by becoming a passenger in someone else's life, he will still "experience the same old codes." But of course, once this life takes the steering wheel from him, all he can do is keep this identity's appointments

Antonioni's style translates brilliantly in some ways and disappointingly in others. His formal camera work and visual perfection work great, but his characters' philosophical musings feel less profound coming out of English-speaking mouths

Still, this is a satisfying blend of arthouse sensibilities and mainstream storytelling

#### Stray Thoughts

- The scene with him on the gondola, his arms outstretched through the window, flying over the water — the mistaken sense that his change has granted him freedom
- The single-take final shot is top-tier
