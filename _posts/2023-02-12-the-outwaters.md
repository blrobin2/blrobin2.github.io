**Rating:** /5

It’s hard to formulate an opinion, especially when the guys sitting next to me kept sighing, groaning, or laughing

This definitely isn’t a film for most horror fans. It is found footage, but it’s trying to do something different. If I can say anything, it absolutely goes for it — I can honestly say I’ve never seen a movie quite like this

I’ll be thinking about this one…
