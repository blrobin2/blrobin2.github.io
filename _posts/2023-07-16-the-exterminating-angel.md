**Rating:** 5/5

After an opera, a rich dude hosts a dinner party. But after the help leave and everyone stays the night, they discover that they cannot leave the room they’re in

What can I say? It’s a surrealist masterpiece — Buñuel sharpens his focus from his earlier work and makes a critique of wealth and the state that is as relevant now as it was then

A big reason is that it does not explicitly reference any historical events or figures, but instead slowly says the quiet parts out loud: appeals to decency, moments of silence, calls for dispassionate rationality

It also captures the tensions felt during quarantine — the typhoid quarantine is explicitly referenced — the loss of control, the constant proximity, the indefinite length
