Angela Bettis is May, a girl who grew up with a lazy eye and a mother that couldn’t bear imperfection. Unable to make friends, her mother gives her a homemade doll named Soozy to be her friends

As an adult, she is a vet tech by day, a tailor by night, who fixates on people’s body parts — her coworker’s neck, this cute boy’s hands — but never really got the whole socialization down

Angela Bettis is perfect in this. She has a lot of notes to hit, and she does it all so well

God, this movie fucked with me. It’s so hard to be funny, grotesque, earnest, and successfully so — it broke my heart and made me gag. What more can you ask for?

#### Stray Thoughts (Spoiler-ish?)

- Scalpel play makes me cringe so much!
- Argento’s Opera poster in his room, retractable knife on the mantle, diet weirdo
- Blind kids feeling around in broken glass made me cringe too!
- The swirl of blood and milk on the kitchen floor looks cool
