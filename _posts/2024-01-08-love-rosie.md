Alex and Rosie have been best friends since they were kids. Since a boy and a girl can't be friends, Alex realizes he must love her romantically. Since he's a stupid boy, he doesn't tell her.

As time progresses, Rosie realizes that she also loves Alex. But oops! She becomes pregnant and, being Catholic keeps the baby.

Over time, people marry and divorce, often realizing their feelings when the other makes a life-changing choice.

This cast has handsome British boys handpicked from a Calvin Kline ad to be unlikely lovers. Sam Claflin's Alex has his Colin Firth-isms down.

Lily Collins as Rosie gives an emotional and heartfelt performance. She and Sam Claflin have good on-screen chemistry.

While the movie has its merits, tired tropes and excessive montages dilute it. It's also too long.

It's not a disaster and kept me invested the entire time. It's a pity that a film with promise is only fine.
