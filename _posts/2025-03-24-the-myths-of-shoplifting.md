**Rating:** /5

* It went perfectly, just like my neighbor's dog said it would.
* Is this the myth where Hercules picks up a 7-Eleven?
* We all pay for the selfishness of shoplifters. But the romance of their untamed hearts is worth it.
* What the hell's a pentagle?
* I could impose a jail sentence, however, I find caning much more satisfying.
