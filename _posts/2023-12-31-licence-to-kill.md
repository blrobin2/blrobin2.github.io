#### Stray Thoughts/Spoilers

- Score by the guy who did the X-Files theme
- Felix is getting married. Seems like a risky move for a CIA guy
- Also, bringing back a Felix finally... from like 10 movies ago
- How could they see is was Felix in the helicopter?
- Bond was married once... 30 years ago
- Guess we're gonna watch a shark eat a guy. Brutal
- I know Bond is a commander, but it feels weird when everyone calls him that
- Dude, hanging Sharky like a fish is deeply fucked
- Hell yeah, 89 Laserdisc player
- Bar fight with swords, table dancers keep dancing — consummate professionals
- MI6 is still supporting Bond despite his resignation
- Banks gladly accept suitcases full of cash, no questions asked
- Blackjack? Not baccarat?
- I'm dumb as hell, I didn't know "double down" was a gambling term
- Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa AND Talisa Soto? They'll reunite in 1995. Not for Goldeneye, but for Mortal Kombat
- Oh that dude's head exploded
- And that's it for Dalton and Cold War era Bond! Once he comes back in 95, they'll have to figure out how to make him make sense. But that's for another movie marathon
