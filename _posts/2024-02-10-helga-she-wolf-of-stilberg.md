<b>What happens when you forget the title of <i>Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS</i>? You end up watching <i>Hegla, She Wolf of Spilberg</i>.</b>

In the South American Banana Republic, President Steiner sends political prisoners to a fortress cum concentration camp. He names Helga as the camp’s leader. Straight away, she has a non-consensual lesbian affair with one prisoner, which relieves them of chore duties. Soon after, she has sex with one guard.

When the prisoners (all women) arrive at the camp, a farmer named Doc feels all of them up. One refuses and receives punishment, AKA SA from Doc while Helga watches.

Everything is “whips and flogging” until a prisoner named Elizabeth shows up, with whom Helga falls in love. Or, you know, whatever you call it when a Nazi wants to have sex with you.

Wow, this is boring! Long scenes of eating, guards changing station. Why is this 96 minutes?!

Half-star for chronic nudity, although there are endless, more reputable naked people delivery services.
