Gene Kelly?? Lauren Hutton?? Leslie Nielsen?? Oh, Cameron Mitchell, that makes sense.

This Evel Knievel vanity project is a strange one—he thinks he's in a kid's movie, the movie thinks it's an action flick, and I'm starting to think Evel Knieval's kind of a dick!

- Evel needs more room! You're smothering him—let the relationship grow naturally!
- I have a good mind to jump over you!
- Is that Revlon she's wearing? That lip color just won't fade!
- Hi, I'm here for the symbolic framing shot!
- There's gotta be a way I can drink my tools.
- Injured orphans of the world, prepare to be healed.
- There's gotta be a Snake River Canyon to jump somewhere in here!
- — Don't call me Shirley. — I didn't!
- Who in their right mind listens to a bike jump on the radio?
- This is the Fitzcarraldo of stunt bike movies.
