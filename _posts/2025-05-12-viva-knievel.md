**Rating:** 1.5/5

Gene Kelly?? Lauren Hutton?? Leslie Nielsen?? Oh, Cameron Mitchell, that makes sense.

This Evel Knievel vanity project is a strange one—he thinks he's in a kid's movie, the movie thinks it's an action flick, and I'm starting to think Evel Knieval's kind of a dick!

* Evel needs more room! You're smothering him—let the relationship grow naturally!
* I have a good mind to jump over you!
* Is that Revlon she's wearing? That lip color just won't fade!
* Hi, I'm here for the symbolic framing shot!
* There's gotta be a way I can drink my tools.
* Injured orphans of the world, prepare to be healed.
* There's gotta be a Snake River Canyon to jump somewhere in here!
* — Don't call me Shirley. — I didn't!
* Who in their right mind listens to a bike jump on the radio?
* This is the Fitzcarraldo of stunt bike movies.
