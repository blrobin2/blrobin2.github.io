* [dark, mysterious "Take Me Out to the Ballgame"]
* I heal you in the name of skiing
* I'm sure I wouldn't have a series of hypodermic needles sticking out of my stomach without a good reason
* Ah, the bats are playing the harp
* And just remember, if you are bitten by a bat, you will turn into one. It's a scientific fact!
* Look â€” I'm married and I'm a bat.
* Don't jump into bed, you'll spill my nachos
* Holy squeak
* What the squeak?
