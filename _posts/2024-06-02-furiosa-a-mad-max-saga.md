This movie has every flaw a prequel could have â€” it is entirely in service of another film with nothing new to offer.

The special effects are so cartoony that the movie leaks tension like a slashed gas line. The CGI buries whatever practical effects are present, so they may as well have done the whole film on a green screen.

This was a difficult watch.
