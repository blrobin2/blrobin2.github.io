**Rating:** 4.5/5

Sandrine Bonnaire had me on the verge of tears — that coping mechanism of disassociating in front of the TV is so recognizable, that fear of the wrong person discovering the real you and the lack of control you feel

I’ve never seen Isabelle Huppert this chill — or maybe chaotic — is there anything she can’t do?

The final act doesn’t feel motivated to me, but I’ll admit I probably missed some subtext throughout
