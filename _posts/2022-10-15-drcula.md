It’s surreal watching a different Dracula movie but with all the same sets, the same general structure, even some shared footage

It’s way longer though and does a lot more dudes sitting around trying to figure out Dracula’s deal

There are some shots in this movie that look modern, the cinematography is quite dynamic and overall better composed compared to the English language Dracula
