**Rating:** 2/5

The monster rules — nowhere near enough screen time

* And I, Dr. Woof Woof Lombardi
* [warmly] hello, wall
* — I hate you — I can't help but feel like that was directed at me
* Pigeon kidneys turned out runny again
* Just letting the neighborhood know about the new Red Lobster
* Death by murphy bed
* Beach Closed, all sand must go!
* Sometimes I just trail off, I...
* What?
* His emotional memory is the previous scene
