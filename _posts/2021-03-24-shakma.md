**Rating:** 2.5/5

The plot had the rigid construction of a railroad-y D&D campaign, to the point where there are fairly dull stretches as it tries to get its characters in the right locations for the right set pieces to unfold

It has some solid character beats and some okay gore. If it were 20-30 minutes shorter, it would have real “good bad movie with friends” potential

**spoilers below**

The fact that the lead guy doesn’t try to bring back one of the love interests with the same serum that made the baboon super strong is a real missed opportunity
