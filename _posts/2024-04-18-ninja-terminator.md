<blockquote><i>— I’m looking for a restaurant
— You’re looking in the wrong place, buddy. There aren’t any restaurants around here.
— [Fight]</i></blockquote><b>Japan</b>
Three ninjas in black convene and look inside a glowing box. Inside, a statue called the Golden Ninja Warrior sits in three pieces. Their master, Supreme Ninja, dressed in red, joins the three pieces together.

The ninjas take turns slicing at their master, unable to harm him. The three — Tamashi, Baron, and Harry — each take a piece of the Golden Ninja Warrior and flee. There are a lot of sped-up stair descends and flips.

<b>Hong Kong, Two Years Later</b>
A servant of Supreme Ninja kills Tamashi and reclaims his piece of the statue. At Tamashi’s funeral, Ikaza tells Machiko he’ll figure this out.

Tiger, in a beautiful blonde wig, tells the crime lord Baron about Tamashi’s death. Baron sends Tiger to get Tamashi’s statue piece from Ikaza.

Ninja Master Harry sends Jaguar Wong to protect Machiko. Baron and Harry suspect the other is trying to get the Golden Ninjas Warrior pieces.

The script is incoherent. Part of this is Godfrey Ho’s filmmaking method. Ho would film footage to add to footage from existing movies to make a new story, usually involving ninjas. Over 50% of this movie is <i><a href="https://boxd.it/a3Le" rel="nofollow">The Uninvited Guest of the Star Ferry</a></i>.

The Garfield phone is fucking iconic.
