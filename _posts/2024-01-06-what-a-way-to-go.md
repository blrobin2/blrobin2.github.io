**Rating:** 2.5/5

Louisa, a recent widow, tries to give the IRS her inherited millions. No one believes the money is real, so they send her to a psychiatrist, where she recounts her four marriages.

Each marriage (except one oddball) starts with easy living and simple love — what Louisa wants. Invariably, she makes a recommendation or thought, and that husband makes it big and brings in a ton of money, putting a wedge between her and the husband. In their efforts, each husband comes to an untimely end, leaving her with more and more money.

The oddball is her marriage to Rod Anderson Jr, who is already rich. He wins her over by not taking a business call. With him, she goes through a dozen stunning dresses. This lavish life is now what she wants because at least Rod tells her he loves her.

The clothes are all incredible — the filmmakers gave Edith Head carte blanche to make the most audacious pieces.

The sets are solid, but the all-pink house is my favorite.

The movie is too long, though. The formula is clear after the second marriage, leaving me bored while anticipating the next two's downfall.

Shirley MacLaine is perfect. She hits every beat and gives the most memorable performance of the movie.

Paul Newman is hot, and Gene Kelly is adorable and gay. Dick Van Dyke is Dick Van Dyke — zany, physical, but scrambling with a loose script. Robert Mitchum has a deep voice that rivals Stephin Merritt.

I like the aesthetics! That's about it.
