**Rating:** 3/5

The movie ambles along for most of its runtime with a campy vibe, but once things break it feels closer to <i>Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer</i>. I’m not sure how to feel about that, considering these are pretty faithful recreations of real murders

The Mahler music cues are so weird, but it somehow works
