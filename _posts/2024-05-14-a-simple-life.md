<blockquote><i>Chung Chun-Tao, known as Ah Tao, was born in Taishan and adopted as an infant. Her adoptive father died under the Japanese occupation. Her adoptive mother sent Ah Tao to work as a servant for the Leung family. She has served four generations of the family over a span of 60 years.</i></blockquote>

Roger Leung reflects on his life as he boards a train.

<blockquote><i>Ah Tao was already with my family when I was born. At 20, I went to college in the States. At 30, I came back to Hong Kong and since then, Ah Tao has been with me. That is, until two years ago…</i></blockquote>

Roger is a film producer who travels for work. When he returns home, Ah Tao cooks decadent meals for him — not for his tastes, but for the fussy ones she has passed down to Roger.

One day, Roger returns home, ringing the bell. But A Tao doesn’t answer. He enters to find her on the floor. He calls an ambulance. With Ah Tao in the hospital, he reads the instruction manuals for the stovetop and washing machine.

While at the hospital, Roger learns that Ah Tao had a stroke and will need rehabilitation. Ah Tao opts out, wishing to retire. Roger finds a place run by an old friend who will give him a discount.

Ah Tao tries to adjust to life among people who are far less capable than her, as well as food less enjoyable than her home cooking. When Roger visits, he claims to be her godson (in real life, Deanie Ip is, in fact, Andy Lau’s godmother). The two grow closer and their dynamic deepens as they learn to see the entire person before them.

I love Deanie Ip in this. Her performance doesn’t feel like acting — she has a naturalism to every emotion I can’t recall seeing in another actor.

Andy Lau is charming. Watching his transformation is delightful. He and Deanie Ip have acted so much together that their on-screen chemistry feels effortless.

The film is a slice-of-life, uninterested in drama or big speeches. It has a grim sense of humor when observing the disassociation and frustration at the end of life. Having someone watch over you can make all the difference between misery and joy.

The film is full of cameos from famous Chinese film stars and producers. I recognized Sammo Hung and Tsui Hark, just because I’ve looked them up. 

If I had one complaint, it would be the length. The story deserves a relaxed pace, especially when it's about developing relationships. However, I am particular about film length, so this might not pose an issue for you.

This film beautifully showcases the profound impact of a simple life.
