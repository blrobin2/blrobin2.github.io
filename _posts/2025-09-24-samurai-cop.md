**Rating:** 1.5/5

* When a samurai illegally parks in a loading zone between the hours of 8 AM and 6 PM, Samurai Cop is there.
* Live Free or Die Z'Dar!
* I have no opinion on that. Or I do!
* — I can't, but I'll be home later on. — Isn't that true of all people who have a home?
* You like tiramisu? Dan's not gonna finish his.
* And that's when the Viagra kicked in.
* I'm finished... no! Remember your Chumbawamba training!
* Leave him alone! Why are you being so mean?!
* This weather stripping is shot! She's gonna get ants!
* Getaway in an untended vehicle? This man knows his Sun Tzu.
* Oh me? Just fiddling with a gun in front of this mom curtain.
* And now my elbow crease is properly lubricated with blood and sinew.
