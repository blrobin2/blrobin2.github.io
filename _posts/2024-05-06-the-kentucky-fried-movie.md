<blockquote><i>The popcorn you're eating has been pissed in. Film at 11.</i></blockquote>
With that cold open, we enter the film's disconnected and zany world. From news reports to exploitation, the movie is a collection of spoofs and satirical renditions of pop culture media.

The result feels like an American <i>Flying Circus</i> and about half as clever.

<blockquote><i>Pisces: it's a good time to pull the plug on that machine that's been keeping your daughter alive for the past six months.</i></blockquote>
This movie is John Landis' breakthrough as director. The success of this movie is what landed him the <i>Animal House</i> gig.

This movie is also the first written by Zucker, Abrahams, and Zucker. This movie allowed them to write and direct <i>Airplane!</i>

<blockquote><i>Donald Sutherland as the clumsy waiter</i></blockquote>
While no one is on their A-game, the movie had me laughing occasionally. As a 70s movie, there are several references that I don't get, but that might make them funnier.

The longest-running bit is a kung-fu parody. It's mostly racism as the joke, so it drags down the experience. Similarly, one "joke" is a guy walking into a circle of black men and yelling the N-word.

While I mostly like this, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. Just watch <i>Airplane!</i>
