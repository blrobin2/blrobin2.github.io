**Rating:** 3/5

I forgot I watched this when it came out, but as I watched I remembered the disappointment I felt. I really liked Rory Scoval and all of his standup I had seen up to that point was so funny. And like, this isn’t bad, but it’s just not the caliber of any of his late night appearances
