**Rating:** 3/5

The dubbing on this is exceptionally bad. Several characters just stopping mid-sentence and waiting a second between phrases because they can't make the cadence work

This one is so much more action-packed and dynamic compared to <i>Gamera vs. Gynos</i>

This is the one where Gamera spins on the bar, it rules

* are we not mom or am i devo?
* ðŸŽµ i am the twisted, lonely guy
* Ernest Borgnine is Gamera
* We've secretly switched meteors with Folgers Crystals
* ðŸŽµ Gamera is very sweet! He is filled with turtle meat!
* In space, no one can hear you spin
* my mother's donuts are a saint!
* it's a great day to die
