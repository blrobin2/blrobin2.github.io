I decided to check out the other Hill - Newman - Redford flick. While Newman and Redford have plenty of charm and banter, the script is pretty weak. It does that <i>Midnight Cowboy</i> thing of two guys who got lost on the road to nowhere in particular.

The film, like <i>The Sting</i>, has plenty of style and montage out the wazoo. The Burt Bacharach score is memorable, especially "Raindrops Keep Falling on my Head."

I enjoyed the performances, and a couple of the gags had me laughing. Itâ€™s not a bad movie at all, it just doesn't do much for me.
