I took a massive risk by watching this sequel before the original <i>Omega Cop</i>, but I trusted the movie to gently guide me into its rich and multifaceted universe.

- A cop? That knows karate?? This is unheard of!
- Thumbs up to cheese fries! Thumbs down to cheese without fries.
- — It's right here. You get in and out. It's simple. — Yeah, simple, that's what they said about zippers.
- Stop pretending we shot this scene in this same place. You don't even know where I am!
- Jellicle cats! Get him!
- My only regret is dying over stew payment methods!
- Aww, he's dreaming about using excessive force on a civilian.
- Karate forever!
- You forgot one thing—me. (Real movie quote)
- Assholes to ashes. Dictators to dust. (Also, real movie quote)
