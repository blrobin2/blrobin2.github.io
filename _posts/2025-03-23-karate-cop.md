**Rating:** 1/5

I took a massive risk by watching this sequel before the original <i>Omega Cop</i>, but I trusted the movie to gently guide me into its rich and multifaceted universe.

* A cop? That knows karate?? This is unheard of!
* Thumbs up to cheese fries! Thumbs down to cheese without fries.
* — It's right here. You get in and out. It's simple. — Yeah, simple, that's what they said about zippers.
* Stop pretending we shot this scene in this same place. You don't even know where I am!
* Jellicle cats! Get him!
* My only regret is dying over stew payment methods!
* Aww, he's dreaming about using excessive force on a civilian.
* Karate forever!
* You forgot one thing—me. (Real movie quote)
* Assholes to ashes. Dictators to dust. (Also, real movie quote)
