**Rating:** 2/5

* Q??
* Maynard from Tool??
* He just leaves Eve over and over??
* So much racism in this movie! Like most of the dialogue :(
* Kaiju fight??
* Ginger Spice???
* Lloyd Kaufman??
* From the blooper reel, they let the protesting porn stars improv, which I love
* If Troma put this out 20 years earlier, I would understand it better
