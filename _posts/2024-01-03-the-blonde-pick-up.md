**Rating:** 1/5

Mike's wife is back as Lisa Loeb

* No wonder people went nuts over The Beatles — this is all there was
* Wait a minute — is this gonna be about wrestling?
* When Ed Wood saw this, it was like when Truffaut saw Citizen Kane
* This movie is refreshingly itself
* I'm enjoying delicious soups, broths, and coffees
* her hands are like flypaper and her lips are like wine
* sorry boss, i killed that horse again
* its amazing how one senate meeting can wipe out organized crime
