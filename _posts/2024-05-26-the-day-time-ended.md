**Rating:** 2.5/5

TV's son of TV's frankfurter 

Woah, Dr. Laurence Erhardt returned! I legitimately forgot about him.

This movie is okay — more boring than broken

The little animated alien is nightmare fuel — I love him. Why are there so many different aliens?

* Don't talk to the lovecraftian obelisk, dear!
* — Grandpa! — Not now, telephone 
* Every part of the cow
* The afterglow of elder love cools in the desert mist
* — This doesn't make any sense! — It's a Charles Band movie, what did you expect?
* Come, sweet death
* Crap, I think that thing imprinted on me
* At least give the horse a weapon, jeez!
