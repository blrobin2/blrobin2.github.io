**Rating:** 4.5/5

To have the confidence of Florence Bates and assume everyone is in love with me until proven otherwise. Taking medicine she yells, “wretched stuff, give me a chocolate quick!”

Lawrence Olivier wrote the book on negging. “Eat it up like a good girl.” 😳

Joan Fontaine plays insecure fawning so expertly, and she has such a modern acting style — minus the transatlantic accent — she almost feels like she doesn’t belong in the time period

Great miniatures, beautiful backdrops, and love how the gothic shadows begin almost immediately but subtly grow and creep over the movie

This might be my favorite Hitchcock
