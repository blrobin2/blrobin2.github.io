I realized a few months ago that I saw the Friedkin remake, not the original. Today is as good a day as any to fix that

When I tell you this film hit me in the heart — I was crying by the end  — just a perfect script, and so many great performances

#### Stray Thoughts

- I love getting to see the original Ed Begley acting about, even if its ugly racist tirades
- EG Marshall sweats on queue like Christian Bale
- I love Jack Klugman in this, and I can't pinpoint why
- I don't love henry fonda in this — his acting style feels insincere at times
- I wish folks took reasonable doubt this seriously
- why'd they ask this director to do <i>The Wiz</i>??
