We cold-open to a disembodied, mutated hand grabbing a screwdriver. The radio plays bouncy beach music. A cartoon pow as the screwdriver cuts wires.

A woman tans on the pier, listening to a story about a recent murder.

The humanoid creature leaves a glowing residue on a passing tree.

We jump cut to the creature swimming under the water. It drags the woman underwater. She struggles to escape but cannot.

The creature is a man in scuba gear with some colored cords and additional fabric attached to suggest a jellyfish-like creature.

Cut to the primary cast â€” some women visiting one of them's fathers, Dr. Richardson. The doctor and his assistant, Dr. Hoyt, study man o' wars.

Their assistant, Egon, lurks around, his minor facial scars scaring everyone he encounters.

The police find a deformed body. Marks resembling man o' war jellyfish burns cover the body. The doctor feigns ignorance, but Egon seems to know the truth.

This movie features a monumental amount of dancing butt shots as people dance to the hit song we all know and love, "Do the Jellyfish."

I'm conflicted about my rating. On one hand, this is an objectively terrible movie. On the other, it is entertaining, often at its own expense.

I'm landing on this movie being so bad it's good.
