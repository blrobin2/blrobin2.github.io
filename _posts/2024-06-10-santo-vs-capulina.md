Capulina is a nightwatchman for a postal warehouse for unclaimed packages. His boss chastises him for falling asleep on the job, and Capulina promises he would never do that.

So, when he puts on his pajamas and falls asleep on the job, a gang of thieves arrive to steal some ceramic figures. Santo shows up to stop them. Capulina wakes up and tries to help Santo but accidentally captures Santo, allowing the thieves to escape.

After some investigation, Santo learns the ceramics contain diamonds and are part of a diamond trafficking ring. To redeem himself, Capulina will pose as Santo to stop the gang. Through this, he learns that the gang is also making robot clones, including one of Capulina. Thus, Santo vs. Capulina.

For the right fan, this was a major crossover event. Capulina starred in numerous comedies as an oaf getting in over his head but succeeding in the end. Santo is, of course, the most famous luchador of all time.

These fight scenes are rough â€” no choreography and they feel endless.

The soundtrack is so aggressively kitschy that it's grating. The score has one theme and plays it over and over.

Santo taking off his mask and having another mask on is pretty funny

It's not a total train wreck, but it's still a rough watch.
