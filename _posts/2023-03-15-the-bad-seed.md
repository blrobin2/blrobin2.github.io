**Rating:** 4.5/5

Our introduction to the family has major <i>Leave It to Beaver</i> vibes — wholesome and unassuming. “By gum, I’ll try!” Gee whiz

But the music has an ominous undercurrent as Rhoda —played by Patty McCormack — turns in brief moments to anger that seem to come and go on whims, and the weirdness of the much older gardener who taunts Rhoda like a schoolboy

Once one of Rhoda’s schoolmates drowns and Rhode seems completely unfazed by it — “Why should I feel sorry? It was Claude D’aigle who got drowned, not me” — we know something is off with this kid

The remainder of the movie is us questioning, along with the mother — played by Nancy Kelly —as to whether or not Rhoda is capable of killing Claude. Much of the discussion revolves around nature vs nurture, whether sociopathy is genetic, and whether the mother is in fact adopted and that what is wrong with Rhoda came from her

Nancy Kelly is fantastic as the anxious mother who can’t figure out her child

Patty McCormack has a lot to do as a child actor, and while she may not pull it off by today’s standards, she holds her weight with the other actors in the film

This movie fucked me up! It doesn’t hold punches, and it doesn’t relent

<b>Stray thoughts:
</b>* Love the ominous opening of the storm over the lake, then the turn to the city just off in the distance
* The scenes with Claude’s mother are devastating, she’s so lost and heartbroken
* The credits are voiced and the actors step out, like it’s a stage play. I guess to show that the actors actually like each other
* Another movie with a card at the end asking people not to spoil it! Very neat
