**Rating:** 3.5/5

Now, THIS is a VIBE. Sexy people in Michael Mann lighting being shot with a flip phone or something

I’m convinced the resurgence of the mullet and mustache is due to Colin Ferrell in this movie

Does Justin Thoreaux have more than 1-2 lines? He’s just, like, hanging out. I love it

This is plotted like an episode of tv in the middle of the second season — it gives no shits about you knowing anyone or anything

Sex to Audioslave is funny. This whole soundtrack is so doofy
