Watching for a podcast

<blockquote><i>Do you think god will forgive us for what we've done?</i></blockquote>Creasy (Denzel Washington), a "drunk, washed-up has-been" and former CIA agent, takes an offer to be a bodyguard for 10-year-old Pita (Dakota Fanning) from old friend Paul (Christopher Walken)

<blockquote><i>Do you ever see god's hand in the work you do?</i></blockquote>During Creasy's time with Pita, he rediscovers his will to live. One day, however, several men shoot down Creasy and kidnap Pita. And so, to gain redemption in the eyes of god, he sets out to do whatever it takes to get her or get revenge

<blockquote><i>Forgiveness is between them and god. It's my job to arrange the meeting</i></blockquote>I've come to enjoy Tony Scott's hyper-stylized nonsense — blending it with Paul Cameron's cinematography, however, is headache-inducing. Additionally, some of the imagery looks janky in 2023

That said, how many revenge movies try to pull off the balance of emotions and brutality? Few have the patience of Tony Scott to spend time developing the characters, giving the audience the requisite genre signposts so that neither languish in the story

Denzelwitu Washington is the perfect casting choice — few actors can read as parental and vindictive

I didn't go into this with high hopes, but I ended up enjoying this more than I expected

#### Stray Thoughts

- St. Jude, Patron Saint of Lost Causes — sick burn, Pita
- I hope Dakota Fanning is in therapy
- Shooting a shotgun in the air at a rave seems dangerous
- The bomb in the guy's ass takes the movie to exploitation territory — you strapped him to a car — you couldn't put the bomb in the car?
