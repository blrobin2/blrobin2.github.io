**Rating:** 2/5

* Say a prayer for your daddy tonight. You hear me? A good, wholesome prayer, son. None of that weird stuff you're into.
* Can I file taxes as your dependent?
* Mom! Dad! It's nighttime in the backyard again!
* Daniel! My favorite Elton John song is Daniel!
* Cherish the old rugged cross, babe.
* Woah, wait. What's a killer pumpkin doing in this movie about a dad planning his haunted garage?
* He never said that prayer, so Daddy went to hell.
