- Say a prayer for your daddy tonight. You hear me? A good, wholesome prayer, son. None of that weird stuff you're into.
- Can I file taxes as your dependent?
- Mom! Dad! It's nighttime in the backyard again!
- Daniel! My favorite Elton John song is Daniel!
- Cherish the old rugged cross, babe.
- Woah, wait. What's a killer pumpkin doing in this movie about a dad planning his haunted garage?
- He never said that prayer, so Daddy went to hell.
