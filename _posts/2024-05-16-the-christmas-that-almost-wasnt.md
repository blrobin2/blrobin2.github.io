**Rating:** 2/5

Always nice to see Pearl and Elliott Kalan, however briefly.

The villain looks like Dustin Hoffman in <i>Hook</i>. Obviously, this movie was an influence.

This movie isn't horrible, but it would have made me cry as a child. Riffing on a movie that is trying to be funny is a losing battle.

* That dog is barking for his agent
* I can't believe this is in the Bible
* — You know something, mister? — Uh, no
* I think I know what happens next. I've seen <i>The Wicker Man</i>
* — Why can't every day be gay? — That's a loaded question
* Not so fast, you big baby. I mean, not so fast, my widdle baby.
