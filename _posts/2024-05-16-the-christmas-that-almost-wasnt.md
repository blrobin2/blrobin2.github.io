Always nice to see Pearl and Elliott Kalan, however briefly.

The villain looks like Dustin Hoffman in <i>Hook</i>. Obviously, this movie was an influence.

This movie isn't horrible, but it would have made me cry as a child. Riffing on a movie that is trying to be funny is a losing battle.

- That dog is barking for his agent
- I can't believe this is in the Bible
- — You know something, mister? — Uh, no
- I think I know what happens next. I've seen <i>The Wicker Man</i>
- — Why can't every day be gay? — That's a loaded question
- Not so fast, you big baby. I mean, not so fast, my widdle baby.
