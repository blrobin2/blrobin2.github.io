<blockquote><i>New York City, 1984. Crime is at an all-time high. Gangs of drugged-out punks roam the streets, preying on the innocent. A rash of kidnappings involving young women has gripped the city with fear… The citizens of New York are fed up. The city needs hope. The city needs… <b>a hero</b>.</i></blockquote>

When a street gang kills his pregnant wife, John becomes the hero the city needs — a vigilante ninja. But is he prepared for the outrageous antics of the Plutonium Killer?

Actor/director John Lius started making this movie back in 1984. Their budget was slim — a mere $100 for special effects, which all went towards the Plutonium Killer's scenes. Then, before they could finish filming, the production studio shut down.

The footage lived on the shelves until a few years ago, when Vinegar Syndrome rediscovered the footage and worked on putting together a complete movie. While they did not film any additional footage, they hired Voyag3r to do the score and several B-movie A-listers, such as Cynthia Rothrock and Linnea Quigley, to dub the lines.

The result is remarkable for what it is. The key phrase is "for what it is." Though innately goofy, the original filmmakers seemed earnest. Vinegar Syndrome matched that earnestness, giving this movie a heart that elevates the material.

It would never have been a great movie and may have stayed forgotten if finished in 1984. Today, the market for "so bad it's good" movies is only growing.

I'd love an "I ❤️ NY Ninja" shirt (*cough cough* birthday hint *cough cough*).
