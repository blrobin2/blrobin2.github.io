**Rating:** 2.5/5

Colin Farrell, a very handsome boy done dirty by 2002, talks on the phone with Schumacher fav Kiefer Sutherland, a man with a voice, in Diet <i>Saw</i>

<b>stray thoughts</b>
* ah yes, Times Square, the hippest neighborhood in NYC
* the purest "what if phones but too much" movie
* I love how much screenwriters hate publicists
* I have to see the stage play adaptation â€”that sounds boring as hell
* Josh Pais is hilariously miscast
* star 69, hell yeah
* woah NetZero, I forgot all about that
* DJ Shadow in the end credits! nice
