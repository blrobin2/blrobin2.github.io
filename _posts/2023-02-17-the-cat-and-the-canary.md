Amazing compositions and cinematography, deep shadows of German Expressionism, old mansion with secrets — this is my shit. The humor is… you know, a century old, so amusing at best, but still has good timing and whatnot. The title cards are often playful and enhance the readings

It only stops looking great when they try to fit too many people in the frame and they just don’t have any creative ways to fit them, so it has that stereotypical silent movie flatness, but those are rare

Overall, fun and easy watch!
