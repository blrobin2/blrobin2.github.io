Lori and Alex go apartment hunting in NYC. He's had it with dorm life and wants some privacy. They finally find one—though small, the place is clean, the windows open, and it's close to Lori's place. Alex's friend, Jerry, helps him move in, assuring him that the privacy will be perfect for picking up babes. But Alex doesn't think there are any "babes" in this building. That is, until Nichole strolls out, looking fresh out of an 80s music video.

One night, Alex hears Nichole and some punk having sex next door. He hears someone scream, followed by Nichole going down to the dumpster. The next day, the punk runs into Alex and invites him over for "nourishment." They drink a green-ish "wine" from before any of them were born and a bowl of green "Himalayan yogurt."

When he awakens the next day, he discovers his body emits a yellow-orange slime. He also finds himself in a violent rage. And when he satisfies that rage by killing an unhoused person, he finds it calms the slime. And yet, he still has an insatiable hunger for the "Himalayan yogurt." Or is it???

This movie's dedication to bizarre practical effects took it over the hump for me. Though mostly slime-based body horror, the murders can also get quite grotesque. The movie is pretty cheap, though, which makes the effects all the more entertaining.

#### Stray Thoughts / Spoilers

- Mary Hunter plays both Lori and Nicole. You know, the Madonna and the whore and whatnot.
- — "I love what I see here," Lori awkwardly says regarding Alex's drawing. — "I do too," Alex replies, referring to Lori.
- Nichole's apartment looks like one you'd find in Fallout.
- "Does your lover live in an old apartment building?" [cue sinister music]
- The score kind of slaps when it's the manic saxophones!
- This finale is perhaps the silliest, slimiest horror movie ending I've seen. The effects are cheap, but so fun!
- — "Are you interested in the apartment, Mr. O'Bannon?" — "Please, call me Irish." I had to look it up. Yes, it's his first name. Irish O'Bannon.
