<blockquote><i>Why is it that the unknown always frightens people? Why can't we expect love and friendship instead of death?</i></blockquote>

A rocket flies through deep space, hundreds of thousands of miles from Earth, on its way to explore the moon. The astronauts are in an induced sleep state, strapped into their seats. A radio relay comes through, waking them up so they take their positions. Helen rouses from sleep with a strange sense of déjà vu.

Ground control provides astronauts with the opportunity to speak to those at home. They give a little plug to the oil company that got them there.

Helen experiences an unexplainable and powerful sensation and advises the pilot that they land on the dark side of the moon. She seems to know more than she lets on to the others.

<blockquote><i>Alpha, we're on our way.</i></blockquote>

The astronauts traverse the surface of the moon, finding a cave. They notice what appears to be water dripping down its walls. One astronaut lights a match to prove there is oxygen, and so they take off their space suits and helmets.

Helen guides them through the caves. Off in the distance, they see the ruins of an ancient civilization. What they find in the ruins will shock (and arose) them.

It's Cat-Women. They find cat women who intend to seduce them using telepathy so they can get off their dying space rock.

<blockquote><i>You're too smart for me, baby. I like 'em stupid.</i></blockquote>

The movie, while total nonsense, is a pretty fun and fluffy watch. The buildup is more satisfying than when they meet the cat woman. But at an hour, it's hard to get too bored.

This film pioneered the popular "[women] of the [place]" formula. Somehow, this is one of the most influential sci-fi films ever made.
