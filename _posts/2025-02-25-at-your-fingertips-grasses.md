**Rating:** /5

This short is like one of those 5-minute craft videos, but it's all about grass.

* How can you remember some of the beautiful shapes of the grasses you find? One way is to press them into soft clay or plasticine. Better yet, transplant an entire acre of grass into your basement.
* Damn it, is grass corn or not? Come on!
* Nothing says, "I forgot it was Father's Day," like a grass rubbing.
