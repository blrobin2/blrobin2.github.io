<blockquote><i>God, if you exist, help us</i></blockquote>

Father Percival comes to the Reverend Father to ask for the weekend off to see his family for a reunion. His two aunts are so pious that even the Vatican knows them. Or maybe it’s that they're rich and quite old. So, because what Father Percival asks is against the rules, the Reverend Father insists he must get some of that sweet cash for the church.

The family gathers in West Flanders, Belgium. And it turns out everyone who attends is there for money. One nephew doesn’t attend, as he’s a devil-worshiper and not invited.

<b>THIRTY MINUTES LATER</b>, someone shows up at the gate with a present for the aunties. They open the box to find an engraved box. When the aunties open it, its contents sneak into their champagne glasses. The drink turns them into horrifying monsters.

The effects are the selling point. They’re cheap, but they’re creative, especially towards ther end. Otherwise, this movie is boring as hell. Huge bummer!
