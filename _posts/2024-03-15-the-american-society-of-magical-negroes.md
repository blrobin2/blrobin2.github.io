**Rating:** 2/5

Was <i>Sorry to Bother You</i> too confrontational? Did <i>Dear White People</i> still make you feel guilty? Was <i>American Fiction</i>'s dated critique too pointed?Â 

Here's a toothless movie about white fragility that doesn't functionally critique the respectability politics it lampoons. But don't worry, we get a speech near the end that amounts to, "Did you know Black Lives Matter?"

Here's what I liked: the movie had some funny jokes, Justice Smith and An-Li Bogan had moments of palpable on-screen chemistry, and I'm always happy to see Drew Tarver or Michaela Watkins.

Still, the thread was not enough to hold up the messy yarn sculpture that is this movie.
