**Rating:** 3.5/5

Lizzy is a ceramic sculptor and illustrator. She has a show coming up. She's trying to get everything ready, but nothing goes right.

Her landlord/fellow artist, Jo, has not fixed the hot water, leaving Lizzy unable to take showers. Jo has TWO shows coming up, so she hasn't had time.

When her cat attacks a pigeon, Lizzy lets it out, only for Jo to find it and nurse it back to health. With limited time, Lizzy takes charge. Lizzy took the day off to work. She ended up taking the pigeon to the vet.

The film captures everyday situations and experiences. In the grand scheme, minor events. The mundane details can still easily consume our attention.

The most apparent theme is embracing the present and releasing attachments. You can't control when your hot water is off. When the kiln overheats, it can burn a sculpture's side. Busy people may not have time to answer the call.

I imagine a rewatch would add some nuance to that take.

Michelle Williams is in her character. I forgot I was watching Michelle Williams.

This movie is delightful and slight. It didn't hit me, but it was confident and trusting of its audience.
