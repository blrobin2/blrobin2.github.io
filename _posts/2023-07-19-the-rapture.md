Sharon (Mimi Rogers) is a telephone operator by day and a swinger by night, seeking sexual encounters with her friend Vic (Patrick Bauchau)

With one of her recurring hookups Randy (David Duchovny with a mullet, why does this work for me?), they converse about meaning and morality

In all of it, she seeks connection and yet feels disconnected and empty

But through a series of encounters — coworkers whispering about the Rapture, a woman with a back tattoo of god handing down a Pearl, and a mysterious prophet referred to as the Boy — she finds herself born again in an end-of-the-world Christian cult

And that’s when stuff starts getting nuts

The movie makes several choices, never staying in one place too long, but follows Sharon through her spiritual journey of belief and doubt to a disturbing but logical conclusion

Some conversations go in circles because there aren’t many minor religious details, just “the Pearl,” “the Boy,” and salvation before the end of days, but it’s not a big issue

This movie is out of control, and I love it. Being the director’s first film is wild — it has so much confidence in its choices
