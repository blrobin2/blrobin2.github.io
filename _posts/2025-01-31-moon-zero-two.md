**Rating:** 2.5/5

According to the episode guide, no one remembered doing this episode when asked ~six seasons later. Why do I have such a soft spot for Hammer, even when it kind of sucks?

* Hide the garnishes! All the knick-knacks have to move!
* Let's use our precious oxygen and bury him
* Timpani gun, works every time
* What good is them being on the moon if they just reenact the atrocities of Earth?
* I bet he won't try that again
