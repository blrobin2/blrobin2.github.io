Delos has developed the vacation of the future — a set of themed worlds that create immersive experiences with the aid of near-human-looking robots.

<blockquote><i>There's no way to get hurt here, so enjoy yourself</i></blockquote>

But the scientists at Delos have discovered an alarming rate of breakdowns, following a pattern akin to the spread of an infection.

No one worries too much until one of the robots goes against its programming and hurts a human.

Similar to Jurassic Park, this movie takes an eye thought up by an eight-year-old and tries to make it work. Inevitably, it involves experiences only available to the rich, warnings from brilliant but ignored scientists, and chases when things go wrong.

Don't get me wrong, I still found this entertaining. It's just one of those concepts that falls apart with any scrutiny

#### Stray Thoughts

- The glow in the robot's eyes — is that when it wants to fight its protocol?
- fun seeing assembly routines on the screen
- Heaven forbid a guest get up to go to the bathroom or grab a glass of water in the middle of the night
- Dying at the guy's wife slobbering over the idea of lax moral orgies
- pixelated robot vision is cool
- big backrooms energy in the underground
