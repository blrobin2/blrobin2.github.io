**Rating:** 1.5/5

* just advancing the plot, nothing personal
* i know what you're thinking â€” did i fire one shot, or only one?
* uh jeb, you got a real dark side
* you ever feel like crying and you dont know why?
* there's a madman across the water there
* looks like the cave of Dr Calamari
* i don't remember Liz being dead with giant hickeys on her neck
* i used 100 sticks of 40%, enough to kill all of us
