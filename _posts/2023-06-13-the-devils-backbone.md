**Rating:** 3/5

Cool practical effects, meh CG effects, long, fairly predictable, well constructed from a script standpoint, it’s not gonna stick with me

<b>Stray Thoughts/Spoilers:</b>
* These poor kids and their horrendous haircuts
* I’ve heard of a worm in the mezcal but a fetus in the rum?
* Santi’s design is pretty cool — I like the steam of blood
* Have to go through all the new kid tropes (including the bully/reluctant friend), all the “misunderstanding the ghost” tropes
* I don’t know why Concinta is with a cartoonishly evil dude — I mean, had to be a small dating pool at the school
* Chekov’s wooden leg
