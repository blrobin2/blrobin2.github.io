**Rating:** 4/5

“I sometimes wish I were ordinary like you. Ordinary and dead. Ordinary and dead like all the others”

Surprised by how good this is — I don’t know what I was expecting — but it’s suspenseful, tense, even thrilling at moments. Really smart, economic cinematography, good performances all around, perfect movie for a cozy rainy day
