<blockquote><i>On down through the ages, Gospel was good news. Now if you don't know that, I will throw you outta here myself.</i> — Rev. Thomas Dorsey, the Godfather of Gospel</blockquote>

<blockquote><i>I feel like I can fly away. I forget I'm in the world sometimes, I just wanna take off.</i> — Mother Willa Mae Ford Smith</blockquote>

<blockquote><i>You oughta look into Gospel music; those cats are neat.</i> — Ry Cooder, encouraging George Nierenberg to make this movie</blockquote>

A documentary focusing on the history of Black gospel music told through the genre's pioneers — Reverend Thomas Dorsey and Mother Willa Mae Ford Smith.

Thomas Dorsey is the person who took the old hymns and spirituals and pepped them up, releasing them under the name "Gospel." He organized the conventions that helped it spread worldwide. His interfaith, nondenominational approach made Gospel music a unifying, uplifting force. Until his dying day, he toured the world to teach choirs the gospel style.

Both he and Willa Mae Ford Smith had Blues backgrounds. Dorsey found Sallie Martin and Willa Mae, hiring them to go around singing his Gospel songs and selling them to the church after the service.

Willa Mae took over the gospel soloist part of the convention for Dorsey. She brought up all the standout gospel singers up through the 1980s.

This is what documentary does best — it preserves history, gives it a story to pass down, and keeps it alive.

But a story requires omission and manipulation. Nierenberg did so by setting up scenes and pushing folks to talk about contentious subjects. It's the practice at the heart of reality television. Still, this has truth at the heart of it that outshines the petty drama.

"Jesus Dropped the Charges" is too catchy!
