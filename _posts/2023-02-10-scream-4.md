**Rating:** 4/5

Lucy Hale! Alison Brie! Nico Tortorella! Folks from my comfy TV, I’m already here for it

I love how much the opening rags on Scream 3, I guess because Kevin Williamson is back?

Courtney Cox, girl, don’t try to write a book on Microsoft Word

The only <i>Fight Club</i> homage I will respect

What a comeback, wow, truly sets the standard for horror movie remakes that can’t shut up about the original
