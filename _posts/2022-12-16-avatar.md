It’s impossible for me to see this in 2009 eyes — and I understand that this is a me problem and not a movie problem

I’ve tolerated an onslaught of CGI movies that have come out since this, and technical achievement in filmmaking isn’t going to do it for me anymore; I just feel like I’m watching an extended cutscene in a video game I don’t want to play

That said, I do think Marvel and other CG-heavy filmmakers could learn a lot from this movie about visual storytelling. The final fight sequence could have been a huge mess, but it was easy to know where everyone was and how they were moving through space — a weird complement, but a rare feat in movies like this
