**Rating:** 1.5/5

I like the idea of the gauntlet! I would love to program my own gauntlet — perhaps the six lowest rated movies on my watchlist?

I've seen this movie too many times.

* I will remove this panel, secure in the knowledge there are no aliens behind it — oh my god!
* What are those? Kids?
* Pretty nice!
* I'm sure there's a logical explanation, probably a horrifying one
* You know they got Terrence Mallick to shoot that shot? That's why it goes nowhere 
* Dead
* Don't need that tooth
* Have mercy
* This is too hard, just flush him
* Petty nice us all, every one
