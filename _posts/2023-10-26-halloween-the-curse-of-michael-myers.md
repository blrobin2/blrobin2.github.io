**Rating:** 2/5

Six years ago, Michael and his niece Jamie disappeared on Halloween. Some thought they died, but others thought a secret group protected them.

Now, Jamie has given birth, and this group wants Jamie's baby for their own purposes. For whatever reason, Michael kills everyone in the group. Jamie escapes with her child, but Michael catches up, killing Jamie but unable to find the baby.

Tommy Doyle (baby Paul Rudd) returns from the first movie as one of the few who has experienced and survived Michael. He finds Jamie's baby and everyone finds each other, including Dr. Loomis (poor Donald Pleasance in his last role).

Loomis explains that someone cursed Michael (see Curse Lore below if you care) and that Michael cannot stop until his whole bloodline is dead. The group wants to mark the baby with the same curse as Michael to spread his power.

The druid shit is amusing, even if makes little sense. No one is doing a good job in this slow and boring movie. It's at least more entertaining than the previous entry, but not by much.

I've heard about the Producer's Cut and how it puts more of the curse details together, but I don't care enough to seek it out. Classic Weinstein fuckery.

I only watched this to complete the original movies.

<b>CURSE LORE</b>

The Curse of Thorn is a runic symbol based on the constellation Thorn, appearing during Samhain (the druidic precursor to Halloween). To prevent plagues and curses from affecting the entire tribe, one family would bear the curse. The curse drives the bearer to kill their entire family, granting them inhuman strength and immunity from death. They placed the curse on the family's child, making them pure evil.

Why does Michael kill others if the cursed child is only supposed to kill his family? Maybe itâ€™s anyone who stands in his way, but it ends up being anyone he encounters. Sort of defeats the purpose of cursing only one family to preserve the others.
