Micro-budget horror movies tend to gain attention by making up the budget with extreme violence or fucked up subject matter — this isn’t the first I’ve seen with a castration scene

The movie attempts to enter a headspace similar to Lynch or Jodorowsky, where dream and reality merge, and answers are left up to the viewer. One crucial piece this lacks that Lynch’s work contains is empathy for the suffering individuals portrayed. It feels like the extreme imagery predominantly comes from a “wouldn’t this be fucked up?” approach

That isn’t to say that the film is unmotivated. At the core is a wound left by a mother abandoning their child, and in a mirror, the loss of a child during childbirth — mother and child pass DNA to one another, and both are bound to one another — where one ends, the other begins

One of the better-explored ideas is Susan’s (Kate O’Rourke) perceived constant watch by surveillance cameras, both hidden in every room in her house and present during every human encounter

Overall, I don’t think all of the psychosexual imagery works in this movie, but it definitely has ideas, and I’ll probably be thinking about it for a bit
