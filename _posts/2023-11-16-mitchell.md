**Rating:** 2/5

Last Joel episode! Mike finally stops playing a bit in nearly every episode since the beginning and takes over as host. After years of claiming to be a Mike fan, I've come to love Joel's groan-worthy jokes. We'll see how Mike fares, but as of this episode call me a both fan

I worked with a guy who used to watch this episode on tape every night before going to bed. He did this for years — he could still be doing it if that tape has survived

* Hey look, es-SEX film!
* We've hidden Mitchell somewhere in this picture
* Cedar lattice — works every time 
* Mitchell, honey, we're home, put your shoes on
* Man, he's good
* They're traveling at speeds up to 25 mph
* I'm all done!
* Mitchell!
* Oh, vaudeville
* He refrigerates his bowling bag?
*  I'll never grow old, I'll never die, and I'll always eat oatmeal
* That's our Mitchell!
