I feel like I'm missing something.

The songs — forgettable, including the most famous song from the show, "That's Entertainment."

The plot is incoherent and fractured, especially after the Faustian show bombs.

Fred Astaire is incapable of chemistry with any living woman, especially with Cyd Charisse, who hates his guts.

The dancing is incredible, and they pull off some memorable stuff there. But there are also some cursed numbers — the triplets dancing will be in my nightmares.

I feel like I watched a spoof on something I haven't seen. Did I?

I had to watch "No Dames" from <i>Hail, Caesar</i> as a palette cleanser.
