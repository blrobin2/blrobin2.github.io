**Rating:** /5

I was hoping for something that had relevance to the USA's current circumstances, or rather, something that I could show my conservative father, who is pro-Trump, that might hint at the similarities. But this is propaganda, not education, content in saying, "Look at these morons," and leaving it at that. At the time it came out, such a shake-up might have been helpful. Today, when everyone thinks everyone they disagree with is a nazi, this short would likely only further entrench folks in their respective echo chambers.
