Twenty-seven years after the first movie's events, we jump to assholes harassing some gay boys at a carnival. After the boys think they have escaped, Pennywise kills one of them.

Mike calls the gang one by one. They've forgotten everything, including Derry.

They meet and remember. Mike gives them fetch quests for artifacts from their past. Through a Native American ritual, the combined artifacts can stop Pennywise permanently.

Meanwhile, Pennywise kills more kids.

Then comes a trillion-year showdown.

Facing Pennywise is all about belief. Being unafraid of him keeps you safe. You can hurt him if you believe you can hurt him. Well, until the movie changes its mind. The move might end in under two hours otherwise.

What the fuck is this? I assumed this wouldn't be good, but I couldn't imagine.

Bill Skarsg√•rd is an incredible Pennywise. Otherwise, nothing here is worthwhile.

Wait, a guard watches a video of a cute dog in sunglasses. It also has that going for it.
