**Rating:** 4/5

I didn’t care about the Lenny Bruce surrogate movie, and it went on for sooo long, and it kept coming back. I know why, it makes sense in the movie, it was just tedious

The finance guy furious that all of the extra editing and time actually made the movie better is pretty funny

I appreciate the more fantasy-oriented internal dialogs / bargains with death or whatever. If Jessica Lange were the angel of death, I wouldn’t bargain for my life, absolutely iconic in this

John Lithgow spotting! Wallace Shawn spotting!

I really like the <i>8½</i> - like hallucinatory surrealist music numbers in the hospital. I feel like that’s when the movie actually starts getting good. The rest is solid, it just needed to get weird
