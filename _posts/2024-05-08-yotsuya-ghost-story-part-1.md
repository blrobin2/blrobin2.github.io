Kohei and Naosuke did a stint in prison together. During a jailbreak, they both stayed behind. The film implies that Naosuke ratted out the jailbreakers for a plea bargain.

Later, on the outside, an old friend of Kohei, Yomoshichi, recognizes Kohei and invites him to his home. Kohei confides in Yomoshichi, telling Yomoshichi that he needs to find a woman he loves from before his time in prison.

Osode, Yomoshichi's wife, returns, and Kohei calls her Oiwa, the woman he has been seeking. But Osode confirms she is Oiwa's twin sister. She tells Kohei that Oiwa lives in Yotsuya and that she is married to a samurai named Iemon Tamiya.

We cut to Tamiya, fighting off a group of ruffians and protecting Ouma, the young daughter of a rice merchant. A man informs Tamiya that his wife, Oiwa, suffered a miscarriage from a fall.

Tamiya reminisces over his courtship with and marriage to Oiwa. He resents his marriage and the poverty they face. Without a master, he has no consistent income.

Osode tells Oiwa that Kohei is looking for her. Oiwa considers him merely a customer from her past teahouse job. Osode warns her that Kohei may snoop around, but Oiwa is faithful to her husband.

Meanwhile, Naosuke plans for Ouma and Tamiya to meet. He hides his desire for Tamiya and Ouma's marriage to benefit Tamiya and gain a share for himself. Despite his initial doubts, Tamiya takes him up on the offer. 

Thus, the pieces are in place. The film follows the familiar trajectory of a Kaidan. Part 1 shows the miserable person making a selfish choice for personal gain.

Kinuyo Tanaka's performance, as both Osode and Oiwa, is outstanding. My heart breaks for Oiwa. Tamiya acts like his choice is for her benefit — that she'll be happy again without him. And she might. Her attachment to Tamiya prevents her from ending their relationship. She has no family outside of him and her sister.

After Tamiya suggests divorce, Oiwa wears makeup and a kimono around the house. She hides her feelings and works harder than before.

I once broke up with a long-term partner to be with someone else, and the pain I caused them is a guilt I still carry. It isn't the same situation, but Oiwa's desperation is too real.

Tamiya isn't heartless. When he realizes how painful a divorce would be for Oiwa, he wants to back out. But Naosuke cares too much about his plan to let Tamiya ruin it.

The music swells are strangely reminiscent of <i>Mulholland Dr.</i>, which affected my emotional response.
