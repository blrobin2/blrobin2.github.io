In the previous movie, the Strodes trapped Michael in a burning house. But alas, Haddonfield doesn't let houses burn down â€” they send out a fire department who accidentally set Michael free. And so, we watch Michael brutally murder a bunch of people in sequence.

But Tommy Doyle and a cadre of townspeople hear Michael is on the street. They're bringing frontier justice to Haddonfield.

Reference after reference after reference! And then almost pornographic kills. The tonal dissonance is way too much. This movie has no idea what it is.

They spend a trillion hours trying to understand who Michael is, but he isn't anything.

Wow, this sucks ass.
