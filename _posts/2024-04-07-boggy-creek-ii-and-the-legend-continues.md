**Rating:** 2/5

This movie has some of the funniest slow zooms.

* It's okay — deer spontaneously regenerate bodies
* Otis never regained consciousness. He was dead, so it makes sense
* I smell ya! You're wearing Giorgio, aren't ya?
* Don't tell me that stuff! Sing it instead 
* If they're not acting casual, I'll have to kill em
* I think you're crazy! A fun kind of crazy, though
