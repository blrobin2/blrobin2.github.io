This movie has some of the funniest slow zooms.

- It's okay — deer spontaneously regenerate bodies
- Otis never regained consciousness. He was dead, so it makes sense
- I smell ya! You're wearing Giorgio, aren't ya?
- Don't tell me that stuff! Sing it instead
- If they're not acting casual, I'll have to kill em
- I think you're crazy! A fun kind of crazy, though
