Thematically, this fails where so many genre films do: when  the metaphor is whatever it needs to be for a particular scene — whether that be sex, drug addiction, family trauma, homosexuality, etc — so the story is reduced to its most cohesive pieces. In this case, the movie resolves to weirdos on the lam

Good performances from everyone, just not much in the way of emotional impact for me
