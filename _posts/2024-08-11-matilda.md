I forgot how profoundly this movie affected me. As a child who had to learn how to love themselves and be their own best friend, Matilda was the first character I remember identifying with. The idea that life could be a little magical and that love is found, not inherited, never left me.

- Stefan Czapshy's cinematography is essential!

- Trumbull wrote the script for contemporary BDSM
- I still want that entire chocolate cake.
- The most threatening "See you at lunch!"
- "Why are all these women married?!"
- "Best friends don't tell."
- "It's wonderful you feel powerful. Most people don't feel powerful at all."
- Matilda does so much for her dad
- "Chew your food! You're an animal!"
