Jon Hamm channels his inner Bill Murray for his spin on the Fletch character, and while it doesn’t always work, it never takes away from the breezy vibe going throughout the movie

I think the biggest disservice to this movie is the cinematography, which sticks to standard, flat shots and doesn’t support any comedic moments

Still, lots of audible chuckles from me, a solid bit of fun

Three stars
