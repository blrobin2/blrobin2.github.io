12090 AD. A vampire hunter rides on horseback. A woman named Doris approaches him, bearing the kiss of the Noble.

Though Doris' village wishes to put her in a camp, the vampire hunter named D requests they fulfill his contract before taking any action.

D must face off against Count Magus Lee, his servants, and his legion of hilarious monsters.

I watched the 1993 re-dub to English since that's what I could find. I think it made the movie more enjoyable than it might have been. 80s anime had some squeaky voice actors.

I dig the Hammer film Gothic aesthetic. The movie has weirdly chill vibes for how violent it is. I suppose that aligns with Toyoo Ashida's goal of making a film for people who are tired from studying or working hard.
