The film is an inversion of the werewolf legend in which a man turns into the titular character when exposed to too much sun. Because this is 1958, it's because of radioactive isotopes and other pseudo-sci-fi nonsense. So, like, The Incredible Hulk, but the sun instead of anger. Or, wait, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

I like the lizard-inspired monster design! The de-evolution concept surely was an inspiration for the 90s <i>Super Mario Bros.</i> movie. Also, I love the bit where they show a close-up of a tarantula and say, "This used to be a grasshopper." The implications are too subtle and multifaceted for me to comprehend.

Part of this movie's score was used in <i>Night of the Living Dead</i>. Neat!

- â€” Sit down. â€” You're not the boss of my ass!
- You mean a human being could evolve backward through time to become some sort of prehistoric creature, like a Neanderthal or a Flintstone?
- If you're prone to hideous sun demonism, I don't think a convertible is the best choice.
- ðŸŽµ I love you more than boiled eggs, white rice, or even margarine.
- Darwin didn't even scratch the surface, never tried to ride a Galapagos tortoise like a horsey.
- A punch emphasizes my indifference!
- Not the decor!
- I like driving fast â€” it takes your mind off of terrible things, like dying in a horrible crash.
- No, please! Let me lap up that spilled drink!
