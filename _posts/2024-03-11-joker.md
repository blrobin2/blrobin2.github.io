<blockquote><i>Is it just me, or is it getting crazier out there?</i></blockquote>I dreaded watching this so much that I had a nightmare last night.

A few months ago, <a href="https://youtu.be/-ffkn3MPXGs?si=H2zMHX2g-9hNz7lN" rel="nofollow">Jonas Čeika posted a video about this movie</a>. In it, he looks at the opposing views of class between <i>The Dark Knight</i> and <i>Joker</i>. The essay theorizes that <i>Joker</i> better empathizes with working-class struggles and how those circumstances lead people to take up crime and violence in the first place.

Now, having watched the movie, I can say that I mostly agree with the essay's ideas. I don't think Todd Phillips had class consciousness or anything meaningful on his mind when he made this movie.

Still, Jonas Čeika's lens helped me appreciate (or endure) the movie, even if it didn't lead me to like it.

Also, I love Joaquin Phoenix, and I'm happy he won an Academy Award, even if it's for this vacant vanity project.
