**Rating:** 3/5

<i>Fatal Attraction</i> in the 70s, when stalking wasn’t a crime and sex was still theoretically free — Clint Eastwood’s character isn’t trying to hold a nuclear family together, he just wants his sex life on his terms

Jessica Walter is perfectly cast — even when she’s playing it cool, there’s an unnerving tension at play, although that doesn’t last very long. She deserves better source material

The pacing on this is aggravating in its unevenness. Still, it’s a solid first movie from a painfully inconsistent director
