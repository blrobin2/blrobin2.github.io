Emily Rief rushes to the bathroom to take a pregnancy test, her face drenched in dread. The test confirms her fears, but we do not see what that is. Leaving the bathroom, she eyes Maria, the janitor, with disgust.

Emily sees Brian, one of the former kids she taught in her kindergarten class, sitting on the curb. She shows him a surprise she has put together for some friends she is meeting later, as well as the manuscript for her first children's book. The book is about a dog named Little Snow, whose fur the book praises for its whiteness. When the janitor rolls past again, she encourages the boy to chastise the janitor. Brian's mother arrives to see, confused and takes Brian home.

Emily walks down a neighborhood alley. She receives a call from Jeff, an inmate at the County Correctional Facility. She declines the call and puts her phone in her bag. Leslie walks by. They walk together to the church, where they meet Kim, Majorie, and Alice. Emily unveils the surprise she showed Brian earlier—a pie with a swastica carved into it. On the whiteboard, we see the group's name written out: "Daughters for Aryan Unity."

The film follows the group in real time as their meeting continues, and Emily's past comes back to haunt her.

I don't know how valuable this film is. It would be different if white supremacy were the backdrop to the action we see onscreen. Green Room is an excellent example of this. But the film spends SO MUCH of its runtime just listening to these women talk about their disgust with immigrants, feminists, and other ethnic minorities.

I can say the casting is excellent—the white women look and behave like white supremacists, for what it's worth.

The film is yet another single-take gimmick. The filmmakers did multiple one-takes and seamed them together through digital transitions. The feeling that it's a single take helps with the momentum, especially when things escalate in the latter half.

Otherwise, the filmmaking is quite well done. By design, I am supposed to feel disgusted, and I haven't felt this repulsed during a horror movie in ages. So, like, how do I rate this?

I'm still curious to see what Beth de Araújo does. In the meantime, I might check out some of her shorts.
