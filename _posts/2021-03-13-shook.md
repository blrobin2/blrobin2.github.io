**Rating:** 1.5/5

The writing is not very subtle or cohesive. “Everyone online is fake” and all that. It also vilifies mental illness more than anything I’ve seen in a good bit

There’s some inventive integration of what’s on their screen or in the character’s head with the environment, but is not enough to make this worth watching
