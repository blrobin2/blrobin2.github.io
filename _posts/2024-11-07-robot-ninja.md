Went to the bar with some friends to watch the election countdown. It was going... poorly, so Neal and I watched this to distract ourselves.

This movie could be cut to 22 minutes and still have every plot point. The gore is over-the-top, and the soundtrack — all original music I believe — goes pretty hard. But no one is giving a good performance — not even Burt Ward and Linnea Quigley get much to work with.

Still, the movie is entertaining in places, but I would never recommend it to a sentient humanoid.
