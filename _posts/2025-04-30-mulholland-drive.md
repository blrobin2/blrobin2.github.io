This film will always hold a special place in my heart. I came across it in college after checking it out from the college library in my ongoing search for "mindfuck" movies. Seeing movies like <i>Donnie Darko</i>, <i>Perfect Blue</i>, and <i>Adaptation</i> in high school, I wanted movies to challenge my preconceived notions of what a movie should be.

This movie was a lotus blossom blooming in my skull, not just because it was a "mindfuck" but because it contained so much empathy and so much darkness and asked so much of me as an audience member that I felt like I had to ask more of the movies I watched.

It wasn't long until I met a coworker at Papa John's who introduced me to foreign films like <i>Stalker</i> and <i>Seventh Seal</i>. I blame this movie for opening me up to those and the endless hunger for film I've had since.
