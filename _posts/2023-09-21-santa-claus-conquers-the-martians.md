**Rating:** 0.5/5

* Smoking is good for you!
* diarrhea is like a storm raging inside you
* If they cancel Battlestar Galactica, I'll kill myself
* I see Santa Claus! And he's kissing mommy!
* God he's good
* These are like the cheap versions of the Lost in Space sets
* Oscar Wilde 2000
* Mm, child tracks, two, three days old
* What is this, the end of The Shining?
* What's Vietnam?
* Isn't that the Jeopardy theme done in a minor key?
* Santa's gonna cut ya, man. Santa's a blade man, man
* Santa Claus, you're coming with us... to town
* Have you ever seen a grown man cry?
