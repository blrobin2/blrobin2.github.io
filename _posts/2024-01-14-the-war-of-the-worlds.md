<b>***Thoughts/Spoilers***</b>
* This movie's remaster sure looks nice. I love the colors
* Dr. Clayton Forrester! I didn't know <i>MST3K</i> got that name from this story
* That Geiger counter is giving organ-melting readings, and they say, "Maybe we shouldn't let folks near this?"
* Did they introduce an ethnic minority just to have someone to kill off?
* Vaults and magnets? What in the name of <i>Lost</i>?
* The alien periscope is snake-like
* If I saw bisexual-colored smoke on the horizon, I, too, would drive there.
* These aliens destroy everything when they land. But let's not evacuate the town yet.
* Reverend Uncle Matthew's a bit of a dolt.
* I like these special effects! Shooting sparks and smokey lights, folks glowing like an x/ray before vaporizing, and everything on fire.
* The horse stampede looks stunning!
* A giant alien spacecraft has crashed into my house. Let's stay in the house, I guess?
* Quit whispering about how cool the tech is of the thing pursuing you, Dr. Forrester
* After the second act of info-dump, this has become boring and heavy on god
* Let's all hang out and watch an atomic bomb go off. At least the effects are still cool
* And it ends with a miracle??
