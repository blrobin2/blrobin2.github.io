<b><a href="https://boxd.it/pmi12" title="Hooptober X ">Hooptober X </a>| 21/34 | Wes Craven | Decades 6/8 | 90s</b>

Freddy cuts off his hand. CUT! We're on a movie set, and the props department is pumping fake blood and tinkering with animatronic claws. The claws come alive and stab someone in the neck. They walk around like Thing, going stabby stabby

EARTHQUAKE! Heather Langenkamp wakes up with her husband and child and runs to safety

She gets a call from New Line Cinema that Wes Craven is having nightmares again, and he has a new one in mind

While driving home, her husband gets in a bad wreck and dies. When Heather sees the body, he has claw marks down his chest. Not only that, Wes Craven's script is running eerily similar to Heather's life

So much of this movie is about her kid acting weird â€” I feel like filmmakers exhausted the trope before this

The movie doesn't get fun... well, at all. But the closest it gets isn't until the last 20 minutes

So many car phones, the wave of the future

In the end, it's self-justifying, but wasn't worth making, with Wes Craven or otherwise

<b>**_ SPOILERS _**</b>
This Freddy is supposed to be darker and scarier, but besides his clothes and claws, he's the same. His tongue is pretty gross, though
