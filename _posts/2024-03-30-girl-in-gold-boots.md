Sci-Fi enforced an overarching plot on this season in a desperate attempt to draw in viewers. The writers knew that no one watched the episodes in order or remotely close to each other but were at the network's mercy.

This episode did the WW bit circulating on social media with <i>Breaking Bad</i> footage.

Segment four made me laugh so much. Mike sings a folk song at a window as it rains. Crow keeps fading into the frame to tell him the water has caused a fire.

The movie's "continuity problems" were almost entirely the fault of <i>MST3K</i> edits. Almost.
