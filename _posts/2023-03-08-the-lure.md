The movie foregoes structure for aesthetics, so stuff just kind of happens. Also, the music numbers don’t really move the plot or do much to reveal internal motivations that weren’t already pretty obvious

That said, there are some musical choices that I like, and the songs aren’t super long, so at least they don’t bring the movie to a grinding halt

I’m bored as hell with love triangles, but at least this knots up the choices and consequences in it. Or rather, plays more closely to the horrifying original story by Hans Christian Andersen

Looking forward to the American remake starring Mia Goth and Anya Taylor-Joy — just kidding, but it’s believable right?
