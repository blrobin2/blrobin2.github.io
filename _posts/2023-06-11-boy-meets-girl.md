**Rating:** 1/5

A woman brings a man home for a one-night stand, watches some porn, and sedates him. He wakes up tied to a dentist's chair. Why? I don’t know, really

The writers are boys who are scared of women but aren’t sure why, creating a caricature of violence that hates men, but they can’t understand why anyone would, so they make her a serial killer with no discernible motivation

Don’t get me wrong — the guy sucks — killing him isn’t the problem — it’s the “why” that I can’t figure out

We spend most of the movie in one room, and you can see them trying to fill up time and find other ways of filming it, but it gets old so quickly

Each scene has a multi-colored title card. The cards are pretty on the nose and don’t add anything other than a break from the room

If the movie were any good, I’d think about it more, but the film is so tediously shot and poorly conceived or realized

<b>Stray Thoughts</b>
* The cigarette helmet is funny (it forces him to smoke three cigarettes at once, and the movie treats it so ominously)
* Jar of penises? Sure, why not
* Does he recognize slugs and maggots by taste?
* “God is dead. She died broken-hearted by her critics.”
