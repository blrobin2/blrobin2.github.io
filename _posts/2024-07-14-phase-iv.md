**Rating:** 3/5

The film is an odd choice. It's also the funniest episode I've seen from this season thus far. I think switching from Gamera helped those creative juices.

I want to watch this movie without the commentary and in better condition — folks seem to love this, and I didn't get a lot out of the film in this context. The macro photography is excellent, and there sure is a lot of it.

The version I downloaded has local access commercials!

We get several authentic laughs from Joel in the segments — it's adorable.

* — My god, they're enormous! — I think it's because the camera is really close
* Why do these ants groom themselves? They're already pretty shiny
* That wheel's a Ferris wheel to those ants. And this is their amusement park.
* Chex Party Mix... with ants
* I think we're making too big a deal of this ant problem
* They're sending a message! Mars... needs... ants?
