**Rating:** 1.5/5

This is the first time I can remember a movie making me laugh with how boring it is. But it had some goofy special effects that I can't hate.

* Here is one of the tiny men who operate the dials on your stove
* How green was my credits
* I'll explain the joke more at lunch
* [lightning crashes] Stop talking, Johnny Longbone!
* Harris was killed by some kind of thing that killed him
* Ah hell, let's shoot up there and see what happens
