**Rating:** 5/5

Finally saw the restored version that had the original soundtrack and corrected frame rate. Max Schreck’s makeup is so wild. The way the movie uses stop-motion to make Nosferatu move slower and faster at will — and actually cutting out frames — feels like the start of the through line of 00’s J-Horror ghost movement
