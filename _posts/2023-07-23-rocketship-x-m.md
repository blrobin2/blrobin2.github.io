**Rating:** 2/5

I swelled with joy with the new opening, set improvements, and of course TV’s Frank

I love how much they despise Lloyd Bridges

* either this man is dead or my clock has stopped
* They’re coming up through the toilet, I’m positive
* Should we get ready for the boring part now?
* Chauvinist detector just went off! Oh, it’s just the dryer, it’s a little off-kilter
* Well, we stared at it, that ought to fix it
* maybe I’m crazy, but I just saw our ancestors and they were walking erect!
