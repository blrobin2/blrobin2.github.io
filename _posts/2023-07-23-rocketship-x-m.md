I swelled with joy with the new opening, set improvements, and of course TV’s Frank

I love how much they despise Lloyd Bridges

- either this man is dead or my clock has stopped
- They’re coming up through the toilet, I’m positive

- Chauvinist detector just went off! Oh, it’s just the dryer, it’s a little off-kilter
- Well, we stared at it, that ought to fix it
- maybe I’m crazy, but I just saw our ancestors and they were walking erect!
