**Rating:** 1.5/5

* Today's forecast is two boulders mixed with volcanic ash
* Land! It was behind the sail the whole time
* Sir, some of us don't feel fresh
* No one has touched my heart. Everything else, sure
* Ah, war is heck
* All this trouble to be the leader of, like, 20 people
* Colossus parts ferns with his bare hands
* And now the traditional viewing of <i>Berlin Alexanderplatz</i>
* A steel pi√±ata?! That could take hours!
* There can be only 300!
* Kids, no weapons on the waterbed
