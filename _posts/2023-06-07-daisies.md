**Rating:** 4.5/5

Sister rebellion — hair in pigtails, ring of flowers on her head — cake before dinner followed by soup — no longer watching my figure  — stealing drinks, climbing on furniture — open jar of pickles next to the phone — send men off on trains — cut a pickle in half, a sausage and banana into pieces as he pleads for her affection — nihilistic decadence set to a kaleidoscope of color and manic editing techniques
