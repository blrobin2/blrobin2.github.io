<blockquote><i>Even if there were some radiation around here, who gives a shit?</i></blockquote>Welcome to Tromaville, the toxic waste capital of the world!

Central to town is the Tromaville Nuclear Facility — filled with all sorts of radioactive waste and toxic chemicals.

A leak! But the oversight would be fatal for the plant. So they keep quiet and keep open, pushing the toxic waste into the sewers

Tromaville High — waste seeping through the ground, coming through the water pipes. Dewy drinks from the water fountain. He starts foaming at the mouth and out the ears. He jumps out the window, his face and skin melting.

The plant blames microwave ovens for Dewy's death.

The punks get some new weed from the plant. It's NUCLEAR. 

The nerds buy a joint for Chrissy and Warren since they're so stuck up. A group of them smoke it. The mutations 

<blockquote><i>— We should have gone to the Fellini movie
</i><i>— Chrissy, this is a Fellini movie!</i></blockquote>
The Cretins do the worst shit, so watching them get taken out is satisfying.

The Nuke 'Em High theme rules. The rock music only stops for the most over-the-top music stings.

Troma is never subtle or shy when it comes to cartoonish gore. I remember seeing a commercial for this on late night television and it grossing me out.

The special effects are impressive for the low budget! There are a couple of scenes that still gross me out.

They should teach this movie's editing in schools — it's so tight and helps accent every joke. The movie breezes by.

The filmmakers are fully aware of the tropes and clichés they are lampooning.

Unsurprisingly, homophobia and transphobia are rampant, as the movie doesn't want to waste an opportunity to upset or offend.

Don't watch this fucking movie.
