**Rating:** 3.5/5

Watched with Jake Kasdan and Mike White commentary

The script gives so much humanity to even the smallest parts — classic Mike White — and the performances are all so good.  Catherine O’Hara kills me, Leslie Mann kills me, Jack Black kills me, Lily Tomlin kills me, Jane Adams kills me, Harold Ramis kills me… everyone is so funny

Speaking of which, it’s also hilariously nepotistic: directed by Lawrence Kasdan’s son, starring Tom Hank’s son and Sissy Spacek’s daughter

Amazing music queues: from Brian Wilson to Jimmy Eat World, Cake to Crazy Town…. it really works for me

I was an Orange County apologist when it first came out, and I’m so relieved that it still stands out in the torrent of teen comedies that came out around it. It’s not perfect, it’s not even great, but it does exactly what it wanted to do and is so cozy to revisit
