Two teenage nerds accidentally lose their teacher's cadaver. So they sneak into the disease control center and steal a replacement body. How were they to know the replacement was a Cannibalistic Humanoid Underground Dweller?

<blockquote><i>Steve, you have a live-dead guy lying in your bathroom!</i></blockquote>I hate when sequels to bad horror movies add "humor" to the sequel so it seems like they're "in on the joke."

The director shot three versions of each scene — a horror version, a comedy version, and a made-for-TV version — and blended them in the editing room. If I went off vibes, they only used the latter two.

I didn't love the first C.H.U.D. (although it's been long enough that I might like it more now). But at least it had silly horror gore. This is the cleanest zombie movie I've seen.

This movie isn't a total disaster. It has a budget and a crew who know how to assemble it. How funny you find it will depend on how much you like Gerrit Graham's performance as Bud.

Not for me!

#### Stray Thoughts / Spoilers \_\*\*</b>

- Did Robert Vaughn do any unsilly movies in the last 30 years of his career?
- Instead of destroying the C.H.U.D., they spray it with some freezing agent. And they don't show the results!
- The poor frog :(
- "Oh shit, it's Mr. Proctor's dead guy!"
- "What in the wide world of sports is going on here?" — I don't know where I've heard that before, but I say it all the time
- The choreographed zombie walks make me want to die
- Was that leap on wires?
- Okay, the Bunsen burner through the head is cool, although still too clean
- He gives her his heart, literally and non-consensually
- Off to see the world with his zombie poodle
- Wait, when did he become a CHUD??
