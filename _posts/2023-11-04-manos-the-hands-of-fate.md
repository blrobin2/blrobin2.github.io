This is a good episode of MST3K, but this move is the worst film they've done thus far

* Visit beautiful ground zero!
* Manos
* You are the driver. What would you do if this happened to you? Manos
* No, you’ve got it all wrong — love should be musty and hurtful
* Every frame of this movie looks like someone’s last known photograph
* He kind of looks like a chainsaw sculpture
* Torgo, you’re the laziest man on Mars
* You can’t kill me, I quit!
* Oh no, not liturgical dance
* You know, there are certain flaws in this film
* We tampered in god’s domain
