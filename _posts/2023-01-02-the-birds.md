**Rating:** 4/5

Why do people we love suddenly leave us? What do we do with their absence? How do we move on when the grief doesn’t go away, the sting hitting when you least expect it? How do we protect our loved ones from heartache?

The answer? I don’t know. No one knows, not really. We make plans, we choose the people we are vulnerable around, and we hope it doesn’t hurt as much next time. But one thing we do know: we can’t ignore the pain and pretend it isn’t there
