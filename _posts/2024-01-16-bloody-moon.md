Miguel lurks in the shadows of a masked pool party. He takes a mask and pretends to be someone else. A woman takes him to her flat, #13. When she takes off his mask, he grabs a pair of scissors and stabs her to death.

Five years later, after a stint in an institution, Miguel is out and in his sister Manuela's custody.

Miguel is still stalking women. And murders are still happening. Is it Miguel?

This movie is entertaining and dopey — it never takes itself seriously enough to warrant much critique.

This movie is the first Jesús Franco I've seen, and I believe fans consider it a "lesser" work of his. So, I'll be checking out more in the future.

#### Thoughts/Spoilers

- Where did they get the torch to kill that woman?
- A girl brings her knitting to hang out with friends. Time is a flat circle
- Wait! Angela sees Miguel in her house and forgets about it when someone comes to the door??
- Oh no, brother-sister incest :(
- The "Rock Your Baby" song is the worst song I've ever heard
- Like, it's gotta be Alvaro who's killing folks, right?
- Everyone keeps trying to fuck Antonio
- Medusa the snake — who's got Medusa??
- Oh, no — dead snake :(
- How do they not notice Eva's body in the closet??
- "It's a little perverse, but as long as I get to the club on time."
- That kid is moving so slowly, and then it doesn't matter.
- Didn't that kid break in half??
- Let's go down to Disco-Club
- What a waste of beer
- Ooo, could it be Manuela??
- Ohhh shit... but why?
- Oh, money
- Wait, what?
- The shots that weren't remastered are pretty scary when intercut with remastered shots
