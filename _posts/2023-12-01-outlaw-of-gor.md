**Rating:** 1.5/5

This episode won a Peabody Award? It is the first good Mike episode

This is the end of the invention exchange, which is fine by me

Mike's acting portfolio where he's always in a sailor suit is so funny

* We broke through the space-time continuum and passed the savings on to you
* Hey! Did Rick say you could use his sword to kill us?
* He's bludgeoning the sand
* Yes, but is it art?
* Ah, the golden days, before sewers
* (Jack Pallance voice) Now to preheat the oven and grease the pan
* He dislocated his mandible!
* This guy is a professional third wheel
* Smell this, slave. What's it smell like?
* Liturgical dance is really weird, but it brings in the parishioners
* TGI Dieday
* She's got a denim house dress on
* You can't kill me, I quit!
* Look, his eyeball comes right out
* I've come to chew bubblegum and kick ass, and I'm out of ass
