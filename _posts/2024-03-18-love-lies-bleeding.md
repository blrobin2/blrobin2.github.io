<b>New Mexico, 1989</b>
Lou works as a gym manager for a gym her father owns.

Jackie is on her way to a bodybuilding competition in Las Vegas. She's stopping in town to get some funds before heading on. She fucks JJ for a job at a shooting range, also owned by Lou's father.

Lou and Jackie meet at the gym and fall for each other. Lou gives Jackie some leftover steroids to help her in the competition. They fuck, and Jackie stays with Lou.

Jackie learns JJ is Lou's brother-in-law and that he physically abuses Lou's sister, Beth. Lou feels stuck because she wants to protect Beth but doesn't know what to do. Things escalate when JJ puts Beth in the hospital.

Jackie decides to take matters into her own hands.

The film has a sinister magic to it. The comedy and brutal violence come out of nowhere. Reality blurs as Jackie takes more steroids â€” it's unclear how much is her perspective and how much is the bizarre reality the movie establishes.

This movie is so impressive! It takes some bold risks and they all pay off. I don't know if I've ever left a film teary-eyed and nauseous.

I'll be thinking about it for a while.
