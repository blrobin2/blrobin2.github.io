After <i>Cabin Fever</i>, the necrosis fasciitis infects Down Home Water's treatment plant.

They bottle and deliver it to a nearby high school.

It starts small, with kids drinking the bottled water. With the school's water turning rancid, the prom coordinator prepares the prom's party punch with the bottled water.

The movie's theme is "revenge" — when high school girls break up with their boyfriends, they only want revenge. That's the only way our protagonists believe they will have sex.

If you like gross-out humor, there's plenty. All the blood, puke, piss, puss, and cum your vulgar heart desires.

Don't worry. It gets disturbing, too. One particularly rough scene is the disease forcing a pregnant teenager to go into premature labor.

<blockquote><i>You'd have to be practically r_____ not to see that I'm in love with you!</i> — A snippet from one of the many "I'd treat you like a queen, he's an asshole, why aren't you with me?" rants.</blockquote>

Rider Strong appears long enough for a school bus to run him over.

Larry Fendersen shows up to blow up and bleed everywhere — they do not hide the tube shooting blood out of his neck.

Noah Segan can't get a break outside of a Rian Johnson movie.

I don't remember loving <i>Cabin Fever</i>. The only thing this has over it is that this movie is impressively nauseating.
