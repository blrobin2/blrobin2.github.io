Lola wants to take Brent to prom, but Brent has a girlfriend and declines. So, with the help of her doting and incestuous father, she captures him and tortures him

The film looks great — the sets, the colors, the gnarly practical effects. The wordless third act is subtly introduced but effectively executed. The story and character, not so much

Lola’s methods of torture and way of interacting with Brent once he’s in her grasps ranges from child not understanding the effect of violence to pervert with some specific kinks. Add to that the way she tries to seduce her father, and none of it really adds up to a person that seems real

Also, almost every other character is given the “wife waiting at home for her husband to return from war” passivity that makes checking in on them tedious

There’s a B-plot with Brent’s friend Jamie that comes and goes with no real hiccups, and no interaction with the main plot line. It’s clear that the scenes are meant to provide some relief from all the intense torture and dour sadness, but I guess they couldn’t see a way to make it fit

Overall, it’s not a terrible movie, it just doesn’t provide anything substantial to give it any sort of staying power
