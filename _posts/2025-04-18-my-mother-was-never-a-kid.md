**Rating:** /5

Bridget Jones Nelson (Mike's wife) and Mary Jo Pehl riff on this for Mother's Day.

Aside from some continuity problems, this is a pretty solid after-school special. As Mary Jo says during the riffs, it feels like a Twilight Zone episode (kind of). Robert Fuest, of <i>Dr. Phibes</i> and <i>The Devil's Rain</i> fame, directed this??

* Victoria, you don't deserve fractional parts of whole numbers.
* In New York, you can run away from home without your mom having to drive you.
* McGruff says, "Kill your mother!"
* General Patton's Five Tips for a Happy Marriage
* Sooner or later, every young man hears the sound of a defeated woodwind.
* Well, I know for a fact my mother was never a kid. Also, my mom never laughs at my jokes. And I have to be home by nine, even though Mike says I can stay out til 10!
