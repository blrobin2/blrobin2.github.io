<blockquote><i>In nature's scheme of things, there are certain plants which are carnivorous or eating plants. […] There is much still to learn about these fascinating eating plants. […] [A] newcomer, trifidus selectus, [was] brought to earth on the meteorites during <b>The Day of the Triffids</b>.</i></blockquote>

An unprecedented shower of meteorites rains down across the globe. Most burn up from the intense heat before they reach the earth. Bill Masen listens to the radio discuss the phenomenon while lying in a hospital bed, his eyes bandaged, frustrated by his inability to see what's happening. He begs Dr. Soames and his nurse, Miss Jamieson, to remove the bandages, but they deny his request, reminding him they can come off in the morning.

A security guard for a greenhouse makes his rounds while all this is happening. He passes a set of plants that seem to dance in the flashlight's glow. When he turns to face them head-on, they remain still. After he passes, the plants grow at an otherworldly rate. He sits for a tea break. He hears movement but doesn't see anything. The plants unroot themselves, creeping through the greenhouse. By the time the guard notices what is happening, it's too late — the plant slashes his face and pulls him into its body, consuming him. The triffids have arrived.

Bill awakes at nine, desperate to finally get his bandages removed. He calls for Miss Jamieson and Dr. Soames, but no one replies. He stumbles around the hospital room. A scream erupts from down the hall. Bill removes his bandages himself, letting his eyes adjust. He finds the hospital in total disarray a la <i>28 Days Later</i>. A stumbling Dr. Soames runs into Bill, who takes Dr. Soames to his office. The glare of the meteorites the previous night has blinded him and most of the world. Bill is one of the few people left on earth with sight.

How will the world handle this crisis? What can they do to stop the triffids?

The film explores the different mentalities of how to approach a crisis like this. Those with privilege can hide away and wait it out, even if it's only a prolonged wait until death. Bill has the privilege of seeing when few others cannot, so he sees it as his responsibility to help however he can.

The film does a great job of establishing chaos in London. Bill isn't safe in the city as desperate people roam around, fighting each other for a chance to speak to a sighted person. Out in the country fog, the triffids grow and stalk their prey. Regardless, Bill isn't looking for safety—he's looking for answers.

The triffid design is fun. Several folks find them hokey, but I haven't seen monstrous plant designs like this one.

I haven't read the book or seen the canonical 1980s adaptation, so I can't speak to what this movie did right or wrong there. The comparison I made to <i>28 Days Later</i> earlier applies throughout the film — they share several similar story beats.

I can't say this is the most exciting story, but I enjoyed myself.
