I'm skipping <i>Merlin's Shop of Mystical Wonders</i> because someone datamoshed my copy, and I was deeply uncomfortable. I'll review it when I find a better version.

I always forget I've seen this movie until I watch it. This director did additional photography for <i>Lawnmower Man</i>. The rest is history.

- More like John Claude Gosh Darn
- Dustbuster Galactica
- Van Dammit
- He's beating up his memories
