**Rating:** 3/5

In 1987, The Sweet 16 Killer murdered three teens. Now, 35 years later, someone in the same mask kills Jamie's mom, putting the town on edge

Jamie's friend Amelia builds a time machine for the science fair based on her mother's designs. The killer returns to get her, and she hides in the machine, going back to 1987 before the murders took place

So you know that she has to try and stop that killer!

Blame TikTok for showing me a clip from this. Once Julie Bowden started doing fight choreography, I was on board

One of the kids has all of these VHS tapes
* Dune
* Terminator
* Reanimator
* Blade Runner
* Buckaroo Bonzai
* Empire Strikes Back
* Tron
* Innerspace
* Starfighter
* Scanners
* And they're watching Robocop

I had a great time watching this! Its concept of time travel is nonsense, but it is consistent... sort of

I wouldn't say this is a great movie, but it hit right in the sweet spot for a comfort movie
