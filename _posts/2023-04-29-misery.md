Misery is, by most accounts, a success. Two standout lead performances — Kathy Bates is perfect as every nurse I’ve ever met — a quirky script that both honors and exceeds Stephen King's work by tip-toeing between horror and comedy at the proper measures for a mainstream audience — namely, erring on the side of fluffy and heightened — and cinematography that exaggerates the highs and lows to keep even the quieter moments watchable

“I’m your number one fan. There’s nothing to worry about. You’ll be fine. I’ll take care of you.”

I wish I could go to a world where this wasn’t the subject of so much parody to experience this with fresh eyes. I think I would appreciate what this is doing more

Still, it does what it does well, even when most of it feels a bit too familiar
