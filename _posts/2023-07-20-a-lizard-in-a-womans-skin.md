<blockquote><i>Anything’s on the cards when you’re on a trip. You’re capable of anything. Some take a jump and think they’re flying. You can kill someone and not know nothin about anything</i></blockquote>Carol dreams of trains, halls of naked people, and her Debaucherous neighbor Julia, with whom she has sex. In real life, Carol is repressed and resents her neighbor

One night, the dream takes a turn, and Carol stabs Julia to death. The following day, we learn that Julia has been murdered

One of the best-crated giallo I’ve seen — the movie gets to play with eroticism, dreams, and drugs all while maintaining a coherent plot — a flaw I often forgive for wilder giallo films that twist themselves into nonsense

<b>Stray Thoughts</b>

- The wind on the fur looks cool
- The whistling in the soundtrack is grating, not Morricone’s best work
