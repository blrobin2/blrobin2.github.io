**Rating:** 2.5/5

<blockquote><i>Here I am holding this jack. Do you have a jack I can borrow?</i></blockquote>I watched the R-rated version, and it's hard to imagine that the excised gore and viscera would have made a significant difference in my rating of this

Jack is an architect. Or Jack is an engineer who aspires to be an architect. Regardless, Jack is also a serial killer

Jack is Lars Von Trier, who has built a career out of other's misery, in conversation with himself as Virgil from <i>Dante's Inferno</i>, recalling five murder moments as Virgil guides him to hell

There's no connective tissue between murders, no patterns beyond the need to film it — that <i>Peeping Tom</i> fetishization of constructing the perfect image — that <i>Hannibal</i> obsession with elevating death to art

A couple of points, the movie achieves legitimately funny black humor — Jack tries to leave a murder scene, but his OCD is so pronounced that he keeps going back in and cleaning — but those moments wash away in grim naval gazing

Once it digressed into the endless rant on wine, decay, and how iconic Mussolini and Hitler's "artworks" are, I got so bored. Using footage from <i>Night and Fog</i> to provoke is so childish — it just reminds me of the boys in high school who made Nazi jokes to be edgy

The movie isn't inherently flawed — the performances are all great, and some of the cinematography is striking — some shots are unlike anything I can recall seeing. Also, I like the idea of a serial killer recounting his life to Virgil

I like several of Von Trier's movies, but this is not one of them. In some ways worse than a failure — just a clumsy masturbation session for his diehard fans
