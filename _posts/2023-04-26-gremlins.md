Seeing Phoebe Cates and Judge Reinhold, I have to assume this movie is in the Fast Times at Ridgemont High extended universe

This is why furbies freak people out. They look like uncanny valley mogwai. Similarly, baby Yoda is too far in the other direction for me ‚Äî too cute, with no personality

The second there was more than one mogwai, I was so stressed out üò∞

Just top-notch puppetry work and design, Chris Walas is brilliant

I didn‚Äôt know this was a Christmas or a terrible dad inventor movie. They keep shooting ‚Äútoothpaste‚Äù all over the dad, and it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ weird. My favorite invention of his is the hammer with a trillion batteries attached to it

I love how gross the mogwai transformation is‚Ä¶ they seem to change from mammal to reptile?

Mom‚Äôs a total badass. She destroys those dudes with zero hesitation

Once the transformed mogwai falls into the pool ‚Äî near the halfway point ‚Äî the movie ultimately falls apart. As a kid's movie, it probably holds attention, but I begged for it to be over

Appreciate the craftsmanship on display and some of the performances, but the story is not for me
