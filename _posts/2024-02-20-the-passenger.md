Randy (Johnny Berchtold) has a nightmare of himself as a child. He sees someone holding their eye and spraying blood everywhere.

He gets up before sunrise to drive to his job at a local fast-food place. Randy does what he's told and tries not to cause any friction. Even his manager doesn't understand his work ethic. Still, his manager offers him a management position at a new store.

His coworker, Benson (Kyle Gallner), is quiet. Chris is an asshole, and Jess just wants to fuck Chris. Chris bullies Randy into eating a day-old burger. Benson tells Chris to stop, to no avail.

So Benson goes to his car, grabs a shotgun, and kills Chris. He reloads and shoots the manager. When Jessie won't stop screaming, he shoots her too.

Benson gets Randy to help Benson move the bodies and clean up the store. He pushes Randy into his car, and Benson drives off. Benson guesses seven hours before someone notices.

— Seven hours! Who knows where we'll be by then?

Johnny Berchtold nails the quiet, repressed kid. 

Kyle Gallner is playing a variation on the fucked up guy he's been typecast for ages. So yeah, he does a good job.

The movie evolves beyond its setup, and that's when it becomes engaging.

This movie was so close to being gay, and it isn't. 

Good performances, shocking gore, and an emotional core help save this stilted script.
