<i>CW // Misogyny, Violence, Blood, Murder, Sexual Assault</i>

In the post-apocalyptic wasteland of 2021, roving gangs fight for survival. After an army kills her brother, Marya sends her hawk to find help as she seeks somewhere to hide.

When a man tries to claim her, the Sisterhood helps her out. The Sisterhood is a nomadic band of women warriors with unique psychic abilities. Led by Alee, who has the power to move objects with her mind, the women seek to liberate the women of the wasteland and heal the war-torn land.

When Marya reveals she can speak to and understand her hawk, the other members invite her to join them on their quest to rescue the remaining members of The Sisterhood.

The main actors are solid and hold the movie together, especially when the flailing kid actors threaten to bring the scene to a crashing halt. Lynn-Holly Johnson gives the top performance, having the closest thing to a character.

The movie also has stakes and isn't afraid to kill kids. So, even if the emotional scenes don't land, they feel earned.

The music is cheesy, and the fight choreography is pretty awful. The camera leers in uncomfortable ways at The Sisterhood. Whatever the movie's intentions, dudes made it horny.

The third act is where most of the budget is â€” it goes full <i>Fury Road</i> with wacky vehicles. military tanks, and explosions. It isn't as exciting as it sounds, but it's enough to get me to the finish line.

<b>**_ SPOILER TALK _**</b>

If the Sisterhood follows a goddess who can free them at any time, why does the goddess wait until the last possible moment to show up?
