Matthew J. Elliott and Ian Potter riff on this one. So, we'll see if I write down any of their jokes.

This movie is the bastard brother to <i>A Bucket of Blood</i> and <i>Little Shop of Horrors</i>, both horror-comedy collaborations between Charles B. Griffith and Roger Corman. The movie is Corman's favorite ending to all of his films.

If the two riffers could grant the movie a second to play out, I could tell you if I liked the movie or not. But they simply cannot shut up, and I don't think I caught a single line of dialogue. As the film ends, they continue talking over a black screen for another minute.

I do love the monster — he's so silly.
