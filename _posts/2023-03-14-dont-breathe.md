**Rating:** 4/5

<i>13 Reasons Why </i>kid breaks into a house for a girl and that girl’s boyfriend, and a <i>People Under the Stairs </i>happens

A tight script and sharp cinematography more than make up for the lackluster lead performances — well except for Jane Levy, she’s great

It starts to fall apart once a particular choice is made, but not so much so that it ruins the movie — it just starts to lumber towards an absurd conclusion
