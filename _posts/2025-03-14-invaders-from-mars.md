**Rating:** 2.5/5

I saw Tobe Hooper's remake about a year ago, and while I appreciate parts of it, I just couldn't connect with it. The original has roughly the same plot, but its charm is more immediate. Oddly, it helps that the scientists instantly believe David. Both movies, however, become remarkably dull once they focus on the military.

I love the weirdo vocals in the score!

* Venus HAS been distant latelyâ€¦
* ðŸŽµ We both have punchable faces!
* Free slipper! My horoscope was right!
* They eventually banned indoor leaf-burning in their town
* â€” Doctors are like ministers; you can tell them anything. â€” That's not true at all!
* Sure, everyone has a favorite astronomer.
* You can't go out there, Colonel! You'll get sand in your shoes!
