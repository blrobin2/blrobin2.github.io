Treat Williams does a great Han Solo impersonation (there’s even a comment on his piece of junk ship), Famke Janssen never gets to have this much fun onscreen

Too much setup, just start this movie thirty minutes in, and you’ll figure out everything. Once you get to the gore corridor — you’ll know it when you see it — that’s when the movie starts being fun
