- They're having so much fun passing on a two-lane highway.
- The music gets louder and more intense when they yell.
- Just two mobsters getting a history lesson on the colonization of Brazil.
- "Give me the damn veggies," grunts Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson
- (guns cocking)(speaking Portuguese)
- "Tu feo, man!"
- Everyone lists specs on tech like they're reading the product description.
- — "Let's go get some cars." — "Nice."
- The Rock is SO sweaty.
- "You really like doing that stuff, huh?" is the most generic pickup line. I am going to use it for every scenario ever.
- They dropped, like, three grenades on that car and they only exploded after the third one. I'm just imagining a scene where grenades keep dropping but none of them go off.
- Was this the movie where Vin and The had stipulations in their contract that they couldn't lose in a fight?
- The safe dragging scene is an all-timer for car stunt nonsense
- "This is big boy stuff!"
- "You know I can't let you two go. I ain't made that way."
