I smell studio intervention on this one. A: the kills seem designed to be more brutal, but this shied away. B: the movie carefully incorporates the pieces of reality that inform M3GAN’s choices… until she starts killing

Or, just as likely, the writer wasn’t completely successful marrying the influences together

I think there are pieces of a better movie within here — I actually liked the dramatic first hour — but it’s getting a sequel so maybe they can find a more focused movie the next time around?

Still, a very watchable, often enjoyable movie. I’m glad I saw it in theaters
