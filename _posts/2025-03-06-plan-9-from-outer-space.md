**Rating:** 2/5

I think nostalgia is making this movie better each time I watch it.

* Trash, the loamy keepsake...
* Where's my soul??

* The mellow clarinet solo adds to the terror.
* Where are we in relation to each other?
* Officer Child investigates.
* Honey, the white men we ordered are here.
