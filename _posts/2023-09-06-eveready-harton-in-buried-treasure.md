<blockquote><i>The first porno-cartoon was made in New York. It was called "Eveready Harton" and was made in the late 1920s, silent, of course—by three studios. Each one did a section of it without telling the other studios what they were doing. Studio A finished the first part and gave the last drawing to Studio B [...] Involved were Max Fleischer, Paul Terry and the Mutt and Jeff studio. They didn't see the finished product till the night of the big show. A couple of guys who were there tell me the laughter almost blew the top off the hotel where they were screening it</i></blockquote>— Ward Kimball, Disney animator and one of the Nine Old Men
