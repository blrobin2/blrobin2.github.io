**Rating:** /5

<blockquote><i>This theatre is proud to announce that the following presentation is ridiculous.</i></blockquote>

The production value of this is remarkable. It’s like Hammer meets <i>Looney Tunes</i>, complete with excessive horniness. The film doesn’t have a story — it’s more vignettes with visual gags. Whoever the guy is with the rolled cigarette in his mouth, he has great comedic timing and facial expressions.
