Watching for a podcast

I’ve been dreading this one. I’ve seen a wide array of opinions, and I can’t tell who is irony-poisoned and who is genuine

The kids are awful, and it definitely seems for comedic effect, but I suppose I’m not the audience for it. Or we’re supposed to root for bad things to happen to them?

Thankfully, the “grandma” is a total weirdo, puking, scratching at the walls, and chasing the kids around. Like, she’s obviously not their grandma, right? When the grandpa said, “Don’t go in the basement; there’s mold,” I was like, “Right, because that’s where the bodies are.”

Maybe I would’ve liked it more if I had seen it when it was Shyamalan’s “return to form.” But it’s got creeps and spooks! It’s not so bad except for everything the kids say or do (and I guess demonizing older adults with mental disorders)

#### Stray Thoughts

- Immediately, Kathryn Hahn was onscreen, and I felt a sudden relief. Less than five minutes pass and Kathryn Hahn is no longer onscreen. Just as she disappears, “Written and Directed by M. Night Shyamalan.” The horror begins
- Oh no, this white kid is rapping with a particular affect… and he does it more than once
- “You’re not a Yahtzee master. That takes ten years” Okay, movie, you got me, I laughed
- I could have done without the diaper stuff
