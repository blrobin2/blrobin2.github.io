<b>*** Stray Thoughts / Spoilers ***
</b>* I'm high, so...
* This is Kel Mitchell's updated demo reel.
* It was worth seeing just for the Lori Beth Denberg cameo.
* The trapeze artist joke made me laugh.
* Dog named Attack, bird named Don't.
* I laughed when they set Kel's burger car on fire. Out of context that sounds mean.
* I can't believe the kid from <i>Moonlight</i> is Ed 2.
* "I would have Kel's baby." â€” Hollis
