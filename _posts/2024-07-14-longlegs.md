FBI Agent Lee Harker has an intuition â€” you might call it psychic, but it isn't consistent. But when she intuits the location of a killer, Agent Carter brings her on to a serial killer case.

In each case, the father kills the wife and children, then himself. Each crime scene has an encrypted letter signed by Longlegs. If not for the letter, detectives would have no other connection. But when Agent Harker comes on the case, a cold trail grows red hot as she sees patterns that may break the case wide open.

I wish I could have seen this before all the rave reviews came in. I've wanted to watch this since I saw the first cryptic trailer. What the trailer presented was a spiral of patterns and haunting images. What we get is, all told, a pretty standard serial killer story.

Most disappointing for me is Nicholas Cage's performance. He could have been something sinister and unsettling, but Perkins asked for Kookie Cage, so we have a weird singing and dancing cartoon traipsing this horror movie.

Despite my disappointment, I had a fun journey throughout. I hope to revisit it and see something I might have missed. Or perhaps, knowing what it is, I'll be able to appreciate what it's doing.
