**Rating:** 4/5

Carole (Catherine Deneuve) is a manicurist accosted by men on all sides. She regularly disassociates, loses track of time, forgets what she is doing. Cracks start forming in the pavement, on the walls, someone is always in the periphery

Deneuve is brilliant and subtle in what she does here â€” I love her

The end goes a little long, but overall this works for me
