**Rating:** 3/5

<b>Stray Thoughts</b>
* The microorganisms under the microscope are neat — I love how much they freak out Dr. Lanyon
* <i>“Paradise for the eyes but hell for the soul”</i> is what I want on my tombstone
* Chekov’s poison ring
* John Barrymore’s performance as Mr. Hyde clearly influenced Nic Cage, particularly in <i>Vampire’s Kiss</i>
* Is the movie moralizing about getting blackout drunk? Excuse me, “black abyss of torment” drunk?
* The giant Hyde spider crawling around his room is creepy
* There’s a point where he’s reaching his hands up to god in desperation, and it looks like he’s miming making it rain for god
