#### Stray Thoughts / Spoilers

- Whoa, Judy Garland walking around in a towel.
- I can see Liza Minnelli's resemblance in this movie.
- This set looks like it was designed for monochrome.
- She's gonna break Orville's heart, isn't she?
- In 1950, the bar for romance was, "He asked me if I could sing over a sandwich."
- I love a good matte painting farm.
- If this movie doesn't end with Herb being hanged... then again, what did they expect, letting a homosexual drive a tractor?
- Judy Garland tapping in heels is iconic.
- Gene Kelly went in for that kiss without breaking up with Judy Garland's sister â€” so scandalous!
- The newspaper dance number rules.
- Why does everyone keep picking Judy Garland's flowers and giving them to her?
- I hate the animal calls song so much. First time I've ever reconsidered my crush on Gene Kelly
- "Come On, Get Happy" is so iconic! What a leggy outfit! And those suits!
  Orville yells, Quiet!" like Mel Blanc.
