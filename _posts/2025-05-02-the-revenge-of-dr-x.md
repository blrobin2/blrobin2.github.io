I stopped watching the Rifftrax for <i>Fist of Fury </i> because the barrage of racist jokes annoyed me. I thought I was safe here, but Dr. Bragan travels to Japan, and, sure enough, the gross riffs start flying. The movie itself has its fair share of Orientalism. It's not a good movie, I'm sorry to say!

* If you're a fan of odd, inappropriate music choices, this movie has to top your list.
* You know, I wouldn't know what is happening without the <i>Fiddler on the Roof</i> incidental music.
* It's not in most executive assistants' job descriptions to swim down to the ocean floor and help their boss cut a giant tube creature so he can graft it onto a Venus flytrap.
* Noriko likes to plan ahead for all acts against God.
* I wonderâ€¦ is there Voldemort/Elmer Fudd slashfic?
* Every time I try to steal blood, something bad happens!
* Meanwhile, someone slowly empties a bag of marbles onto a snare drum.
* Somewhere, lava exists!
