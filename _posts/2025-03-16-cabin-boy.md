I saw this movie when my dad rented it on VHS as a kid. He hated the film, and I was too young to have opinions, so I hated it. Thankfully, Owen wanted to revisit it, so here we are.

This movie is dumb as hell, but when it's funny, it hits. And the sets are so <i>Jason and the Argonauts</i>-coded! I was surprised at how short it isâ€”weirdly if they cut out the cabin boy stuff, this movie would be pretty good! Well, and all the misogyny.

Some quotes I enjoyed:

<blockquote><i>â€” Fret not, Daddy! I'll be with you in a saint's whisper.</i></blockquote><blockquote><i>â€”  These pipes are clean! And how!</i></blockquote><blockquote><i>â€”Â Half man plus half shark equals a complete gentlemanÂ </i></blockquote><blockquote><i>â€” ðŸŽµOoo-wee</i></blockquote>
