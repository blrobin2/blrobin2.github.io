**Rating:** 1/5

* Don’t point that goat at me, it might go off
* That thing they’re holding onto must be the plot line
* She’s not dead, she’s probably having the slime of her life
* Kissing you is like plunging my tongue into a vat of shiitake mushrooms
* It looks like one long boring commercial for London Fog rain coats

1/2 of the movie is obscured by insane amounts of fake fog — not necessary, the slime dudes looks pretty good!
