**Rating:** 1.5/5

<i>Movie CW // Misogyny, Racism
MST3K CW // Misogyny, Homophobia, Racism, Classism</i>

This movie was one of the most transformative movie experiences in college. I didn't know bad movies could be this ridiculous.

Paul Chaplin was the only writer who thought the movie was intentionally funny â€” the other writers thought the filmmakers made this movie with grave sincerity. From what I've read, it's a bit of both.

* And now a word from my sponsor
* Who am I kidding? I can't build a cat
* I hate your crotch
* I hate to be picky, but pumas aren't known for flying
* Help, I'm falling at a 60-degree angle, breaking all laws of physics!
* [Donald Pleasance accent] My posse
* [Donald Pleasance accent] whee
* Showing you now the general vicinity of the heart
* Oh, the network shouldn't have bought Kelsey Grammar a helicopter
