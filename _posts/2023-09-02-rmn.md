**Rating:** 3.5/5

Mattias works at a sheep processing plant in Germany — when a shift leader calls him a slur, he headbutts him and walks off, hitchhiking to his wife's place in Transylvania, looking to be more involved in his son Rudi's life

In Transylvania, Csilla is a higher-up at a small bread factory and needs extra workers over the holiday. She ends up hiring three men from Sri Lanka, causing an uproar in the village

The movie is a little loose, and it's hard to see how the two stories relate to one another beyond the intersection of characters until the third act, which is a stunning progression that hits hard once the credits roll

With thoughtful writing, great acting, and some impressive cinematography at times, this could have been a classic if it had a better handle on how it all fits together

* Amazon Prime categorizes this as a "documentary" — I mean, kind of?
