**Rating:** 1.5/5

<blockquote><i>After viewing The Amazing Colossal Man for the sixth or seventh time, we all became very fond of wandering the halls of Best Brains, repeating in a deep, sonorous voice, "What sin could a man commit in a single lifetime...</i> — Mike Nelson, <i>The MST3K Amazing Colossal Episode Guide</i></blockquote>
Can't wait for Denis Villeneuve's adaptation of this movie.
