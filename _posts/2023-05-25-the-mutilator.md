Ed Jr is cleaning his dad’s guns for his dad’s birthday and accidentally shoots his mom in the back — the way he looked down the barrel, I was hoping it would be him. The dad comes home and chases his son off with one of the guns and proceeds to take the body into his den and have a drink with it

Cut to the kid as an adult, mocking his alcoholic father with his friends, revealing his dad asked him to clean a condo at the beach. Little do they know that Dad is still there, lying in wait to kill them for some reason (I guess because they’re having sex since the movie cannot stop talking about Pam being a virgin)

Totally unoriginal on paper, and none of the plot matters, but as someone who has rented a beach house at Atlantic Beach, it hits closer to home than most slashers. And the gore is surprisingly well done — Sue and the hook is an all-timer for brutal kills, yeesh!

Overall, very funny

<b>Stray Thoughts</b>

- The most ominous version of “Happy Birthday” in a minor key, so funny
- The NC accents are so brutal. It reminds me of home
- His dad has a picture of a guy he accidentally killed with a motorboat. The image is posed like a fishing trophy?
- The soundtrack for when the killer is about is pretty good. The synths sound crunchy and aggressive
- Slowest undressing scene when they go skinny dipping in the pool
- Ed Jr tied up is the most realistically whiney I’ve seen someone
- (Sobbing) “Jesus Christ, that’s my dad.”
- We even get a couple of bloops at the end, hell yeah
