I need to track down a DVD copy of this so I can watch with Joe Bob Brigg's commentary.

- The shroud of David Schwimmer
- Ahh good ol fashioned nightmare fuel
- The Storage Units of Dr. Caligari
- Sound, are you getting this? We'll move on, we have other lines
- Watch how the tapeworm goes back into my hand
