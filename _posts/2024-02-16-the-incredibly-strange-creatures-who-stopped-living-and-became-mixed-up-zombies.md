**Rating:** 1/5

I need to track down a DVD copy of this so I can watch with Joe Bob Brigg's commentary.

* The shroud of David Schwimmer
* Ahh good ol fashioned nightmare fuel
* The Storage Units of Dr. Caligari
* Sound, are you getting this? We'll move on, we have other lines
* Watch how the tapeworm goes back into my hand
