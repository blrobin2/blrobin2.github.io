<b>Iceland, 1940, during British occupancy</b>

A minister asks a boy who is going there for work to check in on his daughter, who he heard drinking too much sacramental wine

In Reykjavik, the British have overrun the city, mocking him and his backwater ways (aka drinking milk on the job site). While on the job, he meets a peculiar British soldier named Tilbury, who gives him a bar of chocolate

Later, he spots the daughter — who we learn that he's had a crush on since childhood — cavorting with Tilbury, sending him into a rage (referring to a historical phenomenon called Ástandið)

Tilbury's weird behavior — climbing through pipes, puking up buttermilk, and squealing like a pig — leads the boy to suspect that Tilbury is a tiiberi: an imp of Icelandic lore who steals milk for its summoner

This movie is a hard one to pin down. And it does quite a bit despite being just under an hour. I don't think it makes excellent use of that time, and I feel like parts of it are Icelandic references that I'm missing

But the Tilbury character is a total weirdo — he has moments that remind me of Beetlejuice — perpetually gross and off-putting

I like it, but I'll need to revisit it in the future
