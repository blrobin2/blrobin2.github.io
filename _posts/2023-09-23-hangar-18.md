**Rating:** 2/5

I accidentally mixed up a file and got this season 0 episode â€” the season where they tried to improv jokes instead of writing them ahead of time. No jokes stood out, but the copy I watched had terrible audio

The movie is like <i>The Da Vinci Code </i>in the breadth of its inane conspiratorial cover-up story. Despite being fairly engaging in places, it spends far too much time talking about its dumb ideas
