**Rating:** 3.5/5

The exaggerated animation style stressed me out initially but I grew accustomed by about 1/2 way. Also the subtitles were not helpful, just [Sings in French] or the occasional sound effect

The dog made me super sad, he just seemed so sad and whiny the entire movie. But I guess that reflects the movie as a whole, where everyone seems neurotic and obsessive in one way or another

Overall, didn’t really care about the story but I appreciate the uniqueness of it and the weirdness of the animation. Also, gotta love a movie where a group of old women are the heroes
