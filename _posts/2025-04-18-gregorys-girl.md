It's early morning in Cumbernauld. Several boys play football before school. Gregory's team loses—their eighth loss in a row. The coach, Phil Menzies, proposes switching up the team, trying out new people, and letting some folks go. Gregory, for example.

<blockquote><i>— We need goals. It's your job to get them, and you don't!
— Well, nobody's perfect. It's a tricky time for me.</i></blockquote>

Gregory's father, Mike, whom Gregory calls Mike, teaches driver's education. Gregory accidentally walks in front of the car. Mike stops Gregory to schedule breakfast in the kitchen on Friday since neither he nor his Mum sees much of Gregory.

Menzies tries out some new strikers to replace Gregory. Among the tryouts is Dorothy. Menzies is reticent to try out Dorothy, but she insists. Dorothy demonstrates far superior skills to the other tryouts. Gregory happens to pass and falls hard for Dorothy.

<blockquote><i>— Have you ever been in love? I'm in love.
— Since when?
— About half an hour ago. It's great. I feel restless, and I'm dizzy. It's wonderful. Bet I don't get any sleep tonight.
— That sounds more like indigestion.</i></blockquote>

The film follows Gregory as he ineptly pursues Dorothy, even if it may cost him a position on the football team. But maybe Dorothy isn't the girl for him, yeah?

This movie is so funny! Gregory is so ridiculous yet perfectly believable as an awkward, know-it-all teenager. His friends are all childlike in their way. Andy, for example, still likes to watch the big trucks on the freeway. Andy and Charlie feel totally inept regarding women, especially once Gregory starts pursuing them. I love how the film also shows the interaction between the male teachers, showcasing just how little they've grown up compared to the boys they teach.

<blockquote><i>— Look at all these men.
— Boys?
— What's the difference?</i></blockquote>

As a product of the 80s, the film grossly objectifies several of the women we encounter. We first meet Gregory and his friends spying on a woman changing. In Home Economics, Steve mansplains pie crust to Susan before patting her on the bum, leaving a hand-shaped flour print on her. That said, the film goes out of its way to show how hopelessly dumb the boys are. It also conveys how the women in Gregory's life have helped him get where he is, especially his 10-year-old sister, Madeleine. It's not perfect by any means, but 

This film may be my favorite teen comedy from the 1980s—at least that I've seen thus far.


<b>*** Stray Thoughts / Spoilers ***</b>
* Why the hell is Gregory putting on deodorant on his shirt? His pits are blue. 
* Andy likes watching the big trucks on the freeway.
* Gregory starts to change clothes but sees the open window, remembers the nurse, and thinks better of it.
* Gregory's electric toothbrush! It looks like <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.timetoast.com/public/uploads/photo/5540318/image/0fca452501e1f88b6d21132c86599098">the one Boots the Chemists put out</a>. 
* Gregory squeezes some Primula Cheese Spread on a Bonio dog biscuit—teenage appetites.
* The sprawl of small children, including one in a tree.
* Gregory and I have the same problem: we fall hardest for lesbians.
* "Hey Dorothy… I'd like to have a chat with you for the school magazine. I want to interview you and that girl in 2A that had the triplets."
* A random kid in a penguin costume is being sent to different rooms.
* Steve deals pastries to the head teacher, who looks around as if he fears getting caught.
* Billy offers Madeleine a cigarette while she waits outside to counsel her brother Gregory.
* Bullying the year one for a comb
* This movie uses some "Oh Brother" bass lines to great effect.
* Gregory could not have flubbed up that date proposal more, and Dorothy still said yes! There's a lesson here…
* Madeleine tells Gregory not to tell the joke about Batman and Superman. Just thinking about it makes him laugh.
* — "Can you drive?" — "No, but it runs in the family."
* That camera turns when they're Earth dancing is *chef's kiss*
* —" Put me down for six! Nah, make it a half-dozen." I know this movie didn't originate that joke, but it still makes me laugh.
