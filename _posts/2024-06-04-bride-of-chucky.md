At the end of <i>Child’s Play 3</i>, as with every Chucky movie thus far, Chucky is dead. Whereas the previous film took place in the mystical world of 1998 as seen in 1991, this movie takes place in the actual 1998, one month after the events of <i>Child’s Play 3</i>.

It’s a stormy evening at the Lockport Police Department Evidence Depository. Jason’s mask, Michael Meyer’s mask, and Freddy Kreuger’s claw glove lay locked up, hinting at the meta tone this movie will take. Officer Bailey opens a locker, removes a garbage bag, and places a folder inside.

In the car, he calls a woman, telling her he has the goods — she better have the money. He parks at a warehouse, waiting for her arrival. While he does, he grows curious about the contents of the bag. He opens it to look in. His confused face turns white as someone slashes his throat. We tilt up to see a blonde woman named Tiffany Valentine. She opens the bag and takes out Chucky's smashed remains.

Rob Zombie’s Living Dead Girl plays as the camera looks at various newspaper cutouts for the new viewers. Meanwhile, Tiffany digs through a chest full of doll parts. With those, she sews and staples together what parts of Chucky she can. Tiffany consults Voodoo for Dummies, placing Chucky on a pentagram of sand. She performs the ritual, but it doesn’t seem to do anything.

Damien, who thinks he’s dating Tiffany, comes over. She notices Chucky isn’t on the pentagram anymore. So, she sets Chucky on Damien’s chest and gives the rundown on how she used to date Chucky and that they were to get married. On cue, Chucky rips out Damien’s lip ring and suffocates him with a pillow.

Things only get more bizarre from here. Tiffany and Chucky fight, leaving Tiffany dead and resurrected in a bride doll. The movie follows them as they search for human bodies.

The puppet work is so much better in this one! They have so many more puppetry jokes, including a sex scene that predates Team America and is, thankfully, more tasteful. Relatively speaking.

Having an openly gay character is a pleasant change of pace. The film relegates him to token sidekick, but at least he isn’t a walking stereotype.

This movie is silly fun, and the best one since the first. I don’t love it as much as the first, but I appreciate the change in direction.
