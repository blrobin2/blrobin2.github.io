Story 1: 3.5/5 - love a house full of weird workers and a laughing… ghost?
Story 2: 2/5 - Renovated house infested with “bugs”, pretty boring 
Story 3: 2.5/5 like the surreal quality of a house marooned in a flooded city, but don’t really care about the tenants/renovation stuff

Wish the other two stories were more like the first one
