**Rating:** 3.5/5

<b>Obvious observations</b>
* Everyone is so sweaty (except Ted Danson… 🤔)
* That’s a lot of chimes!
* I don’t think I’ve ever been so horny as to break a window
* That’s a dumb hat
* oh boy, this isn’t going to go well is it?

I’ve seen this formula almost exactly, so it’s hard to be too invested, but it’s well-made, well-acted, and horny as hell so I’m on board

<b>*** SPOILERS ***</b>
* younger Mickey Rourke always shocks me
* a clown driving a convertible? An inauspicious sign
* William Hurt looks bored even when he’s killing a guy
* “Tap dancing Ted Danson!” should be a swear
* Kathleen Turner walking into the dark, great shot
