**Rating:** 3/5

Jonah episode. Pearl calls Kinga "bittersweetheart." I dig it. They laughed at each other's jokes a lot more this episode.

* Gamera vs. Kramer vs. Kramer
* Lovely day for some light colonialism
* Oof, right in the kaiju
* What's it called when you've seen a giant monster fight before?
* — I'd say it's kind of like a curse. — The good kind or the bad kind?
* Welcome to the Westminster Jager show — he'll need to jump this boat and do a somersault, and... oh, the judges aren't going to like that.
* Light as a Jiger, stiff as a board
* — His body is changing its color — Yes, thanks, we have eyes
* White Chicks 3: Into the Monsterverse
* Gamera's dead, and loving it
* It sounds like a nest of wild Bjorks
* I will kill again!
