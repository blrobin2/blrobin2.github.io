**Rating:** 2.5/5

Jenna Ortega does what she can to carry this movie to the finish line

Dermot Mulroney giving the most hilariously wonky performance of his career, and I think it works!

Liana Liberato is fine — I really liked her in <i>The Beach House</i>, so I hope this gives her bigger opportunities

Josh Segarra — who I learned about in <i>The Other Two — </i>is still playing himself, as he does in every role, but his sincere demeanor works well here to keep you guessing as to whether he’s a ghostface or not

Mason Gooding is really showing off his nepotism baby mediocrity in this one. He did alright in the previous movie, but here he did not pull it together

Overall, it’s the weakest of the Screams — even Scream 3, which is shocking — primarily because they didn’t invest in the meta as fully, so the script ultimately becomes the thing these movies were originally commenting on
