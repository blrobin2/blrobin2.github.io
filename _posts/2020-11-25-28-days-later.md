The first two thirds are incredible and pulled me in in a way I didn’t think it would. Once the military get involved, it loses some momentum. The climax, in which Jim the bike courier outwits and kills an entire military squadron, took me completely out of it. It’s not a failure, it’s just a shame they couldn’t do something that better matched the tone and attention the earlier bits did
