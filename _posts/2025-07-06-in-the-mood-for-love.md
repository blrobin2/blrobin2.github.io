**Rating:** 5/5

The last time I watched this, I was not as attentive or as aware of the political connotations at the heart of the movie. Seeing this in the theater in 4K is one of life's greatest gifts. So beautiful — and so much longing!

 I have sunglasses with an amber tint and they turn reds the same red as the hotel room curtains.
