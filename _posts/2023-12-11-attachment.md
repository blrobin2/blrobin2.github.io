**Rating:** 3/5

Maja, a Danish actress, has a meet-cute with Leah, an English academic, on a trip from London. The two hit it off and fall for one another.

When Leah is supposed to return home, she decides to stay with Maja. During the night, though, Leah has a seizure and breaks her leg. She must return to London.

During all of this, Leah's mum, Chana, calls her constantly. Leah still lives with her mum, and her mum is quite overbearing.

Maja decides to follow Leah to London. Chana is cold to Maja. She also follows several Jewish traditions and Kabbalist superstitions â€” amethyst to ward off demons, salt in the corners of the house, and so on. Still, her behavior is confusing, even to Leah.

The strength of this movie is Maja and Leah's relationship. Though the actors don't have incredible chemistry, their bond feels organic, which helps when things get weird.

But they also treat the viewer like they can't put 2 and 2 together. So, the plot threading is labored, erring on the side of making sure everything is obvious to the viewer.

I wanted to like this movie more, but I like several aspects. I need more horror romances in my life.
