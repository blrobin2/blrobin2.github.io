**Rating:** 2/5

The giant spider is so delightfully goofy that it's hard to hate this

* How can a movie have a guest star?
* I hope the earth has its diaphragm on
* The lord shall rain fire and brimstone... oh and giant spiders
* I figured we could have sex until this blows over
* You want a piece of milk?
* Ugh my bloody mary has legs
* Sheriff, if you can handle it, I'd like to show you my vasectomy scar
* I've called for the national guard, but he's not in
* I guess someone tampered in god's domain or somethingÂ 
* [tearfully] go packers
