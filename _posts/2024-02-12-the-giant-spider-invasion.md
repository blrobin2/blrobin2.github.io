The giant spider is so delightfully goofy that it's hard to hate this

- How can a movie have a guest star?
- I hope the earth has its diaphragm on
- The lord shall rain fire and brimstone... oh and giant spiders
- I figured we could have sex until this blows over
- You want a piece of milk?
- Ugh my bloody mary has legs
- Sheriff, if you can handle it, I'd like to show you my vasectomy scar
- I've called for the national guard, but he's not in
- I guess someone tampered in god's domain or something
- [tearfully] go packers
