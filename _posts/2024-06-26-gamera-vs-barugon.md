**Rating:** 2/5

KMTA episodes time! The collection I found is missing the first 3 eps and the unaired pilot. Straight out of the gate, the show had its deal figured out. Because it was local access, they had a call-in number and would play calls. My personal favorite:

<blockquote><i>Â I enjoyed the movie but really hated the constant interruptions that were on there. It was like being in a theater with a bunch of rude Jr. High teenagers. I hope you don't continue that program, not in that fashion anyway.</i></blockquote>Also, they didn't have to cut down the movie to fit a time slot.

I've warmed on Kaiju movies since I first watched this. It's still the Sandy Frank version, so it's not great, but it's still got the sick flying turtle action. Also, seeing it in worn-out VHS quality adds some charm.
