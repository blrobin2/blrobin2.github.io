**Rating:** 2/5

How do you adapt a book that no one liked reading in school? You make it A E S T H E T I C — beautiful lighting, perfectly centered frames of gore (complete with blood splatter on the lens), fight sequences reminiscent of John Wick

If you like war flicks, add this to your list of comfort movies. Otherwise, what’s the point?
