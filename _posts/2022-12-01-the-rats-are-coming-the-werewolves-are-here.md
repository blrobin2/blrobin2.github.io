**Rating:** 1/5

Watched to see just how bad it is — Andy Mulligan has been compared to Ed Wood — and yeah man, it’s bad, but not in a way that I can enjoy

Exception: theres a few minutes within the last 10 minutes where they all turn into werewolves and chase each other around, very goofy stuff
