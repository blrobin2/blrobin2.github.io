I'm finding Christopher Lee in the most unexpected places. It’s kind of amazing how cheap this movie looks with this cast. The score has some groovin' drums.

* Welp, time for my daily cry.
* Sorry, could you repeat that? I got distracted thinking about this horny farmer I know.
* Have you removed the necessary fluids from the woman? I don't want them or anything; I was just curious.
* That is some seriously heretical sperm!
* Concubines? I was hoping for a foosball table.
* It says Abort, Retry, Fail. Why would anyone choose Fail?
* I'm pretty sure this is the plot of every Rush album.
* We use radio to broadcast our telepathy? Do I have that right?
* There's no fighting it — I just love a good dossier.
