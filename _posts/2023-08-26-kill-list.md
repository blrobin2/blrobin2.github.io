Assassin/adult child Jay is running out of money because he nor his wife Shel know how to spend it. At a dinner party, his mate Gal tells him about a kill list. Gal's bird Fiona scratches an occult symbol on the back of one of their pictures when no one is looking

Fiona runs off on Gal before they meet up with their client. Jay and the client make a blood oath, and things get weirder from there as Jay starts to lose his cool

I didn't hate this movie — it had enough going on to get me through — but I didn't get much out of it, other than genre experiments are harder than they look, and no one seems to fail at them more publicly than Ben Wheatley (according to the internet, that is. I don't know who that is, and I don't care to find out)

#### Stray Thoughts

- Cooking up a rabbit your cat killed and left in the yard is insane
