In case the title is ambiguous, this film is about a group of teenage girls throwing a slumber party, only for a masked killer to crash it.

The previous <i>Slumber Party Massacre</i> movies benefited from their knowledge of and subversion of genre troupes. The first involved the victims in more active roles in their survival, and the second introduced a killer so over-the-top that we could laugh at his antics.

This film rests on the previous films's laurels, not developing the themes beyond "All men are trash." Which, yeah, but this doesn't add much that the other films didn't cover.

Also, the movie doesn't have characters. We have a pile of women the film introduces us to — killer fodder, essentially — but we don't get to know any of them.

Ken and Juliette meet on the beach, and the camera pulls out and recreates The Creation of Adam, where Juliette is God and Ken is the reposed Adam. I'm unsure what the movie says with this scene, but it's an unusual choice.

I don't think this movie is bad — it's just not all that interesting.
