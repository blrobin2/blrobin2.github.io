**Rating:** 3/5

Johnny is hysterical. He swings off lampposts and plays air guitar like he will break out into song. Instead, he just whines like a 30-year-old playing a teenager.

Damien looks like Christopher Guest in <i>This is Spinal Tap</i>. When he yanks off his hair, he looks like the Dean from <i>Community</i> for one brief moment.

There’s one great special effects scene where a giant ant drags Vincent Pastore into a stereo speaker. It’s so funny.

There are a lot of good and lousy monster makeup and effects, especially in the third act.
