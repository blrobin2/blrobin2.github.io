**Rating:** 4/5

Cold open to a no-context scene of a guy getting his head blown off? Fulci knows his audience

Some legitimately tense and surprising scenes! Fulci takes full advantage of zombies breaking off in bits and still coming for you. It never reaches the insanity of the Gates of Hell trilogy — there is still some pretty outrageous gore

Didn’t like that dude messing with the shark — I know they wanted the shot of his arm being ripped off, but I don’t know if it was worth it…
