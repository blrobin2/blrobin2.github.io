**Rating:** 3/5

A grandmother with mangled legs trying to capture red riding hood for her legs so she can dance again — a wolf man who wants red riding hood to fall in love with him, and will make her — a wild backstory about red hoods being summoned from inside the earth by bombs

On paper, an interesting idea. In practice, some okay songs and decent dancing, but too mired by the concept. Also, incredibly gory in the scene where a monster destroys the grandmother’s legs

Looks cool in that 90s music video sort of way
