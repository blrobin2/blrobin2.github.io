Stanisław Lem hated this adaptation of his book but hated <i>Stalker</i> too, so who knows with that guy.

Kevin Murphy said that the writing staff felt exhausted working on this episode, and he doesn't feel the segments were up to par with their other stuff this season. I didn't notice anything tremendously off-putting, and I like sarcastic Tom Servo so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
