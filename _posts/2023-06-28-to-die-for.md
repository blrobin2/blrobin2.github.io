Suzanne Stone (Nichole Kidman) is the subject of a documentary about the murder of her husband (Matt Dillon). In the process, we learn of her singular determination to be on television and from all the people who were around her

The mockumentary style doesn’t lend as much to the storytelling as it likes to think — every word said is a recapitulation of something we’ve already heard or seen elsewhere in the movie — and collapses in on itself when the camera decides to be omnipresent

Kidman does the best she can with the material, playing ruthless, porcelain, and unaware— she is the main reason this movie still comes up in conversation — that, and baby-faced Joaquin Phoenix as the lower-class kid who only knows he wants something other than his life

It’s a good movie, but I think a sharper perspective on what it wants to say and another editing pass would’ve made a more lasting impression
