As a child, a family adopted Laura from Good Shepherd Orphanage. Thirty years later, Laura brings her husband, Carlos, and their son, Simón, to the now-closed orphanage. Laura intends to reopen it as a facility for children with disabilities.

Simón has an active imagination. Laura encourages his imagination and plays along. One day, Laura finds him whispering to a boy named Tomás. Of course, Laura cannot see him.

Soon, Simón's friend grows to six. He tells Laura about a treasure hunt they have set up in which the winner gets a wish. Laura plays along, convinced that Simón set up the hunt himself. During the game, Simón uncovers his adoption papers. He reveals that Tomás told him that Simón is adopted. And that he will die.

The Guillermo Del Toro comparisons are expected—he, after all, helped produce the film. The film has a separate writer, director, and Del Toro's guidance, so there is more room for creative development.

So many contemporary horror movies aim for the slow burn with an explosive finale. What often happens is the film is boring. Here, we have a prime example of how to develop your story without boring the audience. Still, it's long for a horror movie and could probably use some cuts for pacing, but nothing significant.

For horror veterans, this film won't do much surprising. Instead, we have all the genre expectations and dread seeing how it plays out.
