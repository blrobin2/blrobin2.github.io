<blockquote><i>Not long ago, in the unexplored reaches of an unmapped swamp, the creative genius of one man collided with another's evil dream, and a monster was born. Too powerful to be destroyed, too intelligent to be captured, this being still pursues its savage dream</i></blockquote>Alex Holland (Ray Wise) is a scientist working on a top-secret formula that will allow plants to grow in inhospitable places. After a group of paramilitaries — led by Anton Arcane (Louis Jourdan), intent on hijacking the project for their nefarious plans  — kill one of his researchers, Alice Cable (Adrienne Barbeau) takes the researcher's place in the bog lab

I'm watching this movie because:

1. Adrienne Barbeau
2. Ray Wise
3. Wes Craven's daughter hated how passive the final girl is in this, which motivated him to make a more complex and decisive lead for <i>A Nightmare on Em Street</i>

Once one of the researchers pulled off his face Mission Impossible-style, I felt like this would be up my alley. The film leans into the rubber suit, <i>Creature from the Black Lagoon </i>qualities

Unfortunately, once (spoiler alert) Alex turns into the Swamp Thing, the movie becomes a long set of repetitive set pieces. The heavy action is intentional — Wes Craven wanted to prove to Hollywood that he can handle action and stunts

The third act redeems the movie with its Bond villain speeches and gross-out effects and transformations — without this, I wouldn't have enjoyed this as much

I'll be interested to see how DC handles the inherently campy nature of this story in their remake — lots of potential to make similar mistakes made in the Hulk movies

Overall, I like the setup more than the payoff, but there's some fun cheese in the mix

<b>Stray Thoughts</b>

- How are Ray Wise's lips even poutier in this than anything else I've seen him in?
- Walking through a swamp picking orchids — what is this, The Orchid Thief?
- I love the neon green substance
- The henchman trying the formula is pretty wild
- "Sorry, Bruno — it's every man for himself, and God against all." Brutal
