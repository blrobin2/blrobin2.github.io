**Rating:** 3/5

Beautiful cinematography, especially when Peggy first meets the ghost outside on an overcast night, the composition of his reveal, the shadow cast just over his face

The miniatures and sets are also great — another one of Claire's strengths

Once they find out the ghost is confirmed, a bidding war begins for who owns the spirit so that they can sell admission to see it — reminiscent of <i>Beetlejuice</i>, except crossing over is the desired outcome

This is the second film I've watched in the "disgraced ghost who must bring honor back to his family before he can pass on into the next life" genre — the other being <i>The Canterville Ghost</i>

Murdoch appearing at the dinner was terrific! They did like a reverse explosion and a massive gust of wind blowing 12ft curtains, legit chills

It took me a bit to warm up to this, but once it got going, it won me over

<b>Stray Thoughts</b>
* I, too, would instead be playing in the field with women than go to war
* A little premonitory, the idea of a castle in Florida becoming a public attraction
* "And now, we're gonna hear some real Scotch music!" Enter: a twelve-piece band in kilts playing swing
