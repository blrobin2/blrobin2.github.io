**Rating:** 2.5/5

If you turned Garden State inside out — complete with its manic pixie dream girl, fetishization of mental illness, and ennui as a personality trait — you’d get something approximating this: threadbare, stuffing exposed, but still just as empty

That said, it’s weird and gross, so I liked it more than I probably should
