**Rating:** 3/5

A movie of beautiful images and sweeping music tied loosely together with a meandering story and no fundamental themes. Like, I made up one about memories linking us to the earth and our loved ones giving us a reason to live, but that’s not present in the text

If you cut a couple of characters and ~30 minutes and made one change the direction the movie took, you’d have something pretty great. But what we get is pretty muddy, almost like they had the pictures first and had to make them all fit together

Also, penis clouds. Like, veins in their heads, growing, plopping down on the ground penis clouds. What the fuck?

Despite all of that, I found enough in the movie to enjoy, and I’m still curious to check out Your Name
