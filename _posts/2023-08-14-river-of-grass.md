Cozy (Lisa Bowman), bored and ignored, meets Lee (Larry Fessenden) at a bar one night, thinking his unsavory ways will mix up her life. But when they believe they shoot a guy and go on the lam, Cozy learns that the bad boy may just be another boy with mommy (and money) issues

A few good performances — Larry Fessenden seems to always get away with doing whatever he wants on screen — but some budget actors drag down their scenes. Thankfully, the movie is predominantly Bowman and Fessenden, so it's not a showstopper

In theory, I like a lot of the movie, but the execution is often dry and repetitive in a way that's hard to love. Still, I like the overall story, and I've seen worse when it comes to first-movie problems
