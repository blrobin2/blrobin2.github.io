Jonathan Glazer refuses to have a singular aesthetic or vision. Between this, <i>Birth</i>, and <i>Under the Skin</i>, I can’t determine any immediate similarities. Maybe there’s connective tissue to be found in his shorts?

On paper, this is his most by-the-books movie — criminal called out of retirement for one last job… what is this, GTA 5? — but the realization is on its own wavelength. Once you get the dream sequence with the bunny man/monster with the automatic, you know shit’s going to get weird

It feels like <i>Oceans 11</i> or a Guy Ritchie movie with an actual iota of chill — alternatively, absolutely zero chill

Ben Kingsley introduced with a killer beat, already spoken about as someone you don’t fuck with. He has the energy of a chihuahua that won’t stop biting at your ankles — perfected when he says “no” like 20 times in a row. Of course, if they bite you right, it hurts

Ian McShane has that icy stare that cuts right into you, I don’t know how Ray Winstone doesn’t just crumble in front of him

In and out in 88 minutes? Hell yeah
