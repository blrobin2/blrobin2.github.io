<b><a href="https://boxd.it/pTT2i/detail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Halloween: Ranked</a></b>

On Halloween 1998, twenty years after the events of <i>Halloween I</i> and <i>II</i>, someone murdered Loomis and took his file on Laurie Strode.

Laurie Strode faked her death and went into hiding, changing her name to Keri Tate. She is the headmistress of a private boarding school and has a son named John (Josh Hartnett).

Michael now knows where to find them.

Kids in school are talking about Frankenstein and how he waited until he had nothing left to confront his monster. Laurie won’t give him the chance.

After 17 years of skipping Halloween for his mother’s sake, Laurie gives John permission to go on a school field trip. Except John doesn’t go on the trip. He, his girlfriend Molly (Michelle Williams), and another couple hide away in the school to have an evening to themselves.

Michael Meyers is quietly stalking the premises, biding his time to strike.

We get the Laurie that fights back! Laurie couldn't move past her trauma, as she wasn't certain if it had ended. She was sadly right. But man, Jamie Lee Curtis rules in this.

Steve Miner, who is best known for <i>Soul Man</i>, directed this film, but the screenplay shows the unmistakable touch of Kevin Williamson, the writer of <i>Scream</i>. It’s not as good as his <i>Scream</i> movies, but it’s a sizable improvement to the previous <i>Halloween</i> sequels.

#### Stray Thoughts

- Nice Janet Leigh being “maternal” for a moment with her real-life daughter
- Watching <i>Scream 2</i> in the background
- So many babies! We get Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Josh Hartnett, Michelle Williams, that kid who played young Robin Williams in Jumanji, and whatnot.
- The kills are brutal! The person hanging from the light fixture was shocking (oh god, no pun intended).
