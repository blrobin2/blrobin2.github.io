**Rating:** 2.5/5

<blockquote><i>— Do you think we’ll ever find intelligent life out there?
— Who cares?</i></blockquote>A team of astronauts is on a mission to seek and destroy intelligent life, lest it interferes with colonization attempts — a sort of anti-<i>Star Trek</i>

The bedroom graffiti scene took me out of the movie — it wasn’t until after the movie was over that I considered that it was supposed to suggest that they behave like teenage boys

It wasn’t until The Barber of Seville started playing during the beach ball alien scene that I realized the movie was supposed to be funny. Thankfully, O’Bannon’s failure at comedy led him to the more successful <i>Alien</i>

Overall, I don’t think much of this works conceptually — it tries to combine the AI philosophy of <i>2001</i> with the black comedy of <i>Dr. Strangelove</i>, but the writers don’t have the comedic chops or sufficiently competent actors to pull it off — but the special effects and visuals are creative and cool, especially for how low budget the movie seems to be

<b>Stray Thoughts</b>
* Boiler looks like Tom DeLonge in the First Date music video
* I love the homespun instrument of wood and mason jars — total nonsense in a space movie
