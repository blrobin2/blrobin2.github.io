**Rating:** 3/5

I watched so much Brady Bunch on Nick at Nite as a kid â€” I forgot how many episodes I remember until they came up in the mash-up plot of this movie

The film style changes between the 70s look of the TV show when they're at home and a more 90s color grading elsewhere. The 70s look is such a faithful homage. Add to that the insane casting choices, and the movie create such an uncanny valley feeling

The movie seems to have required Sherwood Schwartz's approval, so the culture clash jokes are pretty hit or miss, and there are more than a few Gilligan's Island jokes

Ultimately, the movie is in favor of the Brady's positive vibes, so even though it isn't all that funny, it stays light and good-natured enough to go down easy
