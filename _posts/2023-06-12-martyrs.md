**Rating:** 4/5

A grotesque vision of purity and proximity to the divine through suffering and whether one can survive the revelation it brings

Lucie tracks down and murders the people who kidnapped and tortured her as a child — not for herself, but to appease the specter of another child she left behind in her escape

Anna gives herself over to Lucie’s delusions, tending to her and enabling her, but when Lucie is given her gift for doing what was asked of her, Anna must transfer that self-sacrifice elsewhere

Maybe the most realistically gory movie I’ve seen. I’m sensitive to razors, so the frequent razor/box cutter violence was a lot. Believe me: it gets so much worse as it goes

It took getting to the end of the movie to determine whether I liked it or not — all this? For what end? Ultimately, I do think it achieves something wholly of its own, for better or worse

Still, a part of me wishes I had not watched this
