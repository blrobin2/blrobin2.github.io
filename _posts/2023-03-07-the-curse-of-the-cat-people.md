**Rating:** 3.5/5

Amy’s birthday wish to “be a good girl” is so upsetting, especially as her father looks on smiling, like, “yeah, that’d be nice”. when the bad behavior is that she doesn’t play with the other kids and daydreams. He’s still a huge asshole

Is this where the trope of a kid finding a house that seems scary but is actually the home a nice old person who teaches them magic or whatever? It feels like such a staple of cartoons from my childhood

This whole movie actually feels like a couple of episodes from a 90s cartoon

<i>When children are playing alone on the green</i>
<i>In comes the playmate that never was seen.</i>
<i>When children are happy and lonely and good</i>
<i>The Friend of the Children comes out of the wood</i>

Ann Carter was so good in this, I was on the verge of tears at times

Wow, this really has nothing to do with cat people at all
