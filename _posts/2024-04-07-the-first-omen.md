<blockquote><i>— Sister, why is there a bad room?
</i><i>— Because some girls are bad.</i></blockquote>Arkasha Stevenson and I like many of the same movies — I caught a few references, including one to <i>Possession</i>. The difference between her and many other directors who enjoy the same films is that she has melded those influences into something impactful, unnerving, and inspiring.

No prequel has the right to be this good. The only reason I'm docking from my score is because of the requisite prequel beats that take away from the final product.

Still, this is one of the best horror movies I've seen this year. I was unnerved! I squirmed in my seat! A couple of scenes left my mouth agape — not kidding.

Also, this might be the most effective pro-choice movie, at least that I've seen.

The teeth imagery!! The stairs, the candles... <b>_chefs kiss_</b>
