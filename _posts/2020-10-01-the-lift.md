**Rating:** 2.5/5

“These damned machines will be the death of us all someday.”

This movie spends most of its time discussing affairs or relationships. It also spends a long time explaining the technical details of how elevators work and how microchips work (or at least the writer’s understanding of them)

Oh, and sometimes people die in elevator accidents

Another example of plot getting in the way of the movie, especially because most of it goes nowhere. The climax takes forever to do anything, but it’s pretty fun once it gets going

The “the last guy who had your job went insane” trope applied to elevator repair is pretty funny

The bad dubbing also got some laughs out of me as well
