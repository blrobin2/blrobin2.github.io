<blockquote><i>You can act happy, but your voice will tell the truth</i></blockquote>Ho Po-Wing and Lai Yiu-Fai, two on-again, off-again boys, go on a trip to Argentina to try and start over. But things go from bad to worse, and the relationship becomes abusive. Can they address their jealousy? Can Po-Wing stop fucking other boys?

The two have a toxic dynamic. It's a difficult watch because you want Po-Wing and Yiu-Fai to move on and figure out how to be happy apart, but they keep running back to each other, trying to start new without addressing any of their shit.

But together or apart, they both are lonely people.

For a 90s movie, it's impressive that no one is performing gendered roles or acting out any notable gay stereotypes. Although, look at that raw denim vest.

The story is a little too flat for a good chunk of the movie, but it finds a way to explore different dynamics.

Still, the performances are heartbreaking, and every frame is beautiful. Rich black and white — mesmerizing color — Christopher Doyle doesn't miss.
