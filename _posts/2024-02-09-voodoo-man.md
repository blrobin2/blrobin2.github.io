Dr. Richard Marlowe (Bella Lugosi) kidnaps women so he can drain their essence and give it to his zombie wife. When one of his henchmen (John Carradine) takes one woman out of her case to play with, she escapes, drawing unwanted attention.

The lair set is amusing, John Carradine is hilarious, Lugosi gives it the old college try, and the women all have incredible hair.

I watched the RiffTrax version, and it was okay — a bunch of gay panic jokes.

<b>Favorite RiffTrax jokes</b>
* It was an odd time living in the 40s when a second, dimmer sun would shine all night long
* Ah yes, another 27-year-old “girl”
* This was before people understood the health risks of dying in a big explosion
* I’m marrying the army
* Meanwhile, we join The Monster Mash, already in progress
* Sir, they canceled Gossip Girl. Please don’t beat me!
* My husband tells me you’re a zombie
* One! One dead sheriff!
