This rules even if it makes no sense, I love the opening credits. I'd watch the show this was cut from

- It's Heckraiser!
- Huh?! Huh?! Huh?! Huh?!
- Now I'm gonna spank you. Big time
- It looks like Ken is driving a Malibu Barbie Beach Jeep!
- In the land of Dairy Queen, we treat you right
- Meanwhile, back at the cool ship
- He's sending a message! He's saying, "my emblem came off!"
