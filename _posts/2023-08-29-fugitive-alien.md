**Rating:** 2/5

This rules even if it makes no sense, I love the opening credits. I'd watch the show this was cut from

* It's Heckraiser!
* Huh?! Huh?! Huh?! Huh?!
* Now I'm gonna spank you. Big time
* It looks like Ken is driving a Malibu Barbie Beach Jeep!
* In the land of Dairy Queen, we treat you right
* Meanwhile, back at the cool ship
* He's sending a message! He's saying, "my emblem came off!"
