An anthology film about women transforming into various <i>y√¥kai</i>

<b>Woman Transformation #1: Rokuro</b>
A model experiences spinal pain and issues that begin to show in her photos. X-rays show that her neck is growing longer and has elastic qualities

<b>Woman Transformation #2: Kamaitachi</b>
A woman with immaculate nails finds them growing longer and sharper, and she is no longer able to cut them without causing herself injury

<b>Woman Transformation #3: Noppera</b>
A school bully is attacked on the streets. In the hospital, her face slowly begins to disappear/seal up

I didn't have access to subtitles, so I could only get the gist of what was happening, so it doesn't feel fair to rate the film. I can say that of the three, the last one was legitimately horrifying

Movie distribution is frustrating!
