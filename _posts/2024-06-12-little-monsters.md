Sara and Dave are arguing because Dave forgot it was Sara's birthday. They've been together for nearly nine years. We jump into the middle of several arguments — several focus on Dave growing up and Sara wanting love and respect. They break up after their last fight.

<blockquote><i>I needed you to love me, David, and you're incapable of loving anyone but yourself. There's a big difference between being with someone and being there for someone.</i></blockquote>

Cut to five-year-old Felix with a tractor in hand. He wakes his uncle Dave, who is sleeping on the couch. Dave's sister, Tess, is letting Dave crash at hers while Dave figures out his life. Teddy McGiggle (Josh Gad) is singing on television. He announces he's coming to Australia to perform a show.

Tess threatens to kick Dave out unless he contributes, so Dave takes Felix to school. There, Dave meets Felix's teacher, Miss Audrey Caroline (Lupita Nyong'o), whom he falls for. When Dave returns later to woo Audrey (also, incidentally, to pick up Felix), he learns a chaperone has dropped out for a field trip to Pleasant Valley Farm. Dave volunteers to be near Audrey.

In the background, we've seen TV footage of war zone atrocities. We cut to a US Army testing facility, where two soldiers find a loose test subject from Project Regeneration chewing on a scientist's neck. They kill the subject and report it, only to discover that another sector is dealing with a large-scale breach.

The kids cheer on the field trip school bus as several military vehicles race past them. At Pleasant Valley Farm, Teddy McGiggle surprises the kids with a visit. The escaped test subjects meander to the nearest area with people: Pleasant Valley Farm. 

This movie is efficient in doling out a ton of information. The sense of humor works for me. It's not a total laugh riot, but it's consistent. Dave continuing to call Audrey Miss Caroline is a good bit. Also, Miss Caroline quotes Neil Diamond as inspiration.

Tess is a fantastic mother to Felix. She's taught him healthy coping strategies for dealing with moody people of any age. Also, a five-year-old Australian child saying "tofu" is a delight.

Alexander England's Dave is a frustrating and familiar character — the 30-something musician who never figured out how to do anything other than make music. His daddy issues come out most prominently in his hilarious and direct lyrics.

Lupita Nyong'o is flat as a kindergarten teacher. She is tremendous once she takes over as the only one keeping everyone together. She also sings and plays ukelele — I dare you not to fall in love with her.

Josh Gad is, as always, the weak link here. He has only ever made anything he's in worse. But I digress.

The zombie special effects are impressive! They're not the main feature, but they get the job done.

I'll admit, seeing echidnas made me giggle. I did a school project on them in 7th grade, and believe it or not, it had nothing to do with Sonic the Hedgehog!

Though this movie verges on cute more than good, it's still an emotional and satisfying watch.
