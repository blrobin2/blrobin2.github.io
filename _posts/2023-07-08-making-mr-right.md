**Rating:** 3/5

Dating in the 80s — ain’t it a drag? But when consultant Frankie Stone (Ann Magnuson) gets the opportunity to refine the personality of an android named Ulysses (John Malkovich) to appeal more to women, she finds herself drawn to him

However, Ulysses’ developer, Jeff Peters (also John Malkovich), is having a hard time accepting that his prized work is getting in touch with its feminine side when all he wants is for Ulysses to go to space

So funny! I haven’t laughed out loud at a movie like this in ages. John Malkovich is the greatest straight man

Yes, the “battle of the sexes” trope from the 80s is tired — the film can satirize it without abandoning it

Similarly, the “fish out of water” trope was way overused in the 80s — the movie doesn’t rise above it, but it doesn’t annoy me that much. That said, the mall scenes in the second act get pretty tedious

Overall, a charming rom-com

<b>Stray Thoughts</b>
* Keith Haring heels!
* Every delivery of “My god!” from Malkovich is perfect
* The “New Jersey” soap opera is pretty funny
* “It takes a man this sensitive to understand your needs.”
* The Parent Trap playing at the theater — another movie in which one actor plays dual roles
* Where else do you go to experience the real world, except the mall?
