**Rating:** 2/5

In rare form, they watch a Gumby TV episode called Robot Rumpus before the movie. I'll provide riffs I liked from both in this review.

* One of my classmates died in the kiln today
* Habitat Against Humanity
* Thank goodness for the internal genitalia

<i>The Screaming Skull </i>is another classic poster I had to remember not to watch because it's an <i>MST3K</i> episode.

Incidentally, a 2004 rerun of this episode was the last time <i>MST3K</i> broadcast on cable television.

* Thank you, and good night
* Oh great, ebola
* Something's staying crunchy, even in milk!
* Martin Luther is nailing each thesis individually
* If Ed Wood had directed <i>Rules of the Game</i>
