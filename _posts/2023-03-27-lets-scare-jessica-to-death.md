**Rating:** 4/5

Masking your emotions may hide the problem from those who may do you harm — isn’t that why we learn to mask in the first place? — but if let ourselves believe this is who we really are, we can lose sense of ourselves 

Part of how we learn who we are is by voicing it out loud to people you trust. And when you’re in a place with only a couple of voices, you may not have much opportunity — so much so that you may invite a stranger to stay just to have someone else to talk to

Zohra Lampert Is brilliant in this, eschewing your typical “hysterical woman” performance for something that feels genuine, that feels like a person who really wants to be okay and is in a place with such a small number of people that she can’t figure out if she is okay or not

I spent so much of this movie feeling uneasy, feeling like I was inside Jessica’s world and trapped within the walls of her perception

Very unassuming movie on the outside, but a great subjective narrator experience
