**Rating:** 2/5

One of my favorite MST3Ks

* This is the hippest Red Lobster I've been to
* It's a little late for acting lessons, they started filming already!
* Hey! The cops ate my Chiclets
* I'm as hetero as the next guy 
* Oh, they're draining the blinker light fluid
* [spills milk] don't cry over this, okay?
* Oops, I accidentally tied up one of our gang
* Ah, the Blue Ridge Mountains of Chicago
* I found some roots and grubs, we could survive here for weeks!
* And now I'm going to shave your mustache 
* George Leeland didn't commit suicide. I did
* Father, I had three impure thoughts last week... about you!
* He's beating up a milkman, he hates people in uniform
