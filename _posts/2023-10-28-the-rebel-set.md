One of my favorite MST3Ks

- This is the hippest Red Lobster I've been to
- It's a little late for acting lessons, they started filming already!
- Hey! The cops ate my Chiclets
- I'm as hetero as the next guy
- Oh, they're draining the blinker light fluid
- [spills milk] don't cry over this, okay?
- Oops, I accidentally tied up one of our gang
- Ah, the Blue Ridge Mountains of Chicago
- I found some roots and grubs, we could survive here for weeks!
- And now I'm going to shave your mustache
- George Leeland didn't commit suicide. I did
- Father, I had three impure thoughts last week... about you!
- He's beating up a milkman, he hates people in uniform
