#### Stray Thoughts / Spoilers

- Anna Farris sings this theme song in <i>Lost in Translation</i>
- Stromberg's lair is iconic
- I keep seeing Richard Kiel in things. Specifically, <i>MST3K</i> episodes.
- Mankiewicz didn't write this script — you can tell because it's not full of overt racism and double entendres
- Metal-teethed vampires sound like a cool idea
- They mentioned Bond's dead wife finally!
- MI6 setting up office in Egyptian ruins is the silliest these movies have been
- Bond: "The slides are useless." Proceeds to look at slides and get useful info
- Jaws uses a lot of tongue when he's going in for the neck bite. A little hickey before death?
- "Let them get to shore and then kill them." Yes, don't try to kill them in your isolated sea fortress.
- The most memorable Bond car — it turns into a submarine! So silly, I love it
- Bond making a <i>Candid Camera</i> joke feels uncomfortable — I don't like believing he knows about television
- Giving Bond an ensemble to work with helps the finale's pacing
- The score had a sexy sax as one of the sharks wiggled
- The gay sailor show-tune version of the theme at the end is icing
