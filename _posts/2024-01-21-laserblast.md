**Rating:** 2/5

The final episode with Trace Beaulieu, so the last Dr. Forrester episode and the last time he voices Crow. His dad, Jack Beaulieu, shows up as the elderly version of Dr. Forrester.

When they made this episode, they weren't sure if this would be their last, so they made it so it could be a series finale. And what a nightmare ending it would have been!

Thankfully, Sci-Fi picked them up, and we got most of the best Mike episodes.

This episode is probably the best Mike episode from the Comedy Central era. You can tell the writers put their whole pussy into writing this one.

Crow keeps insinuating Mike is a stoner.

Maybe I'm a big fucking idiot, but I like the turtle aliens

* And action!
* Looks like Trent Reznor ran out of gas
* Edward CD-Player Hand
* — Good shooting, Zanthar — Thanks, Denise
* Help! A giant bong is attacking me!
* I'm pretty sure this is the long version of whatever the heck song it is
* Everything is hush, hush, sweet Charlotte!
* Wow, if there was ignorant talk radio in the 70s, I sure would listen to it
* This makes me glad rural America is dying
* I'd like to call my horse with no name, but it doesn't have a name
* Someone threw away a perfectly good arm remover!
* Yes! Yahweh In a Can!
* Good thing my slacks have memory
* Yes, teens love their cake pool parties
* I shot the me, but I didn't shoot the other guy
* Allllrighty then
* This movie is comprised solely of second-unit footage
* Who's the well-lit person in the back?
* Save the pine air fresheners!
* Could Leonard Maltin be wrong, and this isn't worth 2.5 stars?
