**Rating:** 3/5

Two women leave to go to a concert, but a group of sickos pick them up and torture them

I didn’t know that this was a partially lost film because projectionists cut up copies as they played them

Fucked up music queues — the goofy comedy music as they take the knocked-out women and stuff them in the trunk — add to that the cutaways to the inept cops

The first two acts are a nightmare — the third act is straight-up Home Alone
