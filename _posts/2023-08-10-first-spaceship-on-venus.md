**Rating:** 3/5

* the goofy desert?
* dear diary, today I became a diary
* ðŸŽµthis is the day the teddy bears fly to Venus
* stop that nutty horn section!
* we secretly replaced their planet with Folgers Crystals
* Go ahead, I sit at the right hand of the devil!
* I am filled with life, get to know me, friends!

Tom Servo's sarcasm drive set on random is pretty funny

I'm with Crow, I actually like the movie! The effects are hit or miss, but some of them are cool. It kind of feels like a classic <i>Star Trek</i>. I wanna track down the non-dubbed, non-<i>MST3K</i> version
