**Rating:** 3.5/5

The choice to blend Poe and Lovecraft yields dividends. The story requires a lot of exposition, but also has more energy throughout than most of the other Poe cycle films. Overall, a little clunky, but it all comes together in the end

<b>Stray Thoughts</b>
* The first movie to use the Necronomicon!
* Debra Paget's last film :(
* Vincent Price gets so many jokes in this, i love it
