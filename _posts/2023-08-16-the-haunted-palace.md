The choice to blend Poe and Lovecraft yields dividends. The story requires a lot of exposition, but also has more energy throughout than most of the other Poe cycle films. Overall, a little clunky, but it all comes together in the end

<b>Stray Thoughts</b>

- The first movie to use the Necronomicon!
- Debra Paget's last film :(
- Vincent Price gets so many jokes in this, i love it
