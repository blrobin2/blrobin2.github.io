Momo was born under an unlucky star. Her mom ran off with another man. Her dad abandoned her at an orphanage. She's only dated losers. Now, she finds out she only has six months left to live.

She goes on a date with her fiance, Keisuke, who asks her to invest in his company. She gives him the news about her diagnosis, and he makes sure she'll still give him the money before she dies.

Later in the park, she encounters Ms. Devil Girl Succubus, VP of Sales and Marketing for Hell, who offers to grant Momo one wish in exchange for her soul.

The film is a pinku sendup of <i>Bedazzled</i>. The sex scenes in hell are the most interesting ones, just because there's attention to set design and angles. The 00s clothing and makeup are such a nostalgia trip.

This movie is surprisingly fun and cute.
