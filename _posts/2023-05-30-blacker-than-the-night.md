Four women in various states of undress live in a house together. One of the women learns that she inherits the house and a substantial sum from her recently deceased aunt, with the condition that she cares for her cat Bequer 

The women are less than thrilled about the cat — described as blacker than the night (hey that’s the name of the movie!) — but the opportunity is too valuable to ignore, especially when rent and space is a major consideration

While living there, they hear a voice in the garden calling for Bequer, but they can’t figure out who it is. Eventually, the women find Bequer dead, supposedly locked in the cellar and starved

Soon after the death, the women start dying one after another, each seeing the dead aunt just before something happens to her

It’s pretty tame and predictable but the cinematography is pretty great, especially when it goes psychedelic
