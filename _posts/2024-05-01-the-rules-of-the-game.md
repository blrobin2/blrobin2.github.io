<blockquote>
<i>Sensitive hearts, faithful hearts,
Who shun love whither it does range,
Cease to be so bitter:
Is it a crime to change?
If Cupid was given wings,
Was it not to flitter?</i>
<b>Beaumarchais. Le Mariage de Figaro, Acte IV. Scène X.</b></blockquote>
<blockquote><i>— Cornell, put an end to this farce!
</i><i>— Which one, my lord?</i></blockquote>
From <i>The Exterminating Angel</i> to <i>Fraiser</i>, this movie has its fingerprints everywhere. Every moment moves so effortlessly. The camera is fluid and adds to the comedic timing. It's a social satire that uses the universal experience of love to ground the story.

I don't like how they kill all those rabbits, though :(
