The difference between Tommy Wiseau’s <i>The Room</i> and everything he did after is that once he is “in” on the joke, the joke isn’t funny anymore, because he doesn’t know what made it funny in the first place

Similarly, when a filmmaker makes a “legitimate” movie in the style of a “bad” movie, they use it as an excuse to cop out on fleshing out the movie beyond its basics because “it’s supposed to be bad”

I think a lot of people my age watch this movie with the same nostalgic eyes that makes them love <i>Hook</i> or <i>Space Jam</i> — I’m guilty of loving the latter, so no judgment, love what you love
