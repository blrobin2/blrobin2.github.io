Thank you, Y.K. Kim and Dragon Sound. "Friends" will never leave my head.

* 80s guys wait patiently for the 80s to begin.
* Notes of oak, sage, plastic bag, switchblade, very nice!
* And now, motorcycle cocaine ninjas take communion.
* Friendship gets me hot!
* Pack it in, people! Pre-natal yoga has this space in 10 minutes.
* They left a note on our car. We're obligated to fight them to the death.
* Hush now, it's ninja nap time.
* Jim's new suit did not bring the eternal joy they'd hoped for.
* — Boss, everybody's dead. — That's exactly what I had to report on my first night working at the cemetery.
