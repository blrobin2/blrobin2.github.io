Thank you, Y.K. Kim and Dragon Sound. "Friends" will never leave my head.

- 80s guys wait patiently for the 80s to begin.
- Notes of oak, sage, plastic bag, switchblade, very nice!
- And now, motorcycle cocaine ninjas take communion.
- Friendship gets me hot!
- Pack it in, people! Pre-natal yoga has this space in 10 minutes.
- They left a note on our car. We're obligated to fight them to the death.
- Hush now, it's ninja nap time.
- Jim's new suit did not bring the eternal joy they'd hoped for.
- — Boss, everybody's dead. — That's exactly what I had to report on my first night working at the cemetery.
