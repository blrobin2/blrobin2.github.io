In his dreams, Paul sees a woman with sharp teeth and mysterious eye-like symbols

He, his girlfriend, and some other wealthy friends are sailing near Spain when a storm dashes their boat into the rocks, shipwrecking them in a hostile village of fish-like monsters — monsters who chase them down to sacrifice them to the god they serve: Dagon

The acting is pretty bad, and the story is almost non-existent, with just enough peppered into service what is mostly a movie of Paul running around performing stunt fight moves they could teach the actor in a day

The third act goes hard on the gore. Being a Brian Yuzna production, the practical effects look good and wet, but the CGI was just too ambitious for 2001, especially on whatever micro-budget they made this

I wasn't expecting much — if this had a little more meat on its bones, it could've been a campy good time — thankfully, we have <i>Re-Animator</i> and <i>From Beyond</i>

#### Stray Thoughts

- what is it with everyone getting ulcers in movies?
- At least one of the fish guys had to be modeled after Marty Feldman
