<b>COPS SEEK SEWER PSYCHO</b>

Ramon, the baby alligator, gets flushed down the toilet, just like in the urban legends. Twelve years later, cops are finding dead dogs and gnawed-off limbs in the sewage intake

Meanwhile, Gutchel (Sydney Lassick), a pet store owner, is trafficking puppies for Slade Pharmaceutical. When his supply runs low, he takes to the sewers. But like Nedry in <i>Jurassic Park</i> or Beverly Powers in <i>Jaws</i>, the bastard gets them

Officer David Madison (Robert Forester pre-hair plugs) is on the case!

The alligator stunts and effects in this look great! The movie goes all out — the almost satirical script, the charming acting performances, the wild set pieces (alligator ripping through a wedding is inspired) — they all elevate this above "just another Jaws rip-off" or creature feature

<b>Stray Thoughts</b>

- Baby gators are so cute, but why would they sell those to kids? I know they did IRL, but why??
- Little Yorkies too?!
- "<i>jaws</i> meets <i>chud</i> meets <i>soylent green</i>"
- a guy being chomped and wrestled by an alligator left the audience unphased
- Robert Forester wrote all the "receding hairline" jokes to humanize his character and because his hairline was, in fact, receding
- Marisa is the girl who won Ramon but never finds out
- I'm already terrified of the sewer, at least how they portray it in movies — so sludgy and gross! Add a gator, and I'm losing it, just barfing with anxiety. Exception: the 90s <i>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</i> movies made the sewers look cool as hell
- Oh, the explosions also pop off
