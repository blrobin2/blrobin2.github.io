**Rating:** 3.5/5

Simón Andreu looks like a hot Nathan Fielder

The Morricone score actually makes the film feel cheaper at times. It’s also really good at other points, though. It’s weird

Laying in bed at night and reading comics: I haven’t seen that before in a giallo!

This is some next level gaslighting, like everyone is doing it for one reason or another
