**Rating:** 2/5

A movie about a gay con man trying to hook up with a lesbian librarian.

Wow, I kind of hate this! If I had directed this movie, it would have ended with the music man crucified in the town square.

I like how they black out the background before ending the scene like it's on stage. The cinematography is hit or miss, depending on the song. The Madam Librarian, a disgusting song, looks great.

FUCK SHIPOOPI. This movie is cursed.
