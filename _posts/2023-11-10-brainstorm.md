**Rating:** 3/5

Dr. Michael Brace (Christopher Walken) is on a research team. They are working on an interface that records and replays the subject's sensory and emotional experiences. The team includes his ex-wife, Karen (Natalie Wood), and the brilliant Dr. Lillian Reynolds (Louise Fletcher).

The military intercepts the project and assigns a man to conduct independent research with the interface.

When Dr. Reynolds has a heart attack, she uses what little power she has to wear the interface and record her death. Michael tries to rewatch it, but a military spy dies while tapping the encounter.

Michael persists in trying to watch the recording because he saw it continued after Dr. Reynolds' death. Michael can be the first to experience death and survive. The military, though, won't let Michael through without a fight.

The movie conveys the switch from reality to the hyperreality of the interface by switching between 35mm and 70mm film. The director uses the 70mm film for the scenes inside the interface, wanting the experience to be more real than real. I found it obnoxious.

There's a contagious optimism at the heart of the movie. It's encouraging to witness scientists challenging the military-industrial complex and developing technology that fosters deeper human connections.

As a film, this has multiple problems. The structure itself is a mess. The cast is great, but they mostly make blank stares throughout the movie.

Still, the tech stuff was pretty fun, and the opening credits were bonkers with extravagant patterns.

Gordy getting a tape of someone having sex and looping the orgasm is the realest person in the movie. Yes, it nearly kills him and forces him into early retirement. I'll be goddamned if he wouldn't say it was worth it. ðŸ«¡
