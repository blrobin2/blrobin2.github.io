<b><a href="https://boxd.it/qBmUY/detail">Anti-Criterion Challenge 2024 | 35/52 | Music documentary from a genre that isn't modern pop or classic rock</a></b>

The doc intercuts footage of Gil Scott-Heron and his Midnight Band performing live with solo interviews with Scott-Heron on his worldviews.

Most people my age heard about Gil Scott-Heron through his 2011 collaboration with Jamie xx. I was lucky to hear Winter in America during college when I listened to the 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.

So, let's get this out of the way: I hate music documentaries. I don't enjoy watching live performances in any context other than live. And while Scott-Heron is a brilliant innovator and intuitive poet, I'm not the biggest fan of his music.

That said, Gil Scott-Heron is a charismatic talker, and his journey into poetry is the essential groundwork that led to hip-hop. I found my attention focused more on his speaking than I expected.

I wouldn't have watched this doc if not for the Anti-Criterion Challenge. This movie would be a solid introduction to Gil Scott-Heron if you've never heard of himâ€”you get all the hits. Otherwise, you know whether or not this appeals to you.
