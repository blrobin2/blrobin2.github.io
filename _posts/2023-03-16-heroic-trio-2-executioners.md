Between the first and second movie, the world became a nuclear apocalyptic wasteland — no biggie

Is this a critique of communism? Folks wearing red bands on their arms, and one dude looks a lottt like Lenin, another with a big ol Stalin mustache

The plot has to do with water access, and the belief that there is clean water being hidden somewhere, and boy does this plot. Political conspiracy, suicide bombers, prison camps… its all a little serious

It’s still got the occasional fight — more gunfights than king fu — but not the balls-to-the-wall insanity of the first one

Don’t get me wrong, it still has some fun goofiness, especially in the last 30 minutes. It’s just a pretty different movie for most of its runtime

So many exploding bodies!
