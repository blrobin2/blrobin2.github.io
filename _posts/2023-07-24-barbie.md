**Rating:** 3.5/5

As safe as this movie is, it manages to fit a ton of humor and genuinely emotional moments. It does its best to grapple with the legacy of Barbie, and it’s about as successful as you could expect from a corporate-blessed product

What makes this good is the search for humanity at the core of its story and the way it arrives at a place of both uncertainty and confidence — that we don’t have to know who we are or define meaning by our roles at work or home; we can just be. A world where we could feel all feel safe enough to do that would be pretty radical
