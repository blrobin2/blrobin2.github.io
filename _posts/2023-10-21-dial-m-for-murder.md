<blockquote><i>— Do you really believe in the perfect murder?
— Yes, absolutely. On paper, that is. And I think I could plan one better than most people, but I doubt if I could carry it out.
— Oh? Why not?
— Because, in stories, things usually turn out the way the author wants them to, and in real life, they don’t.

Tony invites Charles over under the pretense of purchasing his car.

Talk exchanged, crimes uncovered, and fingerprints captured, Tony entraps Charles. Tony coerces Charles into a plot to murder Tony’s wife, Margot, because Margot is having an affair with Mark, an author. Tony will also pay Charles for it.

It’s no fun if everything goes according to plan, so Tony has to think on his feet and concoct a new plan.

The first act is perfect fun — watching every detail unfold as we learn what type of story we’re getting into.

The movie loses me a bit after the intermission, but once Mark tries to solve the case himself, the drama picks up. But it’s all so talk-heavy, it’s hard to keep the energy up.

It’s the cinematography that makes this one stand out to me. The way it uses the apartment space to find dramatic angles and compositions is so satisfying.

The lighting also creates beautiful compositions and striking images.

I enjoyed this a good bit.
