**Rating:** 2.5/5

In the 1970s, Harris (Richard Lynch) brings Cynthia (Colbie Smulders prototype Jennifer Rubin) into his cult along with over 20 others to partake in a mass suicide — "the final break with the old world.” He douses everyone, one by one, in gasoline and lights a fire, causing the whole house to explode. When the fire department arrives, they find one survivor: Cynthia. They rush her to the hospital, where she remains in a coma for 13 years

When she awakens, it’s the 80s, baby, and she doesn’t remember what happened to her. Her psychiatrist, Dr. Karmen (Bruce Abbott of <i>Re-Animator</i> fame), suggests she join a borderline personality support group — not necessarily for the diagnosis, but for her repressed memories with the intent of accessing them and knowing what went down the day of the fire

While in recovery, she begins to see visions of Harris (sometimes as he was and other times charred from the fire) of the day of the fire — he beckons her to fulfill her promise and join them. When she refuses, it seems that he starts taking the other members of the BPD support group

No surprise, the representation of BPD in this movie is inaccurate at best — at worst, grossly misrepresented for the sake of having a room of “kookie characters.” Jennifer Rubin plays her tortured role well and should count among the scream queens for the harsh wails she emits here. In her support group is Lana, played by 80s indie darling and prolific voice actor E.G. Daily, whom I think gives an empathetic performance compared to her castmates

The special effects are hit or miss — the fire stunts are well-executed, and some of the smaller, “stabbier” scenes are convincing. Richard Lynch’s post-fire makeup is probably the weakest — sort of ironic (is it?), considering Richard Lynch lit himself on fire while on LSD in the 70s

Overall, it doesn’t do much for me. It’s competently pieced together, but I wouldn’t go out of my way to watch this, though
