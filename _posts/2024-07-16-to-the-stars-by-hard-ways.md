**Rating:** 3/5

This cut of the movie has an hour removed. Thanks, Sandy Frank. Probably for the best â€” I don't know if I could stand a 2.5 hour episode of <i>MST3K</i>.

I like the aesthetic of the movie a lot. It's slow in places, which doesn't bode well for the full-length. Like <i>Phase IV</i>, I want to watch the original and compare. But this was so wild and went so many unexpected places.
