<i>April 1973</i>

Hazy, ethereal wandering around the island — trees and rocks crop out in odd shapes like people on the horizon — flowers reaching out on rocky shores to the wind — a stone dropped down a mine shaft, a quiet splash

While observing the cracks in the stone walls, memory leaks through, encroaching on the desired loneliness

Lichen on the flowers, lichen on the scar across her stomach — the symbiotic relationship forms, the island collects her past, and the island offers up its memory in return

The movie feels like an adaptation of a walking simulator — if that sounds appealing, this is for you. Otherwise, you might go nuts waiting for the narrative to unfold

There are a couple of choices that I don't think work, but for the most part, I like the vibes

#### Stray Thoughts

- Reading a book by candlelight looks nice but is hard on the eyes
- Love the color grading — the reds look so warm and rich — the older tech looks of its time
