What do you do when you just know someone is going to make your life suck but you don’t know how to give them up? When they’re on, they make life feel so much simpler. But in a single moment, they turn away and give you nothing, leaving you to wonder what you could have done wrong or how you could have prevented it: they remind you of how painfully complicated it all is, and how distant they actually are from you

Ask for another I love you, and maybe they will give one back. Or maybe they’ve changed their mind
