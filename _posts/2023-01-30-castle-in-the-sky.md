**Rating:** 3.5/5

The scene where all the pirates flirt with and confess their love to a child is… uncomfortable

The best part of this movie is the world building, the actual plot is pretty meh for me. I’m a sucker for “lost ancient city of advanced technology” settings when done well, and that’s where this shines the most

Not my favorite Miyazaki — it lives in a similar place as Howl’s Moving Castle for me — but still an enjoyable experience
