**Rating:** 3.5/5

The police in 1970’s Italy knew not to group trans prostitutes with criminal perverts — a lesson contemporary American Republicans could learn

“Naïve but macabre” is how I want to be described after death

The slow tracking shot with the guy in the yellow jacket — it’s only a few seconds, but it adds such a surreal quality to the chase, and gives that little bit of insight into the pursuer’s mental state

While this is fairly straight-forward giallo, complete with J&B Whiskey bottles, it’s tight and Tony Musante is a perfect lead for the genre
