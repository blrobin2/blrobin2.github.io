A meteor shower flies across the sky. George Gardner and his son David lay out in the yard, stargazing. Helen comes out to put David to bed. David talks of becoming an astronaut when he grows up, and his father eagerly encourages it.

Later that night, a thunderstorm wakes David. He goes to the window. Up on the hill, he sees dancing lights. A strange object gently descends from the sky and lands just beyond view.

David tells his parents. They suggest ball lightning or a ship from the nearby military base where George works. But David knows better, so his father agrees to check it out in the morning.

While David prepares for school, George returns from checking the landing site. He is still in his night robe and missing a slipper. David also notices an unexplained mark on the back of George's neck. George offers to show David what he saw over the hill, but his behavior concerns David.

Soon, David notices more people exhibiting similar behavior and the mark on the neck.

The movie follows the original script closely, leaning on updated effects and profanity to differentiate it from the 1953 version. The alien stuff starts standard, but it gets wacky once we see inside the alien ship (compliment).

This movie wouldn't exist if not for Wade Williams buying the rights for the original and funding this remake. It has no reason to exist beyond a millionaire's whims. The filmmakers still tried to make this entertaining.

The film is most fun when the possessed eat weird shit. Helen grabs a handful of raw beef, douses it in salt, and shoves it in her mouth. Mrs. McKeltch, the science teacher, swallows a frog.

The kid is watching <i>Lifeforce</i> on the TV at one point. I can't imagine his parents being okay with him watching the movie.

Karen Black plays the school nurse, and she's refreshing when she's on screen. She finds a deft balance of humor and sincerity â€” one of her greatest acting strengths.

Louise Fletcher, as the science teacher, is so unhinged.

I knew a kid growing up named David Gardner.

This movie isn't great, but I like parts of this more than Abel Ferrara's <i>Body Snatchers</i>, especially with how it handles the third act.
