The bassist from Spandau Ballet (Martin Kemp) makes out with his virgin princess girlfriend (Rebecca Ferratti). She leaves, and he falls asleep next to a beautiful waterfall â€” we've all been there, folks.

While he rests, three semi-nude women emerge from the woods. One puts an ankh necklace on him, which glows a 90s television blue. Another bares her fangs and draws blood from his neck.

Centuries pass. The guy, now a vampire, feels his virgin princess girlfriend's soul at a small college in an unnamed town. But the clock is ticking! The vampire will fall into an eternal sleep in three days. Her virgin princess soul is the only thing that will save him.

Charlotte (Alyssa Milano) is also a virgin, not a princess, but a girlfriend to a boy named Chris (Harold Pruett). The vampire will sew doubt in Charlotte's mind by giving her horny dreams about sex that Chris could never pull off. Once Charlotte falls out of love with her boyfriend, the vampire will make his move.

Can Charlotte choose between a horny boy and a horny centuries-old vampire? Or will she find her own path?

Film nerds may know director Anne Goursaud from her editing work with Francis Ford Coppola. As a director, she only directed direct-to-video erotica like this.

Alyssa Milano felt protected working with a woman director and taught her how to define nudity clauses in her contracts. It's worth teasing out these nuances when contemporary discourse is "boobs = male gaze."

That said, this isn't high art. It's like a Harlequin Romance. Charlotte has little consent throughout the movie. Chris spies on her changing, the vampire manipulates her in her sleep, and the photographer makes a move on her.

The score is by Joseph Williams, the lead singer of Toto and son of Barbara Ruick and John Williams. It sounds like every low-budget horror movie from the 90s. I need to find out if he's scored any Charles Band movies.

As erotica, this is tame but evocative. As a movie, it's a little silly. However, it's not a complete disaster.
