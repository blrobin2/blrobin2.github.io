I love how this movie looks! The costumes are so fun! There's a Death Star! They used the best headbutt sound effect, making me rub my head! But it's so boring!! The final fight is kind of cool, but it goes on way too long.

The riffing is marginally less racist than usual, as in they don't do accents (correction: 48 minutes in and the accents started. Damn it).

* Sir, you parked in the lobby—can you move your car?
* Why did you beat us up if you were just gonna blow up our ship?
* — Exterior heat rising! — How exterior heat rising is it?!
* And now to destroy what I'm told is your most populated and important city: this Himalayan mountain!
* We expect you to work hard, yet it appears you're hardly working!
