**Rating:** 2/5

I dictated this so sorry if it's nonsense, I'm tired

Joshua is a guy married to someone named Maya and she's pregnant with their child and then there's a raid and he's like no don't do it not yet we haven't found Amada, who is the creator of artificial intelligence... so we're in the middle of this war between AI and humans because AI detonated this nuke in a major metropolis — LA I guess LA, ground zero — and yeah they're at war now 

Joshua tried to call it off, but a ship blows up with his wife in it. Five years later he's moping around LA and then Allison Janey shows up like, "you've gotta find your wife," and he's like, "my wife is dead," "no, she isn't," then shows him a picture of his wife, that he totally believes like goddamn idiot

He's actually going to New Asia to try and find a major weapon that AI people have been developed, and since he was on the inside he has all of the plans. I guess he knows how to like navigate labs when he gets there. What he finds is a child

Joshua's got this kid and Allison Janey is looking for him. He supposed to kill the kid, but he wants the kid to help him find his wife, so I guess that's what the movie about

It's beautifully shot, and does great job of establishing place by giving us a lot of incidental footage of humans and AI coexisting in spaces. Sometimes they're just like hanging out at a bar, driving a car, listening to music or one scene where an AI is telling about a future of peace, and a great thing that is going to come and save them all

Problem? The script, dialogue, and third act in particular are a mess. I like Garrett Edwards' movie <i>Monsters</i>, I didn't love <i>Godzilla</i> and I didn't love <i>Rogue One</i>, and I don't think I love this either
