**Rating:** 2.5/5

A man in a mask is outside. “Honey, that’s the man who comes every night to kill us,” says the husband. May is understandably perplexed

Everyone keeps telling her she’s lucky to be alive, but don’t treat her like she’s in danger. May feels like she has to go it alone. Everyone gives advice that feels more like relationship advice than how to handle a stalker

“This is just the way things are now,” the movie refrains

Ultimately, the movie becomes both too overt and too abstract about what it’s trying to say. It has some ideas I like, and I think it manages to hold it together until the 3rd act. Still, I was engaged the whole time


<b>***Spoilers***</b>
* It has the same ending as <i>Men</i>
