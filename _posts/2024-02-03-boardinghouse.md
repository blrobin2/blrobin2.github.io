<i>Hoffman Boardinghouse, Sept 18, 1972</i>
Dr. Hoffman and his wife, leading authorities on telekinesis and the occult, are found dead on the night of their 16th-anniversary party

Their 13-year-old daughter, Debbie, witnessed their double suicide and had a nervous breakdown. The state submits her to a sanitarium

The couple who buys the house dies as well — Mr. Clark falls into his pool and drowns. Mrs. Clark puts her hand in the garbage disposal.

Hernan Royce buys the house and falls down the stairs

In 1982, we join Herman's nephew, Jim (director John Wintergate), who inherits the house. He puts an ad in the paper for young, single women to move in. He imagines women in his hot tub ripping each other's bikinis off.

Six women move into the boardinghouse. Later, a British woman named Debbie begs to move in.

Coincidence?? No, it's Debbie Hoffman.

What do you think is going to happen?

This movie is shameless with how many excuses it finds for nudity. It makes Evil Toons look tasteful by comparison.

Wintergate's wife, Kalassu, who plays Victoria, gets the lion's share of lines and scenes. Besides Wintergate, of course, who plays two parts and credits himself under an alias for the second.

It's so hard to evaluate SOV movies. They make it clear just how much 35mm helps a film without any effort on their part.

I love it when they use every video effect they can for no reason.

That said, this is dog shit. It cuts or fades mid-dialogue, and its B-roll is But, it's so funny (unintentionally) and weird (maybe intentionally), so I had fun.

I also had a glass of wine, so who knows?

#### Stray Thoughts/Spoilers

- Thank you, Bleeding Skull, for not giving me the 2.5-hour director cut
- Wild that they transferred this to 35mm for a theatrical release
- A warning noise for people so they can close their eyes
- A woman moaning over the digital opening credits
- What is the red blob on the screen? Is it supposed to be a ghost?
- That dude rips his intestines out
- Jim looks like diet Sting meets diet Malcolm McDowell
- Kitty!
- Knife through the hand
- "Bo Derek's competition!" yells one girl without provocation
- One girl imagines her head is an old man's, and she swallows a bloody tampon. She screams and presses her breasts against the show glass for some reason
- The women are borderline predatory when a guy shows up
- Blow dryer in the bath. Classic
- Jim demonstrates his psychic abilities with a bar of soap in the tub.
- After a nice bath, you have to do some inversion therapy
- Victoria's giant portrait of herself hangs over her bed.
- Debbie chooses chaos — puts an alien mask on and bangs a pot in Victoria's room
- And then a hand reaches through the bed??
- Thank god there's a graveyard to hide in. Or not — ghouls, I guess
- Someone is holding a pig's head covered in blood.
- Victoria's bed is now outside??
- She wakes up screaming and screaming... and screaming
- Woman on the run from rapist boyfriend...
- "Hey, what is this gun?" I laughed so hard
- Jim's vision of bikini ripping comes true
- Victoria's either learning telekinesis or how to withstand high G-forces (the breathing exercises are apparently identical)
- "You have a really sexy body, you know that?" says one of the roommates to Jim.
- The gun spinning on its own (through the Vogue magazine)
- The psychic killer makes a topless girl bleed out of every orifice.
- Boy butt!
- Debbie tending to her flowers
- Hand cuts always mess me up, even if they look fake
- I started cooking, but the band played, Victoria had more weirdo dreams, and folks had a psychic fight in colorful fog. It ruled.
