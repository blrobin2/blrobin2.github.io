**Rating:** 3/5

Four kids play a game that gets out of hand,
and one of the girls, Kelly, falls out of a window to her death. The others swear to secrecy

Six years later, the prom is coming, and the killers are receiving mysterious notes, threatening calls, and shards of a broken mirror

One of the earliest and most influential American slashers, coming out just two months after <i>Friday the 13th,</i> the film has a slower pace and emphasizes character development over who left after kills as the means for the audience to guess the killer

As a result, the movie is not all that exciting of a movie to watch. Besides one iconic kill at the prom, the rest are tame, even by that time's standards. The teen drama elements are solid, though, and the disco-themed dance is delightful

Overall, I say skip this one and watch <i>Hello Mary Lou: Prom Night II</i>, which, in classic horror form, has next to nothing to do with the original

Also, this movie has too many:
— "Do [uncomfortable thing]"
— "But you're my sister!"
