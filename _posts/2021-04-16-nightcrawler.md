This movie puts me on edge like few movies can

I love how it builds, and how effortless and organic the action/driving sequences feel in the context of the story

Riz Ahmed continuing his trend of making me cry, Jake Gyllenhaal of making the buggiest eyes he can

There are some moments near the end that I think are too on the nose, but they donâ€™t ruin the movie for me
