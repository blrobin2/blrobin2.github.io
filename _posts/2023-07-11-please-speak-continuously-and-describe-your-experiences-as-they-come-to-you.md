The more Brandon Cronenberg I watch, the more I feel like he needs a co-writer or collaborator of some sort. He has the start of some good ideas and visuals but you feel the loss in translation to screen

Coolest visual: the face blossoming open to a black skull crying. But also, kind of silly-looking. You see what I mean?
