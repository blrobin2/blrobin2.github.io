Another visually striking film from Ptushko. The costumes, set pieces, and colors are so satisfying! He makes live action movies that feel like classic Disney animations. MST3K saw Corman distributed it in the USA and assumed it sucks.

- 27 brides for 27 brothers
- Still, it's a nice day to he out
- I never knew Arabia was so Russian
- Sinbad tested, god approved
- Looks like god picked up a couple extra bucks doing voiceovers
- They also have a dog with Alan Alda's head, it's pretty neat
- That ceiling octopus really helps with the circulation
