**Rating:** 1/5

I am doing something no one has ever considered doing while watching this movieâ€”yeah, don't tell dad, but I'm smoking some reefer. That's right, I'm lighting up that righteous bush, and lord help me, I feel the violent sensations and madness descending on me nowâ€¦

This opening crawl is interminable!

Thank god they watched the color version â€” it looks terrible ðŸ˜Œ

* Warning, during this movie you may experience emotions and sensations. We apologize for causing you to feel.
* I'm going to read this letter to you, even though it gets a little steamy.
* The message? True love conquers all :)
