**Rating:** /5

<blockquote><i>— God has mercy for all his creatures
— Not all of them</i></blockquote>Found this as<i> It Happened at Nightmare Inn</i>

Two sisters who run an inn begin punishing the guests who don’t fit their strict Catholic morals. But, when a sister of one of the now-missing guests keeps poking around, things start to unravel

The English version was edited for content, and poorly — it cuts right before any nudity or gore and on to the next scene. It's so bad that I don’t know parts of the plot because of it, so I am deferring a rating until I can find the uncut movie

Great soundtrack! The jazz is smooth; the organ is sinister

Overall, I liked the approach here — <i>X</i> must have taken at least some inspiration from this
