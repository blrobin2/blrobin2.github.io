**Rating:** 3.5/5

Two truckers ride into town looking for ramen and meet Tampopo, who needs help perfecting her ramen recipe. The truckers take her under their wing, along with a few other ragtag dudes

I feel like if I wrote down everything said, I would be able to make ramen at home, but maybe the movie just made me believe in Tampopo’s ascension from amateur to true ramen chef

The horny interludes were off-putting at first, but as it went on, their comedic intent became clearer. That said, passing the egg yolk back and forth in their mouths was a lot to handle

I didn’t feel the magical love that others seem to feel for this, but I did enjoy it. Maybe it needs to be watched when I’m hungry and/or with friends?
