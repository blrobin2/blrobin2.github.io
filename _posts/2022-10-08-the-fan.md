**Rating:** 3/5

The letters from the fan feel authentic, with their delusional “everyone clapped” asides, and how adoration turns to violent insults the moment rejection occurs. Lauren Bacall is perfectly cast as someone similar to her in acclaim and status — whose resilience and fear comes from years of dealing with men who promise the world but have nothing to give but their own delusions and insecurities

The musical numbers and the extended sequences with her ex-husband are hokey and slow down the movie, even if they’re technically “thematically relevant”

Even with these flaws, I think this is an underrated thriller and a great Lauren Bacall performance
