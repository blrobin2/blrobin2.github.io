**Rating:** 1.5/5

The observers!

This movie is gay! (compliment)

* Well, this is as close as we can get to the horses. They don't like us.
* Jessica doesn't charge anything! And the devil's built right in!
* Jessica, may I scare you to death?
* If you value your soul, do not open this chest, as it contains my stuff
* But who's going to milk the horses?
* Shh big boys don't cry
* I'm new to this. Is this sexual tension?
* Everyone pretend you don't have blood!
