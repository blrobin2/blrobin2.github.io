The observers!

This movie is gay! (compliment)

- Well, this is as close as we can get to the horses. They don't like us.
- Jessica doesn't charge anything! And the devil's built right in!
- Jessica, may I scare you to death?
- If you value your soul, do not open this chest, as it contains my stuff
- But who's going to milk the horses?
- Shh big boys don't cry
- I'm new to this. Is this sexual tension?
- Everyone pretend you don't have blood!
