<b>Stray Thoughts/Spoilers</b>
* I sing "ðŸŽµ For British Eyes Only" from Arrested Development on a weekly basis
* RIP Bernard Lee :(
* Flowers on Tracy's grave!
* "I trust you had a pleasant FRIGHT," says unnamed Blofeld-esque villain in his best Cryptkeeper impersonation
* Carole Bouquet! I remember her from That Obscure Object of Desire
* Bouquet gives an authentic chuckle to Bond's joke, "I love a drive in the countryside."Â 
* Bill Conti's score is dopey
* Bibi says someone other than Bond is beautiful and he calls her fickle
* The sound design is so cartoonish! It undermines their "realistic Bond" efforts
* Kicking the car off the cliff was ice cold
* I love the fake underwater footage â€” uncanny valley / perfume ad vibes
* I wanted the parrot to have secrets :(
* The rock climbing scene is tense!
* Again, ensemble for finale helps pacing tremendously
* Melina's so cool
* I never get tired of watching dummies fall from high places. Almost serene
* Bond throwing the Maguffin off the cliff!
* Parrot flirting with Margaret Thatcher surrogate. This is hell
