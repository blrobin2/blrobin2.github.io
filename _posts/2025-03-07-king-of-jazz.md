<i>King of Jazz</i> is a musical revue. The film includes musical numbers, sketches, and an animated sequence created by Walter Lantz and Bill Nolan, who also created Woody Woodpecker.

The film is a first in several categories and an early adopter in others. It uses the volatile two-color Technicolor process—a compelling challenge for the presentation of Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue, as the two colors, red and green, do not make blue. I love the turquoise they were able to achieve as their second tone. It's so pleasant.

It is Bing Crosby's first appearance. The animated sequence is the first Technicolor animated cartoon segment, featuring a cameo from Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks's first creation, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit.

The movie feels equal parts quaint and progressive — the innocent love stories and the queer characters. The costumes are so elaborate, especially in the wedding dress bit. The sets are massive — a mainstay of the time that we have lost. So, while these sets would not have excited audiences at the time, they're pretty stunning to see today.

The Rhapsody in Blue intro has, uh, not aged well. Also, what's with Mr. King of Jazz showing up holding a black child? For what it's worth, at least we don't get full-blown minstrel blackface.

The Melting Pot number is so sinister when they melt the people down!

Cut the Fish Story song! It's so dull.

I wouldn't call this exciting, but the revue has plenty of awe-inspiring dance numbers, and the film is an excellent time capsule, especially for an era of film that is mostly lost.
