**Rating:** 5/5

This film brought to life this period better than any movie I've seen. The visual storytelling is rich, and the performances are incredible. The first-person perspective adds so much to the subjective nature of Elwood and Turner's experiences. Words are failing me, so I'm gonna go cry a bit. This is one of the best-directed movies I've seen.
