<i>[joyless music] </i>plays over the opening credits, followed by an endless text scroll about the dangers of fear and how it creates mental illness and, therefore, criminality.

A former ventriloquist works for a mad scientist trying to resurrect the dead. The ventriloquist kills the scientist and assumes his identity.

This movie is pure exploitation â€” semi-nude women, animal violence (strangling a cat and eating its eyeball), and hack science run amuck. I guess it's also a loose adaptation of Poe's The Black Cat.

The movie has entertaining moments, but much of its runtime is tedious plotting. It's worth seeing if you enjoy "awesomely bad" movies. Otherwise, don't bother.
