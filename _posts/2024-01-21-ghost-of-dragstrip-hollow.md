What happens when you forego the plot and just stick some stuff teens like in an hour long movie? You create the prototype for the beach party movie 

* Drag racing down the LA river — wild to think it's been gone that long
* The kids shooting funs while playing their instruments
* The off-key flute and the parrot garbling are insanely annoying.
* A rock song called Charge that's just a ton of galloping sound effects
* With only 20 minutes left, we introduce the titular ghost. It's more of a monster tbh
* "This place is loaded with ectoplasm, isn't it?"
* I'm upset about how much more I enjoyed this when it became a haunted house story
* Okay it sucks again
