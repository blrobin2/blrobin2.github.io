<b>I wish I loved anything as much as Russ Meyer loved boobs</b>

Clint Ramsey is a gas station attendant who is irresistible to women. His wife, SuperAngel, demands he come home to fuck her but catches on that SuperLorna, a gas station patron, wants to fuck him too.

His wife threatens to leave him, so he jumps in his red truck to run home and give her a piece of his mind (and a piece of his ass as well — is that a sex euphemism?).

Angel trashes his truck, smashing it up with an axe. The neighbor calls the cops. The cop tells Clint to go back to work while the cop and SuperAngel fuck.
<blockquote><i>I ask myself. Is the fucking I get worth the fucking I get?</i></blockquote>SuperAngel laughs at the cop, so he kills her and decides to pin it on Clint. So Clint hits the road and tries to handle all the Super babes who come his way

Whip-fast editing keeps the energy high despite being too long for its concept.

The movie knows what it is and has a rigid formula, but still manages to surprise with the choices it makes with the story. The sense of humor is ridiculous, but it made me laugh.

The bathtub murder scene is so brutal — I don't know if it needed to be that graphic.

The climax drags on for a bit too long, but that's also part of the joke.

This was good! Color me impressed
