**Rating:** /5

* An exploitation flick about exploitation is such an outrageous gamble.
* Marguerite Pomerhn Derricks brought her choreography experience from this movie to such classics as <i>Donnie Darko</i>, <i>Step Brothers</i>, and <i>Tropic Thunder</i>.
* No one fucked on their period in 1995.
* Nomi says her mother is Italian, but she can't pronounce Versace. I smell an unreliable narrator.
* The heartwarming music swells over, "I chipped my tooth on a quaalude."
* A monkey wearing lipstick? Now THAT's comedy.
* Why is she dipping her fingers in the champagne and sucking on them?
* Do you know how you can recognize real art? Everyone's booing it.
