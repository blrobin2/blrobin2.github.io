**Rating:** 1.5/5

* I've looked at clouds from both sides joe
* its the days of wine and roses
* Paul never used to make deals with the devil before
* I told you if we skipped we'd get here faster
* It's called the New World Order, Paul
* I'm doing this for Jodie Foster, it's nothing personal

A young Les Van Cleef is surreal, I just assumed he was born an old cowboy. He looks like he exclusively attends noise shows
