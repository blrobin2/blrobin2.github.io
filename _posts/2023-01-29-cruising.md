Al Pacino and a dude walking in focus in the background, the faint out-of-focus line of meat hooks in the foreground: this is the most subtle the movie gets

I love the idea that dudes were/are regularly quoting Freud and Jung to each other as pickup lines

Seeing William Russ, the dad from <i>Boy Meets World, </i>was a trip

#### SPOILERS BELOW \_\*\*</b>

My only major gripe is the suggestion that Al Pacino maybe being attracted to men means that he can’t be attracted to Karen Allen anymore, but it doesn’t land anywhere conclusive

And I guess that’s the biggest complaint is the ambiguity, right? But in a post <i>Zodiac</i> world I think the tolerance for that is now higher
