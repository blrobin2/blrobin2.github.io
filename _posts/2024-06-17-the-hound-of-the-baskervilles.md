<blockquote><i>In England, there is no district more dismal than the vast expanse of primitive wasteland, the moors of Dartmoor in Devonshire.</i></blockquote>Sir Charles Baskerville runs through the foggy night, a howling chasing him. He makes it through the gate of the Baskerville estate but collapses in the garden, clasping his chest. A man emerges from the trees, reaching for Sir Charles' pocket watch. A voice calls out from Baskerville Hall, scaring the man off. Mrs. Barryman brings a lantern.

Cut to Mr. Barryman finishing the account for the coroner's court. They called Dr. Mortimer, who was at dinner with Miss Beryl Stapleton and her brother, Jack. Dr. Mortimer attributes Sir Charles' death to heart failure, perhaps caused by a needling worry he carried. When asked for clarification, Dr. Mortimer's wife, Jennifer, grabs his coat. Mr. Frankland interrupts to insist that someone murdered Sir Charles.

Big Ben strikes midnight in London as we venture to 221B Baker Street, where Dr. Watson reads of Sir Henry Baskerville's arrival from Canada to assume the title and estate of the late Sir Charles. Per Sherlock Holmes' request, Watson cuts the clipping from the newspaper. Why? Because Holmes believes that someone will murder Sir Henry.

Dr. Mortimer comes to Holmes, worried that someone will murder Sir Henry. Historically, every Baskerville who has inherited the estate has come to a violent end. Mortimer confides to Holmes what he had not to the coroner â€” that near Sir Charles' body were the footprints of a gigantic hound. He shows Holmes an old parchment he discovered in the house: Legend of the Hound of the Baskervilles.

Sherlock Holmes is on the case!

This film is one of the first Sherlock film adaptations to be based in the original period. Prior adaptations updated the story to a contemporary context.

For all the Basil Rathbone movies I've seen, this is the first Sherlock of his I've watched. My dad always complained about how dry they were, but this is right up my alley! He's much more energetic and funny than in some other roles.

The sets are top-notch, the mystery is (mostly) sound, and the action is well-choreographed. I can't say it was an exciting watch, but it was consistently engaging.
