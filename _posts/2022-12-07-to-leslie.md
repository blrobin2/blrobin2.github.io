**Rating:** 3/5

Andrea Riseborough carries the whole thing, her performance is as frustrating and uncomfortable as the material requires

Stephen Root is so miscast that the movie reads like a bad comedy when he’s on screen. Similarly, Marc Marin’s southern accent is… well, it’s just bad

I appreciate the intent behind this, but it ends up mostly being an “Oscar yelling” movie
