**Rating:** 1.5/5

TV's Frank's last episode :(

I love the alternative outs they had for him, but my favorite is where Arby's gives Frank a better offer, so he leaves

I watched <i>Cassandro</i> recently, which is about Luchador wrestling, so Santo (Sampson) plays into the plot.

* Someone taped over Seinfeld!
* Can they keep this pace up?
* I call, no tag backs!
* Ah jeez, I've been awake since 1890
* I dedicate this song to thorazine
* Beethoven, from the grave, renounces his great work
* Better review the rules of etiquette again
* Hey I got a load of vampires here!
* She's got combination skin: one part is fetid, the other is rotted
* We're out of blood, is Pepsi okay?
* Mom said you guys have to let me play
* I'll see you in hell! Actually I will, I'm down there often
* keystone vampires
* Hey, wrestling!
* You wanna untie me real quick before you die?
