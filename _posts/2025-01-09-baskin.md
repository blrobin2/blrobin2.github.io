<blockquote><i>Hell is not a place you go. You carry Hell with you at all times.</i></blockquote>

After some vague images, we meet our heroes, a group of shitty cops (the only kind there is, am I right?). One tells a story about how a trans woman tricked him. They harass the server for laughing at a joke and beat him up. A cop gets sick and sees a frog — an auspicious sign, I reckon.

Twenty minutes later, the cops get a call to go out to Inceagac. What awaits them? For one, more frogs. But we'll have to wait half the movie before they even arrive. Then….

I watched some of the director's shorts before this. If I can say anything, he likes gore—no need to motivate it, just scenes of grotesque violence for its own sake.

I'm reticent to call this a movie — just a whisper of character and story to paste together a parade of "pretty gross, yeah?" As a short film, this would be fine. But for a movie that depicts endless scenes of torture, the most brutal thing is that it's over 90 minutes long.
