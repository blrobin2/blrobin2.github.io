Michelle Yeoh is cool as hell and uncanny in her ability to be at the right place at the right time.

Tsui Hark has excellent comedic timing

It’s a bummer that the two women leads have to be adversaries. There’s plenty of conflict going on without the “women can’t work together” trope, but thankfully it doesn’t last too long

I wish they cut less during the fights. Everyone can clearly do the moves, so it just feels disjointed

Still, great stunts — and some really dangerous stuff with real glass that Hong Kong was doing at the time — lots of dudes flying, a lot of fun
