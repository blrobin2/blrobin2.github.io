I liked <i>Don’t Breathe</i>, I liked Jane Levy in it, and I’m going to see <i>Evil Dead Rise</i> tonight, so it seemed like I ought to check this out

I’m not an OG <i>Evil Dead</i> devotee — despite seeing Bruce Campbell make fun of some nerds a little while ago — so there was nothing sacred to them that this remake could sully. That said, I will mention stuff I think is better/worse between the originals and this

Jane Levy came to the cabin with friends and her brother to throw her stash down a well and get clean. This isn’t the first time she has tried to get clean, so they’re not going to let her leave, no matter what

As it goes in these cabins in the woods, they discover dozens of dead cats and a book wrapped in barbed wire. So, of course, they unwrap it. And with every warning in the book that says not to say what is in the book out loud, they ignore it and summon something

The thing summoned shows itself to Jane Levy, so you know, she’d like to leave… you see where this is going

The camera does the movement from the originals to convey the spirit moving through the woods, which is neat. In fact, a lot of cinematography nods to Sam Raimi

The pacing on this is better than the originals — or maybe it utilizes more contemporary tropes so it moves in a more familiar way

Despite the chaos of this, I never felt like the demon acted unpredictably. It was always some iteration of “something gory and a lot of screaming” or “No, it’s me, I’m back, help me!” Not inherently wrong, but not interesting on its own

Overall, pretty fun! Not the banger that <i>Don’t Breathe</i> was, but far from the worst thing I’ve seen. Definitely among the goriest, though!

#### Stray Thoughts

- Nice CG Jeep driving over a river
- “Grandpa” is a good dog name
- That meat is old! I get it, you wanted it to bleed for the transition, but it’s gray 🤮
- “dying wouldn’t be so bad right now… I just don’t want to become the devil’s bitch!”
