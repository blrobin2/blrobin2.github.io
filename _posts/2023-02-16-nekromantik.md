**Rating:** /5

If horror movies are to be believed, any light jostling will result in one or more eyeballs falling out of your face

I think there are a number of interpretations of this movie that I can get on board with, such as the fight against desensitization of violence by insisting on inglorious and grotesque violence instead of slasher-esque violence, or the challenge to conservative German obscenity laws by playing directly within the laws

Of course, as it happens, this film does contribute to desensitization of violence as edgelords come to it to challenge themselves and to overcome their nausea as a right of passage. Also, Germany didn’t give a shit about this movie when it came out, so the challenge it claimed to make fell on deaf ears (at least initially)

Watching it, it’s hard not to see comedic intentions — the threesome with the corpse, the romantic music, and the condom on the pipe… the “nailing” of Jesus to the cross… And the ending? C’mon

So I don’t know dude! I kind of like parts of it, but I hated the killing and skinning of the rabbit. Regardless, not gonna watch this one again
