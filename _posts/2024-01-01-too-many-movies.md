title: "My Year of Too Many Movies (And The Years That Led Up to It)"
excerpt: "Or how I learned to stop worrying and love the low brow"

In 2023, I challenged myself to watch as many movies as possible. There wasn't any specific end-goal beyond watching the films I've meant to see and whatever else came across my path. As a result, I ended 2023 watching [971 movies](https://letterboxd.com/blrobin2/year/2023/).

I sometimes wrote a one-to-two-page write-up. In others, I made a list of observations made while watching. For the MST3K episodes I watched, I wrote out my favorite jokes the characters said about the movies.

As the year progressed, I discovered Letterboxd had movie challenges or scavenger hunts. A user creates a list of rules, and I make my list of movies based on those rules. The two challenges I took part in were [Hooptober X](https://boxd.it/pmi12/detail) and [The Criterion Challenge 2023](https://boxd.it/pXW6q/detail). I also created retroactive lists for these challenges, but made it through [Hooptober 9.0](https://boxd.it/pOmcY/detail) before needing a break.

After finishing those challenges, my final self-imposed goal was to watch [all the Cold War era James Bond movies](https://boxd.it/r6gwI) and rank them.

## Early Movie Years

I grew up exposed to Hollywood movies, with the occasional American indie if a friend mentioned it or the cover looked promising at Blockbuster. It wasn't until college that I experienced movies like Lost in Translation or Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind — movies that made me realize I had seen little.

Throughout college, I worked at Papa John's. I bonded with a coworker over music, and he asked me about movies I hadn't heard of. All the films were older or foreign. With my lack of exposure, he granted me access to a private torrent site called Karagarga and gave me a list of movies to get started. I downloaded The Seventh Seal and Stalker, and my brain broke.

I actively took part in Karagarga over the years. I collected world cinema classics or featured movies that sounded interesting. Despite my scattered viewing, I still had hundreds of films to watch.

I was in several long-term relationships for the next decade of my life. I didn't feel like I could share these movies with my partners. Many of these movies languished on old hard drives. A few years ago, I set up a Plex server. The server made it easier to watch these movies.

I still, however, didn't watch many of the movies. In the meantime, I kept up with Oscar films or the occasional MST3K episode.

## Movie Podcasts

Around 2015, I started listening to bad movie podcasts — where they would watch a bad movie and then talk about it. My favorites were [The Flop House](https://www.flophousepodcast.com/) and [How Did This Get Made](https://www.earwolf.com/show/how-did-this-get-made/).

On one episode of The Flop House, they had Joe Bob Briggs on. I had never heard of him, but the podcast hosts revered his encyclopedic knowledge of exploitation and horror films. Joe Bob did a 24-hour marathon called [The Last Drive-In with Joe Bob Briggs](https://www.shudder.com/series/watch/the-last-drive-in-just-joe-bob/5d1deb764e879cfc?season=1). I got access to Shudder and watched those movies. I enjoyed them, but I had trouble dealing with the gross effects and the overt misogyny.

Around the same time, I'd heard an ad on The Flop House for another show on their network called [Switchblade Sisters](https://maximumfun.org/podcasts/switchblade-sisters/). The podcast focused on women in the movie industry talking about genre films they liked, which included some problematic films. The podcast clicked something in my brain that I still carry: you can love a movie and still acknowledge and critique its flaws.

I began digging into horror and exploitation films, remembering that they are flawed works made by humans.

## Letterboxd

In 2020, I started a [Letterboxd account](https://letterboxd.com/blrobin2). I can't remember who told me about it, but I began logging every movie I had seen. I would give it a star rating if I could remember what I felt. If not, I would flag it as watched.

I started rating movies how I used to score music: I would consume it in total and then assign it a star rating. Having these movies on record, I realized how quickly I forgot about them. On multiple occasions, I logged on to see if I had seen a movie, only to discover that I had not only seen it but also liked it.

Letterboxd has two types of power users. Some use the review section for quick jokes, others for detailed reviews. I tried the former approach, too scared to reveal how little I knew about movies.

Near the end of 2022, I was burning out on how I approached music. Despite spending hours listening, I only found a few albums I truly loved. It didn't feel worth the effort.

I pivoted to movies. I decided I would start writing reviews of each movie I watched. The goal was to document my likes and dislikes about a film. If I returned to it, I would have a justification for my positive or negative review.

## Three Lives

As I entered 2023, I had more time, so I started watching more movies. I noticed more about each movie I watched as I wrote my reviews. I felt my attention span increasing as I tried to evaluate what I saw. I kept expecting a similar experience with music where I would burn out.

Some days, I would watch five movies. Others, I might watch one. When I watched something daily, I felt my love and appreciation for the power of films grow.

As a result, I found the resolve to watch those foreign movies I had waited years to watch. I am so happy I have waited until now. I saw things with a fresh, interested perspective.

It was as if I was making up for lost time, discovering my love for movies. I felt like I was developing my identity and discovering what matters.

There's a scene from the movie [Yi Yi](https://letterboxd.com/film/yi-yi/)  that has stayed in my mind since I watched a couple of months ago:

> — Life is a mixture of sad and happy things. Movies are so lifelike, that’s why we love them.<br>
— Then who needs movies? Just stay home and live life!<br>
— My uncle says, “We live three times as long since man invented movies.”<br>
— How can that be?<br>
— It means movies give us twice what we get from daily life.

## 2024 Goals

I don't know what my movies goals will be in 2024. I have two lists to watch: [The Criterion Challenge 2024](https://boxd.it/qWjuA/detail) and [The Anti-Criterion Challenge 2024](https://boxd.it/qBmUY/detail). We'll see what life offers.
