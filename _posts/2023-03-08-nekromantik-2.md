Opens with a Ted Bundy quote about mastering death and life — the movie seems to be about Monika trying to move on from her necrophilia and be among the living

Being shot on higher quality film stock, the movie is more tolerable as the special effects look more fake (still gross)

Drinking a glass of milk while cleaning your corpse boyfriend may be the most nauseating thing onscreen

A funny juxtaposition between a statue of a girl and a monkey walking hand-in-hand, and Monika walking hand-in-hand with her new living boyfriend

Was not interested in watching real seals be chopped up so skipped that scene

I still don’t know how to rate these movies
