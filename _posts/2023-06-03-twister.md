**Rating:** 3/5

Watching this for a podcast

Storm chasers with trauma — Phillip Seymour Hoffman is a perfectly insufferable dude-bro, Cary Elwes is a slimy dick, Alan Ruck and Jeremy Davis are… there. This brand of 90s movie is comfort food to a bunch of folks, it’s incredibly easy to watch

I haven’t seen this since I was a kid and I remember these special effects feeling so real and scary. I’m sure I’ve drunkenly argued that they still look good, despite not seeing it in years. Egg on my face!

Bill Paxton makes no sense as the lead, and the lesson seems to have been learned because I can’t recall any other mainstream movies where he is. Keep him in the sci-fi/horror world where he can be a goddamn weirdo

One of the best dumb climaxes I can remember — tankers exploding, rivals driving directly into a tornado, and of course the belt and the iconic pipe scene

If I remember correctly, the screenshots of Dorothy collecting data were actually from the simulation software they used for the tornado effects

I’ll be honest, I was dreading this, but I had a good time, especially in the end when it went full gonzo — this is the sort of dumb fun that <i>Sharknado</i> wished it could replicate

<b>Five acts, five tornados, five times the fun! </b>I put that in just in case someone comes to me for a pull quote about the movie
