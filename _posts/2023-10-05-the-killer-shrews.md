**Rating:** 1.5/5

This movie is so goofy — the climax is them slowly moving under barrels while dogs in "shrew" masks crowd around them

* its a lotta quiet, too lotta quiet
* gotta plug the boat in for the night
* i don't know everything — i don't know how fish work
* honey i think we got puppets down here
* tonight, all dogs go to hell
