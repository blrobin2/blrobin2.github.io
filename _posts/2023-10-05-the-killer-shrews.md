This movie is so goofy — the climax is them slowly moving under barrels while dogs in "shrew" masks crowd around them

- its a lotta quiet, too lotta quiet
- gotta plug the boat in for the night
- i don't know everything — i don't know how fish work
- honey i think we got puppets down here
- tonight, all dogs go to hell
