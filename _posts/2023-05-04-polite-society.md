What The Hell? This movie rules!

Great pacing and editing, so many fun cuts and music queues, the fights are thematic and cool, hilarious, and the perfect ending!

It wears its influences on its sleeve — a little Guy Richie, a touch of <i>Oceans 11,</i> and some Tarantino-style soundtrack with a healthy dose of Bollywood-esque score, among others — but it all fits together nicely and doesn’t feel like pastiche

My only major complaint is some of the third-act pacing, but it's not egregious — it just has a lot of notes it has to come back around on

Well worth staying up past my bedtime for. See it in the theater before a Marvel takes it out!
