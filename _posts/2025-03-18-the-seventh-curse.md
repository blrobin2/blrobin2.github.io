The best Indiana Jones movie isn't an Indiana Jones movie. Goodbye, Dr. Jones. Hello, Dr. Yuen!

Ni Kuang, author of the Dr. Yuen and Wisely series, has his heroes at a party, where he regales a story about his heroes and a stubborn reporter for Western Daily, Tsui Hung. After Dr. Yuen stops a hostage situation (no thanks to Tsui), he fights a man named Black Dragon, who reminds him of a blood curse placed one year ago.

Dr. Yeun must travel to Northern Thailand to find a permanent cure for his curse and Bachu's, a woman he encountered there.

This movie moves a mile a minute! I initially wrote so much more for the summary, but I put my favorite bits in the spoilers section below. The film is so full of delightful surprises and fun! I had a massive grin on my face nearly the entire runtime.


<b>*** Stray Thoughts / Spoilers ***</b>
* Ni Kuang plays himself! I can tellâ€”he's such a smiley little nerd.
* Tsui wants an interview with Dr. Yuen and tasteful nudes of him.
* Wait, so a woman paid off Dr. Yuen's maid so that she could fuck him?
* Dr. Yuen goes to Thailand to find treatments for AIDs. Is the blood curse a metaphor for AIDs?
* Bachu is just bathing in a t-shirt for no reason.
* The Great Wizard's worm baby.
* Skeletons with glowing eyes are the 80's most significant contributions to cinema.
* Bachu is using boob magic to help Yuen.
* The bullet AND the arrow.
* Just churning up those kids!
* The Buddha statue fight scene is an all-timer!
* Oh, sweetie, the movie thinks it's progressive when its last message is, "Women's beauty comes from the heart."
