**Rating:** /5

Found a reference to this in VideoHound's Horror Show, and that it wasn't on Letterboxd/TMDB — thankfully, I was able to find info on the TV Guide website, a VHS box on eBay, and the documentary in full on YouTube

It's a weird doc — they interview spiritual healers alongside her family members. Otherwise, very 90s TV segment-core. I might have been more into it if I were an Anne Rice superfan
