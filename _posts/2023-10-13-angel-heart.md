<b>New York, 1955</b>

<blockquote><i>Johnny was as close to true evil as she ever wanted to come</i></blockquote>

Harry Angel (Mickey Rourke) is a private detective hired by Louis Cyphre (Robert De Niro) to track down Johnny Favorite. Favorite was a famous crooner before the war. He’s been giving Cyphre the runaround, so Cyphre wants to know if he’s still alive.

What starts as a simple missing persons case pulls Angel into the deep end, sending him to Louisiana, the heart of the blues and voodoo. Also, the people that Angel questions are winding up dead.

Who’s going to get to Angel first? The cops or Johnny?

I love a sweaty neo-noir with a detective who is his own worst enemy. Religion and Americana saturate Angels’ world, yet he remains on the outside.

Structurally, the film slags a bit when the leads run dry. But the film built a textured atmosphere, and I didn’t mind watching Mickey Rourke run around and get beat up.

This is one of those films with a twist that I don’t think hurts knowing ahead of time, but I won’t ruin anyone’s fun.

The film is a blast! Check it out.

#### SPOILER TALK

- It’s wild that this story is about someone who changed their face to hide from Satan. Didn’t Mickey Rourke do that?

- Christopher Nolan said that this and <i>The Wall</i> were substantial influences on <i>Memento</i>. I can’t speak for <i>The Wall</i>, but Guy Pierce wears a suit nearly identical to Mickey Rourke’s in this. Also, you know, dude with memory loss who doesn’t realize he’s the villain.

- I know why De Niro’s nails were long (he’s Lucifer, duh), but that doesn’t mean they didn’t make me uncomfortable.

- I wanted chickens to play into the ending somehow, but maybe it’s better than they don’t.

- Very <i>Oldboy</i>, making him have sex with his daughter.
