**Rating:** 4/5

I went in expecting a comedy and got something that, on paper, is a rom-com, but, in actuality, has a genuine emotional core and the specificities that make stories feel human.

Also, I got to see two of my movie crushes — Aubrey Plaza and Maria Dizzia — and cry a little, so I consider it a win.
