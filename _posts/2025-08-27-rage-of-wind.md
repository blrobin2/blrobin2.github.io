**Rating:** 2.5/5

I love the sound effects â€” punches sound like doors being snapped in half, and swords sound like lasers cutting metal.

This is one of the first movies I can remember watching where I hoped they used stock score because this movie is too cheap to warrant orchestration. And, no lie, this score has some bona fide bops.

Bill Corbett makes a joke where he pronounces "Lilo" of "Lilo and Stitch" as "Lie-low."

* If you're a fan of sudden close-ups of unknown characters, this movie's like Christmas morning.
* What? Who is this? It wouldn't be immediate commuppance for what we were just talking about, would it?
* Get this piece-of-shit immortal out of here!
* Where'd all that blood come from? And who's tapping the piano keys?
* Hope no one's playing the zoom-in drinking game.
