The male gaze is inverted, not (only) giving us the female gaze, but the experience of one who is within the gaze of several men

The camera blurs at the edges — Meg Ryan is on guard by default, and the world is only let in through narrow apertures — frenetic and dodgy, yet still managing to see

After the murder of Angela Sands, we see the consequence of being observed — the beauty and sex are severed from the human to whom it belongs — the head severed from the body and left behind

Yet, in this world of blood and violence, the desire for love — the desire to not just be seen but understood — remains. And so, despite that instinct that says to run, Ryan opens up a little and experiences something with Mark Ruffalo, who believes he knows exactly what women want — and sometimes he might, but good head is not the (only) key to love

And we also get to see Mark Ruffalo’s penis, so that’s pretty neat
