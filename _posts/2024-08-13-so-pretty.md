">Anti-Criterion Challenge 2024 | 32/52 | Directed by a trans or nonbinary director whose work you haven’t seen before</a></b>

<blockquote><i>This film tells of four young people attempting to organize their lives. Their problem is that their love is already organized. Their love is organized in exclusivity, self-defense, and coupledom.</i></b></blockquote>

Franz picks up Tonia from the airport. They lay in bed reading <i>So Schön</i> together.

Paul makes coffee in a French press. He and Erika sit together and talk with Paul’s mother, Gera.

The movie follows this slice-of-life depiction of these characters and their lives. We don’t get to know much about them beyond the occasional readings the characters perform about the film itself.

I don’t know how to rate this — it feels less like a film and more like an art piece. As a short, this could be pretty brilliant. As a full-length, it feels like it has a hard time figuring out what to do with the runtime.

That said, it feels like an essential document of life that we don’t get enough of, so I’m glad it exists.
