**Rating:** 3.5/5

<b>Stray Thoughts/Spoilers</b>
* Her friend Marissa getting fucked by Khalid — perfect use of the slow zoom
* Dre’s striptease is inspired — Dominique Fishback is crushing it
* “Did you just bite Ni’Jah?”
* I thought this would be like <i>Der Fan</i>, but it has a unique take on fandom and obsession.
* Billie Eilish knows how to use her eyes
* Miss Kirby made me tear up
* Best possible ending
