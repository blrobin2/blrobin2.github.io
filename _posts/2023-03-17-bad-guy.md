A deeply twisted attempt to invert the trope of ‚Äúturn a prostitute into a proper woman‚Äù

Though this is definitely the story of one man systematically ruining a woman‚Äôs life in order to get her to fall for him, and not one ‚Äúno‚Äù by her is ever heeded, I think the director wants to evaluate morality on a more nuanced scale. Or he just wants to manipulate you into cheering for horrible people. How successful it is, I‚Äôm not really sure

It‚Äôs hard to forget the opening scene where he forces himself on her and kisses her right in front of her boyfriend. And he tricks her into prostitution. So like‚Ä¶ why am I supposed to like this guy by the end? Because he doesn‚Äôt let johns beat her up too badly?

About halfway through, she encounters a doppelg√§nger who tears up a photo and drowns herself in the ocean. She picks up the pieces and finds all but the faces: the doppelg√§nger and a boyfriend ‚Äî her unfulfilled/stolen desire

I don‚Äôt recommend this. It is a well-crafted film from a technical standpoint, but I feel like I am missing cultural or metatextual context that might help me like this more (or hate it more?)

<b>Stray thoughts</b>
* Why the hell was that guy carrying around $10,000 in his wallet??
* Why the hell did she take the wallet??
* ‚ÄúI feel responsible for making you like this‚Ä¶‚Äù huh, you think? ü§î
