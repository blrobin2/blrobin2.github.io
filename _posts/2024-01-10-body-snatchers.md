Marti's family is moving to a military base — her father, Steve, her step-mom Carol, and Carol's six-year-old son, Andy. Steve works for the EPA, and they have asked him to test the water and surrounding area for effects from the toxic chemicals tested at the base.

At a gas station, a man pins Marti against the wall and warns her of something that "gets you when you sleep."

While testing, a man approaches Steve, telling him about people with odd psychological behavior — paranoia, insomnia. Steve reassures him that the chemicals at the base wouldn't have those effects.

This film is yet another adaptation of Invasion of the Body Snatchers. But the special effects and creepy vibes help this one stand out.

I don't care about the metaphor. It could be conformity or the American nuclear family or whatever.

The best part about this movie is that it's less than 90 minutes, so it doesn't overstay its welcome.

<b>Thoughts / Spoilers

- Andy's painting is legitimately fantastic.
- Tim's got the deadest eyes.
- Meg Tilly rules
- It was shocking to see the mom's head cave in.
- Oh hey, they do the finger-point-and-yell
- The special effects are so goopy. Larry Cohen likes melty people.
- "I fucked your girlfriend." Like, no, you didn't? Why would the real Tim panic about that?
- Boy butts
- Oops, all out of budget. That's a weird helicopter shot.
- Oh, because they had a fuck ton of explosions to do.
