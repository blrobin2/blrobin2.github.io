I've been revisiting the past decade in music, trying to catch all the music I didn't the first time around, as well as revisit some old favorites. When I finish with each year, I'll post a list of my personal favorite 10 from that year. I encourage you to listen to any you haven't, as well as tell me what you think, what should be on here that isn't, what is on here that shouldn't be, etc.

- 10: Red House Painters - Old Ramon
- 9: The Avalanches - Since I Left You
- 8: Spoon - Girls Can Tell
- 7: The Strokes - Is This It
- 6: Low - Things We Lost in the Fire
- 5: The Microphones - The Glow, Pt. 2
- 4: Unwound - Leaves Turn Inside You
- 3: Bjork - Vespertine
- 2: Radiohead - Amnesiac
- 1: Daft Punk - Discovery
