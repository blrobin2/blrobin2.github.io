**Rating:** 3/5

This must be what straight people think drag is. The costumes were delightful, but the actors lacked choreography, dance, or lip-syncing skills (Hugo Weaving came closest). Tim Chappel, the costume designer, performs "Save the Best for Last" by Vanessa Williams in drag over the credits, and it's stunning by comparison.

Also, I'm pretty over queer movies requiring horrifying moments where they may be raped or killed, especially in an otherwise lighthearted road movie.

I enjoyed aspects of this movie (see Guy Pierce shirtless for most of the runtime), but time hasn't done this any favors.
