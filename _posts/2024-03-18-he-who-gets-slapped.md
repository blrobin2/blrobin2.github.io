<blockquote><i>In the grim comedy of life, it has been wisely said that the last laugh is the best</i></blockquote>Paul Beaumont is a scientist working on a new theory on the origin of humanity. Paul and his wife, Marie, spent years struggling. Baron Regnard took interest in his work and invited Paul and Marie into his home.

One day, Paul completes the proof he needs to take his theory before the Academy. When Paul goes to sleep, his wife helps the Baron steal Paul's papers so that the Baron can present the ideas as his own.

When Paul and the Baron appear before the Academy, Paul tries to speak up for himself, but the Baron slaps Paul and calls him a mere assistant, which causes the Academy to laugh at Paul. Paul goes to Marie for consolation, but she reveals her affair with the Baron and calls Paul a clown.

Five years later, we see Paul has become a circus clown, going by "HE, who gets slapped." Though he performs a humiliating role, he believes he is moving on. That is until the Baron returns to his life.

The film captures the essence of comedy â€” that time can turn life's tragedies into something we can laugh at. But time can also make us its fool if we cannot escape its shadow.

Lon Chaney is heartbreaking. For the period, he gives a natural performance.

The film uses a clown spinning a globe as a transitional piece. The clown is horrifying. It's impossible to see any of the clowns in this movie as anything other than nightmares.

The neon sign of the slapped clown is pretty funny

The movie has a cute horse who gives a humanizing performance

This is the first movie to feature MGM's lion mascot!

I'm unsure why this gets put in the thriller/horror bucket, but it's a well-made tragedy.
