With Andrea Martin, Michelle Trachtenberg, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, and Lacey Chabert in the cast, how could this be bad?

#### Stray Observations/Spoilers

- Clark sanitarium
- "I'm your family now," says your college boyfriend. Not a red flag at all!
- Michelle Trachtenberg is very <i>Gossip Girl</i>-coded
- I love curling up with a blanket and watching a sex tape I made with my sorority sister's boyfriend
- The camera is allergic to any angle that isn't Dutch
- The eyeball rip-out (EDIT: plural rip-outs, good lord) is a lot
- 1970s flashback â€” cue the bisexual lighting
- Yellow-skinned Billy
- "I was in Vietnam! You think I'm afraid of a guy with a hammer?"
- Mary Elizabeth Winstead has a Southern accent
- Everyone is so mean ðŸ˜ª
- They can't decide if Billy's backstory channels Tim Burton or Rob Zombie
- Okay, they decided â€” it's Rob Zombie
- I've heard of Girl Scout cookies, but girl SKIN cookies?!
- Eyeball screensaver
- "Dick Cheney's a better sister to you than your own sister."
