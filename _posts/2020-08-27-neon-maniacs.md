Basically Stranger Things, but the kids are horror fans and the monsters are... well, we never find out. The movie is functionally incomplete, brought to a halt by budget concerns, so the movie does not have a satisfying ending, and leaves some questions unanswered. Despite this, it has its charms. Enjoy the weird blend of 80s zombie gore and teen movie tropes
