**Rating:** 2.5/5

An acting troupe rows out to a remote island and performs a resurrection spell. They dig up a body, name him Orville, and take him with them

The script is solid, and the performances have that “we’re a theater troupe who takes ourselves too seriously” vibe, especially Alan. Val has the best lines, she regularly makes Alan look like a fool

Anya is a total weirdo who you know is going to have a great time while everyone else is running scared — she gives me Drusilla vibes

My favorite parts are the quips from the gay actors who pretend to be zombies, they remind me of a John Waters movie

The last 15 minutes, like so many horror movies, is when the action begins and the soundtrack comes into play. If only the journey there was compelling

If you like dumb campy low-budget horror comedies, give it a whirl. It seems fun for the right audience, I just don’t think that’s me
