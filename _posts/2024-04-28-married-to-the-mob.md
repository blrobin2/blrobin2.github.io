<b>Another Jonathan Demme movie where he uses Goodbye Horses</b>

Angela (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Frank (Alec Baldwin) are on the rocks. Frank is moving up in the mob family, and Angela is sick of the mob, the wives, and the whole life. When their son finds Frank's gun, Angela asks for a divorce. Frank laughs and tells her to take a valium.

Tony (Dean Stockwell) has a girl, Karen. Frank and her are secretly seeing each other. But when Frank gets to the hotel to meet her, Karen has a bullet in her head, and Tony is waiting. Tony shoots Frank.

On suspicion of Tony killing Karen and Frank, FBI Agent Mike (Matthew Modine) gets a 24-hour detail on Tony so he can finally take the family out.

Meanwhile, Tony chases Angela while Angela is on her way out. But when Tony makes a move, the mob wives and the FBI catch it, thinking she's having an affair with Tony. The FBI tails Angela, thinking she'll lead them to Tony.

But Angela and Mike meet cute, and Mike lies about living in the building. With all these plates spinning, what's going to drop first?

I had a hard time getting into the movie at first. I'm so over mob shit, and the first act wasn't doing much for me. When it gets soft and cute, though, I'm having a tremendous time.  

The movie shows the most personality when a character's internal thought process leaks into reality — when dream logic and irrational fear overtake the movie. The hit at the restaurant has a weird dreaminess — a slo-mo clown with a gun in each hand.

Michelle Pfeiffer is outstanding — this was her breakthrough role, and it makes sense. 

I initially hated Matthew Modine — but as it got more into the romcom parts, I understood his choices. His room, having a Buster Keaton/Rube Goldberg method of getting dressed, is a bold choice, but it sets in our head that we're supposed to see him as a Harold Lloyd type — a sincere doof who falls in love and trouble with equal ease.

Connie breaks my heart — Mercedes Ruehl is perfect.

Dean Stockwell shouldn't work in this role, but he does?? Maybe I'm underselling him. He wasn't good in <i>Battlestar Galactica</i> or <i>The Wicker Man</i>, and I haven't seen <i>Quantum Leap</i>, so I assumed he wasn't that good of an actor.

The credit sequence is so weird! It continues the story, I think?? It even has a post-credit sequence.

This movie came together eloquently! It goes through many familiar troupes and puts a personal spin on each one. This movie is the first time I've felt like Jonathan Demme as auteur has made sense to me.
