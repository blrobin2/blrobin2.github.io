<i>Romania, 1987</i>

Găbița is pregnant. Her roommate, Otilia, has been helping her put together money and resources for Găbița to have an abortion.

Abortions are illegal in Romania, so they've found someone who will help them.

The problem is that Găbița got several of the details wrong. For one, she told the doctor she was three months along when it's closer to five. They prosecute an abortion at or after five months as murder.

The doctor will help, but the cost differs from what they expected.

Meanwhile, Otilia must handle her prying boyfriend Adi, who is making her come to his mother's birthday party that night. They argue over what would happen if she got pregnant. He either denies the possibility or says he would marry her. She doesn't want to raise his kids.

The film has several long takes, letting conversations unfold naturally.

Anamaria Marinca, who plays Otilia, is brilliant here. Throughout the movie, she carries a heavy emotional burden while managing the details.

Although the film lacks explicit political discourse, we observe bureaucracy through background elements of the story, such as checking passes, IDs, and tickets. No moment feels private.

The character of Găbița is so frustrating — a good portion of the film's tension comes from her ignoring instructions or forgetting. But it's important to note that her pregnancy is never the issue. It's how she deals with the details and how it affects Otilia.

This film is concise and focused, centering the characters for the few hours we spend with them.
