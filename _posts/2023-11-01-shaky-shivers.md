Lucy (Brooke Markham) and Karen (VyVy Nguyen) go to an abandoned camp to wait for the full moon. Lucy has a wound on their forearm. While waiting, they dig through crap in Karen’s car, such as a trapper keeper full of spells and a gun. You know, for when Lucy turns into a werewolf.

A guy in a werewolf rubber mask jumps up to their car window, spooking Karen. She shoots them by accident with the gun.

We cut to one day earlier. The two friends work in an unpopular ice cream store with annoying coworker Eric. As night falls and closing time approaches, a woman enters, covered in foliage and wearing a hand puppet whose mouth is full of teeth. The woman tries to buy ice cream with a pinecone. When denied, the woman bites Lucy with the puppet.

In the present, Lucy wakes up alone and naked in the wilderness. Where is Karen? Who did they shoot last night? And what’s that haunting howling she hears in the distance?

Sung Kang, known for his role as Han in the Fast & Furious movies, directed the movie. It is lighthearted, with dark humor and gross-out moments peppered throughout. The horror elements drive the story, but the movie isn't scary.

Brooke Markham and VyVy Nguyen have good friendship chemistry. The characters’s shared history allows them to draw on that past to move the plot forward and keep it (somewhat) believable.

This isn't a great movie, but it's watchable.
