Leslie struggles to carry the groceries, handle the dog, Marbo, and open the front door. She calls her daughter, Jennifer, to help, to no avail. She struggles to the back door, seeing Jennifer on the phone with her father and Leslie's husband, Howard. Jennifer puts Howard on speakerphone and lets Leslie in, who gives Howard a rundown of the night's vegetarian (again) dinner. Howard hears "seaweed quiche" and says he can't make dinner. He hangs up before Leslie can argue. Jennifer runs off, too, meeting Stacey at the horror and science fiction convention.

Another night alone with Marbo, Leslie plops on the couch to find something to watch. Leslie sees a news report about a dog attack, but the dog in the report looks like the mayor. The woman claims the mayor is a werewolf. Howard returns home, hiding a bag of food, and falls asleep on the couch to Leslie's plea for more excitement in their life.

The next day, Howard has the boys over to watch a ball game on TV, relegating Leslie to being a housemaid and beer fetcher. Frustrated, Leslie leaves to grab a flea collar at the pet store. The mysterious owner, Harry Thropen, gives her a handful of flea collars on the house. When she steps outside, a thief snatches her purse. Harry sees it happen, corners the thief, and returns Leslie's purse to her. As thanks, she buys him lunch. She finds herself drawn to him and his unusual eyes. Harry licks and kisses her, bringing her back to the pet store to have sex. He sucks on her toe, biting it and drawing blood. That breaks the spell, and Leslie storms out.

The family notices slight changes in Leslie. For one, she cooks steaks for dinner. She's also more voracious in the bedroom. And it looks like she may be sprouting fangs. I hate to say it, but it looks like Jennifer's mom is becoming a werewolf!

The movie operates in an unusual space. It is not innocent enough for a family movie—the phrase "toe job" comes up, among other sexual innuendos—but it is not violent or scary enough for most horror fans. That said, it's pretty silly, even funny at times. The movie has a scene similar to <i>The Santa Clause</i>'s beard-shaving scene but with leg hair.

Of course, my favorite character is Stacey, a kindred horror fanatic. I, too, feel like I have to drag folks to my horror events and movies. Susan Blakely is quite entertaining as Leslie. She has solid comedic timing and delivers some groan-worthy lines with enough pizzazz to make them work.

Folks will compare this movie to Michael Fischa's more successful and ridiculous horror movie, <i>Death Spa</i>. I appreciate that Fischa tried to diversify his directorial efforts. And I kind of like this movie! It doesn't do anything groundbreaking, but I had a fun time! Throw a Halloween party into your film, and I will have a hard time hating it.
