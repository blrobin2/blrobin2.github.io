In classic Giallo fashion, a horse-drawn carriage ambles through Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, USA. It crosses over a roadway where cars wait to cross. In one car is Bob Crane, a forest ranger. He arrives at Hamilton's Store, a kitschy souvenir shop, where Mrs. Gordon brings him a long-awaited package. Inside is Moda Italia, a fashion magazine. On the cover is Bob's twin sister, Jessica — her first cover. It also has a handwritten note from Jessica giving her new address and phone number in Milan, Italy.

Throughout all this, we get glimpses of Jessica's life in Milan — a lingerie photoshoot followed by a night at the discotheque. Some man follows her into the bathroom. He pours some coke onto the side of his hand and forces it into her face. When she resists, he pins her against the wall and pulls down her dress to bite her nipples. She scratches the man's neck.

While this happens, Bob receives a call over the radio atop a lookout tower. Warren wants him to check on some campers on his way home. Bob is descending the lookout tower steps. As the man in Milan pins Jessica's hand behind her, Bob feels his hand pulled behind his back. He struggles not to fall over the railing. Jessica writhes loose of the man's grip and Bob regains composure.

Jessica returns to her hotel to take a shower. She takes a pill. Bob checks on the campers. He crosses a bridge and begins feeling woozy. He falls into a trance as he looks over the bridge. He sees the hotel where Jessica is staying. Though he attempts to carry on, his vision shifts between where he is and the eyes of a stranger. The eyes walk down the hotel hall, black-gloved and holding a pair of scissors. They stand in front of Jessica's door.

Bob runs to his truck and calls Warren on the radio. He gives Warren Jessica's number, telling him to call her and to tell her not to open the door. They get through to the hotel front desk, asking him to check on Jessica. The clerk checks the room, but it looks unoccupied.

So, Bob travels to Milan to find her. He goes through the hotel. The scene mirrors his vision but at a different time of day. She still isn't there. So, Bob goes to the local police inspector Danesi to ask for his help in tracking Jessica down. Though Danesi doubts Bob's supposed psychic connection to Jessica, he agrees to help.

The influences may be obvious — <i>Blow-Up</i>'s fashion photography and murders, <i>Sister</i>'s twin telepathy, and <i>Body Double</i>'s POV kills and big drill.

Donald Pleasance plays Inspector Danesi, complete with a mustache and a terrible Italian accent.

FireWatch fans will get a powerful sense of déjà vu watching the Yellowstone portion.

The movie will come to a halt — sometimes mid-sentence — so someone can spot a nude or semi-nude model wandering about. It's so funny.

They play "One Night in Bangkok," from the musical <i>Chess</i>, during a fashion show. The subtitles provide the lyrics and they're so disorienting. 

The film gets a little gay but in a problematic way. I'll leave it there and avoid spoilers.

The film is pretty good. The ending is the best part; it feels like it takes so long to get there. If you need gratuitous nudity or De Palma references, here you go.
