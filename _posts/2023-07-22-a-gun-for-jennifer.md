**Rating:** 4/5

Allison (Deborah Twiss) has just arrived in New York City when two men attack her. But before they can go too far, a woman vigilante gang shows up, castrating and killing them

The gang pulls Allison into their circle. Allison tells them her name is Jennifer, and she isn’t allowed to leave because she knows too much

Unlike most rape revenge movies, this one starts well after the revenge has started and escalated to a project that has taken over these women’s lives, and how despite their best intentions, innocent people end up hurt or killed

The aesthetic has a grindcore, low-budget feel, making all the bloody violence more visceral. Also, the soundtrack fucking rules

Deborah Twiss — who also co-wrote the script — is great in this. No one is going for realism in the acting, but she has a complicated role to play in the story, and she makes it work

I had a blast with this one! It’s been in distribution hell since it came out in 97 — primarily due to licensing rights on the soundtrack — only getting a physical release in Europe, so you gotta Tubi it, but it’s worth the commercial breaks
