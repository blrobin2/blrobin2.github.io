Melvin Ferd is a shitty janitor at the Tromaville Health Club. When a toxic waste disposal truck parks outside the club to do drugs, Melvin falls into a vat of toxic waste and becomes Toxie.

This movie propelled Troma into the cultural consciousness, establishing their credo — gross, horny, and stupid by design. Up to this point, they made cheap softcore, but when someone told them horror movies were dead, they had to make their spin on it.

The movie is cheap, but they killed it with the stunts and the set pieces. The gore grossed me out on more than one occasion.

How did this piece of shit win me over?


<b>*** Thoughts/Spoilers***</b>
* I remember seeing trailers for this on late-night television.
* The scene where they run over the kid's head is a grapefruit filled with fake blood.
* Lots of eyes being gouged out
* The guy who gets his arm ripped off was a tax agent who lost an arm in Vietnam.
* Dead dog surrounded by guts — that scene caused a mass walkout.
* All the cops eating tacos while investigating the murders.
* Sarah, the blind girlfriend, has Groucho Marx-level eye control.
* They put the spinning newspapers on a spinning cheese plate to film.
* The weight machine partial decapitation
* Chief Himmel
* The Body Talk song in the credits is too catchy
