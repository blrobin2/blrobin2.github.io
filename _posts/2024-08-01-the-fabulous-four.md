Look, this movie sucks. It is quite cringey and no one has a character. But I snuck in some box wine, and girl, I was gagged.

I love Megan Mullally, she is so hot in this as Diet De Sade. I love Susan Sarandon, she is so hot as a cat-obsessed genius. I love Bette Midler, but scared of being alone TikToker is WOOF. I love Sheryl Lee Ralph as potanist ally, but she is defined more by her relationships than herself.

The boys were so handsome and adorable, especially Ernest Hemingway reincarnated in Timothy V. Murphy.

I got some good giggles out with all the moms in the audience!
