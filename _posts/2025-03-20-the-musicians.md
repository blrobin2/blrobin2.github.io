**Rating:** /5

<blockquote>Kazimierz Karabasz was one of the great Polish documentary filmmakers of the late 1950s. He was also Krzysztof Kieślowski's teacher at the Łódź Film School in the 1960s. <i>The Musicians</i> (<i>Muzykanci</i>) won the Great Prize at the International Film Festival in Oberhausen in 1958. Keiślowski rated the film, by which he was greatly influenced, as one of his top ten favorites of all time. In an article appearing in issue number 400 of the film journal <i>Positif</i>, Kieślowski paid homage to Karabasz saying: "It is rare for a short film to express so many things, in such a simple and beautiful way, with regards to the human need to create."</blockquote>

<blockquote><i>This is a film about people who repeatedly give of their free time. "Dęciaki" — once a veritable army of amateur musicians that now numbers only a few.</i></blockquote>
