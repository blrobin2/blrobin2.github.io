While all the meta elements and the pleading from the narrator donâ€™t stop this from being another Agatha Christie-esque mystery, the performances make for a delightful little movie

Coming out so close to <i>Glass Onion</i>, the movie will beg comparisons, but they both have different goals. In the end, this is the one that hits closer to my comfort zone, so I just happened to like it a bit more
