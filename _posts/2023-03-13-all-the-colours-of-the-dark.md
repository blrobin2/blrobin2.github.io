Hallucinatory, violent images pursue a woman, and everyone has an opinion on what she needs

The movie is pretty wild from the get-go, opening with a dream sequence containing images that will recur throughout

It isn’t until 30 minutes in, however, that the movie really starts to pop off. A friend advises her to visit some people for help with her mental issues, and those people are a Satanic cult

From there the movie sort of abandons a coherent plot for its psychedelic show, but it’s still entertaining throughout
