A high school field trip to Serbia goes off the rails... literally

Great selection of Eastern European extras — they perfectly convey the requisite "you don't belong here" energy

This flick has a lot of creative kills and special effects, especially on the train. I haven't seen several of these anywhere else. And almost all the stunts are done by the actors themselves — jumping off trains and all that

Surprisingly good cinematography — it elevates the material in small but effective ways — even during the slow parts, it keeps the energy flowing — a real pro can make the cheap stuff look

Mary Kohnert has such a haunted energy to her — I need to rewatch her Star Trek episodes — I don't remember her

This movie is pretty good! I'd recommend it to horror fans who don't mind budget absurdity

#### Stray Thoughts

- I love how much reverb the pan flutist gets from playing on a train
- It turns out I've seen <i>BTD 2</i> — it's Mario Bava's <i>Shock</i> — none of these movies have anything to do with each other
- It's such a shame they threw this movie into the <i>Beyond the Door</i> "series" to appeal to international markets (although its original title <i>Amok Train</i> isn't that much better)
- So many scenes with Serbian dialogue that receives no translation
