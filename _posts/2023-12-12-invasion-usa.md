**Rating:** 1/5

* [neuclear blast] that's what happens when you overcook a brat in the microwave 
* — oh shoot, this is Canada — bomb em anyway 
* you can carpet bomb it the afternoon and entertain guests at night
* Big Brother is kind of shy
* — anyone got a light? — i think one's coming now
* Um, excuse me, are you the enemy's homeland?
* Ah the sandy beaches of Dupont Circle
* I'm your personal Stalin representative, step aside
* This is very Jacob's Ladder-esque
