The movie has such a sweeping, dramatic score. The entire film has the defuse gauze over it. It’s so beautifully shot; I don’t care how meandering the plot is

It isn’t an early de Palma if a woman isn’t in the shower. When you look up “the male gaze,” it’s a picture of Angie Dickinson fingering herself in the shower

Peter’s homemade computer is fantastic, “it can hold up to a 20-digit figure”. It’s weird seeing young Arnie from Christine. I would watch a movie just about his spy gizmos

The painting of the gorilla in the seductive pose is so wild. But that art gallery scene altogether is top-tier visual storytelling. Everyone is flirting, and touching butts. She writes “nuts” on her grocery list; I laughed

Suddenly Tinto Brass makes a lot of sense visually. As De Palma is Hitchcock amped up to 11, Brass is De Palma amped up to 11, but Brass’s story is always “and then they fucked”

The scene where two scenes are shown side-by-side has big TikTok aesthetic

It sucks how many great movies have fucked up portrayals of trans people. I want to say we’ve come a long way, but… At the very (very, very) least, there’s the talk-show scene interviewing the trans woman
