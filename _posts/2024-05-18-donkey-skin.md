The king lives a perfect life. He has a "beautiful and virtuous" wife and a daughter of "grace and charm." They also have a donkey that shits jewels â€” the source of the kingdom's wealth.

One day, the queen becomes ill, and no one can heal her. On her deathbed, she has one request: that the king remarry someone more beautiful than her. The king receives several offers, but the only princess who meets the requirements is his daughter.

The film is a visual treat, filled with odd designs and rich colors. For example, the queen's coffin is a giant tree ornament. Horses are painting the colors of their respective houses (blue, red, orange, and whatnot).

The songs aren't memorable, but they're perfectly delightful.

I had a blast! I recommend pairing it with a psychedelic.
