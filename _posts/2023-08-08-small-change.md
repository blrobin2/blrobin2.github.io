**Rating:** 4.5/5

A blend of stories about young children in the summer of 1976 — some funny, some cute, some tragic

This movie is one of those "how do you even film this?" movies — so many children giving pretty authentic performances. But this is Truffaut, who did the same in The 400 Blows

The movie feels surreal at times — a toddler falls from a tall building, lands on his butt, and is fine. "The resilience of kids," they say

It's all about Mr. Richet's speech near the end — I don't know if I've ever seen a movie articulate what I felt as a child so fully and why I don't look back with nostalgic eyes
