**Rating:** 3/5

This is the earliest Miyazaki film I’ve seen, and while it doesn’t feel as mature, it still has some cool ideas, very Mœbius-inspired

So bored with wars! I don’t care about airship battles

I don’t know what to say, I just didn’t have a good time watching this. I appreciate the world building and craft of it, but I never latched onto the story or the characters. I recognize it’s a good movie, it just isn’t for me

Maybe I need to take a break from Miyazaki
