**Rating:** 3/5

As per usual, Verhoven’s reach far exceeds his grasp. It needed to be either more nunsploitation or more “portrait of a lady on fire”, but this middle place leaves you with a satisfying ending to a different movie than the one where Jesus regularly appears in visions chopping up snakes and bandits.
