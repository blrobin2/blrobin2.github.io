**Rating:** 2/5

* When are you guys gonna realize that when you kill each other, you're only hurting yourself?
* Shouldn't they have their headlights on?
* Most people are morally ambiguous, which explains our randoms deaths
* Back then, money was a lot of money
* It's gonna be a bad day, working with no DP
* This movie is just sitting on my head and crushing it
