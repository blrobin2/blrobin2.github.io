- You lost the last of the wild horses, you dink!
- Way to go Ted, now we have to talk to him again
- Foot Fetishists of the Old West!
- I’m so sick of gingham I could scream!
- Hello, I’m Susan, I’ll be our daughter today
- Wow this place is crawling with Holly Hobbies
- Psst, wanna get sequestered later?
- It’s a plot device! It’s very flimsy so be careful
- Just don’t tickle me — I’m thin and it wouldn’t be fairly

<b>From the actual movie</b>

<blockquote><i>Resist arrest? That’s just an excuse to legalize murder! The person didn’t even have a gun on him when he ‘resisted’…</i></blockquote>we’ve been having this conversation for so long (:
