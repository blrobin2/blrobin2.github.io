Three castaways huddle together on a small boat in the middle of the ocean.

Their clothes are ragged, their bodies hunched over in sunstroke and dehydration — together in an interminable prison sentence.

With no time constraints, the three recount their stories.

Inspired by a photo in a French magazine by André Kertész, the film creates a loose narrative structure to showcase visual moods and tones.

The soundtrack is perfect — emotional and evocative, but never overbearing the images.

The image compositions are elegant. The water sparkling in the sunlight has such an impressionist quality.

Though unintentional, the state of disrepair of the film adds a layer of beauty.

Specific close-ups evoke the silent era of Dreyer, emphasizing emotions displayed on the face.

The efforts to restore this lost film are heartwarming. This film is one of the most distinct silent-era pieces.
