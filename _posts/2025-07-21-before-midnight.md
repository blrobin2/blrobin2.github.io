**Rating:** 3.5/5

When Adam and I watched this, our question at the end was, "Are they still in love with each other?" My answer is yes. This film (in its deeply flawed, male-writer-centered way) shows how different love looks when you're this far in AND unafraid to speak your mind.

My fear of saying the wrong thing has prevented some minor relationship arguments in the past. It has also contributed to irreparable rifts where I didn't feel I could confide in them. If we argued like this, would we have stayed together? Maybe. Would we be happy? Who knows!

For some people, a relationship only works if they bail when it gets too difficult. I don't blame them, because this is what the other side can look like. I'm not saying I want it, or that it's always this way, or even should be this way â€” just that, for these two, this is what their love looks like.
