<b>**_ Stray Thoughts / Spoilers _**</b>

- Immediately love the aesthetic!
- Is this what <i>The Devil Wears Prada </i>is based on?
- blood and brains and bozazz
- Pink!!
- You could convince me that this came out in the 80s â€” the 80s makeup is so late 50s-60s
- "Look at her, she's reading."
- Fred Astaire is just pushing Audrey Hepburn around like she's nobody. He underreacts to everything!
- "Do you know what empathy is?"
- They fucking assault her. It's impossible to be on their side!
- "Bring her back here, girls! Alive!"
- Gershwin was not cooking with this one.
- Oh, but the dancing...
- I love a surprise choir of boys
- Its deeply fucked that they went to Paris and Astaire bought Napa Valley wine.
- An iconic dance by Hepburn in the beat poet den.
- This movie crushes the live sets that feel like stage sets.
- "I thought you'd be old!" She has such a daddy thing
- I don't like the Voodoo song sung by two white people
- Ultimately, it's a movie where Audrey Hepburn gets to wear many pretty dresses.
- What happened to the pink theme? I wanted all these dresses to be pink!
- "I love every broken bone in your body" sounds like a Sufjan Stevens lyric.
- "S'Wonderful" is from this?
- Oh, there's a 1927 <i>Funny Face</i> musical that only four songs from it made it to this movie.
