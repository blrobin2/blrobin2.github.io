**Rating:** 5/5

THE defining Jidaigeki ghost film. It has many imitators, also great, but this one set the blueprint

Such beautiful lighting and cinematography — the boat in the fog sets down such a sense of unease; the vision of his wife receiving the kimono he worked so hard to buy for her; the slipping further into idyllic, surreal images; the moment when his wife is sewing just before dawn — every scene has something special

Killer soundtrack, too. Really uncomfortable stuff

Hard to overhype this one. It’s pretty special
