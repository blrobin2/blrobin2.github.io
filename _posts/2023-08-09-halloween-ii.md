<blockquote><i>I'm not me</i></blockquote>Haunted by the lingering effects of her experience, Laurie dreams through her brother's eyes, only learning through Loomis's book that she is Michael Myer's sister

This movie gets so insane so quickly, just piles of gore and absurdities, the nightmare overtaking reality, the boogeyman revived

I get why this is so divisive — from a purely aesthetic viewpoint, this is as exploitative as it gets in the mainstream. And being in that position isn't what Rob Zombie wants — it's only because of his music career that his movies have
received so much attention (and this is another remake of a horror classic). But for those who would be here regardless, they are getting what they want — high-budget surrealist shlock

<b>Stray Thoughts</b>
* White horse in the spotlight, I get the Twin Peaks comparisons now
* "Nights in White Satin." I get it
* Jack Nance would've been a great Uncle Meat
* Half a star for the Weird Al cameo
* "Are you a giant? Can we be friends?!"
* That Halloween party seems insufferable
