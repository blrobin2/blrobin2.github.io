The final Coleman Francis film of the show. Thank god.

- Get off my land, you credits
- Noted scientist and airplane
- It is more suspenseful when you don't know what's going on
- Secret data. Pictures of the moon. Nude
- Coleman Francis: the cinematic poet of parking
- Desert patrolman, lover of fine wines
- In all my years on the force, I've never seen a flat tire like this
- Touch a button, things happen sometimes
- It's Nickelodeon's Waiting for Godot
- Man's inhumanity to man, or beast's inbeastity to beast
