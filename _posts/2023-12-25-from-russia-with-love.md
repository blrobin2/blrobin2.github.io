<b><a href="https://boxd.it/r6gwI">Bond, Ranked Bond: The Cold War’s Horniest Spy</a></b>

<b>Stray Thoughts / Spoilers</b>
* Straight away, too much makeup was on Connery’s face.
* Oh, never mind, it’s supposed to be a mask.
* 00 of 007 over tinsel-bedecked boobs. Nice.
* The chess game on the board is legit! Why did black throw the game, though?
* ?’s white kitty is perfect. I could not focus on the dialogue when she was on screen.
* Tatiana Romanova
* Sylvia Trench is back! I didn’t realize they tried to have continuity in early Bond films.
* Bond creams his jeans at the photo of Tatiana Romanova.
* The briefcase! Finally, some dumb Bond tech.
* Coffee, medium sweet — a Turkish coffee designation for how much sugar to brew it with
* “Gypsy blood feuds” — that’s a yikes.
* At least Bond gets to fuck both of the fighters.
* Woah, a full-fledged butt shot!
* This movie is exponentially hornier than Dr. No. I’m not mad.
* “James, will you make love to me all the time in England?” she says into the spy recording.
* The askew portrait of Lenin
* Bombing? No problem. Sewer rats? Get the hell out of there.
* Of course, it makes sense to put a spy in a négligée.
* Robert Shaw’s English accent is so absurd I thought he was faking it
* A helicopter AND a boat chase? That double budget paid off.
* “There’s a saying in England: ‘When there’s smoke, there’s fire.’”
* — “Horrible woman.” — “Yes, she’s had her kicks.” SMASH CUT TO BIRDS.
* A disembodied hand waves goodbye to a sex tape. THE END.
