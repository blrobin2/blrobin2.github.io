**Rating:** 1.5/5

Queer culture is two sewer boys

A set of identical twins, separated at birth, try to reunite their parents. The humor is very "lol so random" with a hefty pile of "if it's offensive, it's funny." But like Owen said after the movie, it's lazy, which is really what makes this a bad movie

Half star for Nathan Lane baby-birding ham to two shitty puppets
