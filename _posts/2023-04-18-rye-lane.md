Wow, this movie won me over so quickly

Vivian Oparah Is instantly charming — David Jonsson does neurotic without making it hammy

Great use of color and cinematic storytelling — Raine Allen-Miller takes the Before trilogy’s day-in-a-life structure and injects their perspective and sharp comedic timing

And I always love seeing London onscreen — I get the feeling I’m getting Miller’s tour of their neighborhood. The world is so lived-in and expresses so much personality in such a short time

It loses some momentum in the third act, where it falls into some clichés, but nothing offensive

A new rom-com classic
