**Rating:** 3.5/5

Ultra-rich guy (Christopher Abbot), who has a regularly scheduled dominatrix (Margaret Qualley), decides to call things off with her after he learns that he’ll be CEO of his now-deceased father’s company. But she isn’t ready to end things and won’t leave without a fight

Pretty fun movie, a little slow, with a lot of scenery chewing, especially from Margaret Qualley, and a couple of chuckles here and there. I enjoyed the directions it took — I probably wouldn’t watch it again, but I’m glad that I did
