**Rating:** 4/5

<blockquote><i> I've been with you your whole life — I was just somebody else</i></blockquote>In a town where girls go missing and folks have nosebleeds, Jonny (Kiah McKirnan) goes to live with her great aunt Hildie (Alicia Silverstone) and experiences her family birthright: Forevering — a profound, spectral empathy where she feels all the feelings.

If you've seen any of Jennifer Reeder's movies, you won't be totally thrown by this surreal, skewed world — symbolic, hyperbolic, shrouded in a coded language that conveys the themes better than standard dialogue.

My favorite scene is when she goes to a party and starts accidentally mirroring people's gestures as she walks through.

No words can convey what this movie's deal is — you just have to check it out
