**Rating:** 2/5

Oh, Brandon Lee: so pretty, and in so many terrible movies.

* Damn champagne flutes!
* Spice up your action movie with Ernest Borgnine ranting on a park bench!
* Are you insane? That's a suicide mission. I only do laser missions!
* Meanwhile, somewhereâ€¦
* Good work! Take an accent out of petty cash.
* Do they have any police in this police state?
* Yuck! She's turned on!
* Sign for the package â€” it's my dying wish!
* Laser mission, is that you??
* ðŸŽµ Mercenary man! He's a mercenary man!
