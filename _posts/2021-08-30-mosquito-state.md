**Rating:** 2/5

The characters are nothing, the politics are meaningless, the story has an outcome in mind with no idea for how it should be threaded

It’s pretty — and gross — to look at (especially the opening credit sequence), and it would’ve been more enjoyable if it has committed to more of the surreal dream-like qualities. There are a couple of well-conceived song choices, particularly the last song

Really feels like a wasted opportunity
