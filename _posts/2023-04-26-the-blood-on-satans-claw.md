Well, this certainly paints witchcraft in a negative light. It gets all muddled up with Satan worship, with the floral crowns and whatnot giving it all a pagan feel

Mysterious occurrences as people discover a strange corpse that disappears, and the claws of that corpse that compels the children to perform dark rituals on one another, practices that culminate in rape and murder

A man’s fiancé goes mad, but as the asylum takes her away, her hand appears as one with the same claws. Perhaps that “corpse” was not one after all?

When a family discovers their daughter has a patch of fur on her — the devil’s skin — the witch hunt begins

I like the idea of satanism being a disease that affects the body and compels you to worship Satan

The soundtrack oscillates between foreboding and whimsical, so some scenes feel goofy as a result

It meanders a bit, but it has some good moments throughout
