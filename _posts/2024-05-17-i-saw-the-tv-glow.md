**Rating:** 5/5

<blockquote><i>I couldn't sleep last night, so I started my favorite TV show again</i></blockquote>Growing up, TV felt more real than real life. Days felt like a liminal space — the waiting room for real life to begin. Years pass like seconds, and memory blurs and distorts.

Fathers were there as guards to ensure I lost any connection to myself. I sang along to a blink-182 song in the car, and my stepdad was so mad at how badly Tom DeLonge sang and how I sang. I kissed a boy on the playground, and my dad showed me two magnets — "See how they only attract when they're opposites?"

<blockquote><i>This isn't normal. This isn't how life is supposed to feel</i></blockquote>Memories are tied to products — a Veryfine fruit juice machine in the school cafeteria or an episode of Are You Afraid of the Dark I turned off because it was too scary. My best friend from elementary school is dead. So now he's a guitar riff from a Slayer song or Pyramid Head chasing me in Silent Hill 2.

Nostalgia is never for the thing itself — when I revisit things from my childhood, they're smaller, more pixelated, and embarrassing. Nostalgia is for the time when I felt more authentically me.

<blockquote><i>There is still time</i></blockquote><b>*** Spoilers ***</b>
* Tara from <i>Buffy</i>!
* Pete & Pete are the two zombies outside his house
* Mr. Melancholy is the moon monster from the Tonight, Tonight music video. There's even a cover of the song in the movie.
Every color is perfect and felt like a half-forgotten memory
