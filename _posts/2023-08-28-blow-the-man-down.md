**Rating:** 3.5/5

After her mother's wake, Mary Beth gets drunk at the bar. She talks to a guy who promises to give her a ride home, but when he pops the trunk, she sees blood, hair, and women's clothes. He chases her into the docks, where she kills him

She confides in her sister, Priscilla, who decides to help her dispose of the body, cutting him up with a knife, throwing him in a cooler, and tossing him into the sea

When a different body washes up on the shore the next day, we learn that things are not as simple as they seem

The film isn't a thriller so much as a character study, passing in circles as characters learn more information

The soundtrack of Sea Shanties works out pretty well, switching from diegetic to non-diegetic

Perfect ending! What a great little movie — such a welcome surprise 

<b>Stray Thoughts</b>
* "Go watch some TV. I TiVo'd some Buffy." — What year is this?
* Putting Marceline Hugot and Margo Martindale in the same movie is confusing. Could you imagine if Ann Dowd got in the mix?
