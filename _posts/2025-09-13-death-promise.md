**Rating:** 2.5/5

Whoa, this movie rules. The anti-landlord rhetoric is on point. The editing and fights are pretty tight. Well, except for the final battle — it's nonsense.

* I, too, find that random guys I beat up in the hallways don't know anything.
* I want to enroll my gun in karate class.
* You know what that kid'll do? He'll run off and get himself killed. Believe me, he's done it before.
* — It's no shame to get your ass kicked by Sugar Ray. — Anyone who listened to the radio in the 90s would strongly disagree.
