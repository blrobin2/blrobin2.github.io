The writers struggled with this episode since the movie had so much music and was trying to be funny. It's one of the writers's most loathed movies from Season 2 (except for Frank, who loves the worst movies).

I was too hard on this episode last time. The movie still sucks, but there are some funny jokes.

* Even THEY make me sick.
* Not nearly enough beautiful women for me.
* Just let it play out; I want all of that... humor...
* That's us, you fool! Itâ€™s an exterior shot!
* I'm afraid you boys will only find evil here.
* Haha, she has water in her lungs.
* I have no right to say this, but god, your hair smells good.
Take a rest. You've provided enough comic relief
