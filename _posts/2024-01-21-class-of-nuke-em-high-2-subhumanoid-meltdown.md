<blockquote><i>Come away, o human child! To the waters and the wild...</i> — W.B. Yeats</blockquote><blockquote><i>Come away, subhumanoid child! To the waters and the wild...</i> — M.T. Head </blockquote>Tromaville Nuclear Facility builds a junior college: The Tromaville Institute of Technology. They regularly delouse the students and clean up "harmless" toxic waste that makes it into the school.

This time, instead of The Cretins, we have The Squirrels, named ironically after the "innocent, nut-gathering" Tromaville squirrels.

Or are they??

If you thought the first movie was too subtle in its sense of humor, this movie goes above and beyond to ensure you know how unserious they are.

It also abandons almost any semblance of a plot.

As a result, it is much messier and bloated. AKA closer to the Troma quality I'm familiar with.

It's got a handful of weird little guys that I liked, especially Murray, the janitor subhumanoid.

#### Stray Thoughts/Spoilers

- Guest appearance by "Tromie" the Nuclear Squirrel
- So many gorgeous early '90s neons
- Roger, with the recorder, talks to Diane. Is this a <i>Twin Peaks</i> reference?
- So much expository narration
- Troma posters all over the place, including one for <i>Nuke 'Em High</i>
- "Boner appetit — a little condom humor"
- The belly button mouth
- The kid eats all that glass
- The stop-motion creatures are pretty cool
- Crossfade from two enormous breasts to the nuclear plant smokestacks
- Oh Diane's a real person
- Kaiju squirrel
