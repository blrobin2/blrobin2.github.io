Rad monster!

- Where’s the bouncing ball, are we supposed to be singing?
- Even he sufferered from terrible hemeroids
- Wait, this is Ancient Greece, they didn’t have ruins yet
- Have I mentioned I’m immense and immortal?
- Hercules now concludes his broadcast day
- Hey everybody, I just invented the shirt!
- Either this man is dead or my sundial has stopped
- Plan your revenge now, avoid the rush
- Ah, my spine!
- I know we’ve been dating for an hour, but I need my space
- We surrender! Anybody? We’re ready to be captured!
- Uh dad, let me guess — something's wrong?
