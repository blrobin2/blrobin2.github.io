Rad monster!

* Where’s the bouncing ball, are we supposed to be singing?
* Even he sufferered from terrible hemeroids
* Wait, this is Ancient Greece, they didn’t have ruins yet
* Have I mentioned I’m immense and immortal?
* Hercules now concludes his broadcast day
* Hey everybody, I just invented the shirt!
* Either this man is dead or my sundial has stopped
* Plan your revenge now, avoid the rush
* Ah, my spine!
* I know we’ve been dating for an hour, but I need my space
* We surrender! Anybody? We’re ready to be captured!
* Uh dad, let me guess — something's wrong?
