* Ice skaters, young and old, die from flashing blades!
* There's nothing prettier on a summer day than arterial spray on the fallen snow
* Here, Gertrude Stein shows her moves!
* It's never too early to fuse your spinal column together! In a few years, these kids will be addicted to pain pills
* Thank you Eugene Castle for making us laugh at winter again
