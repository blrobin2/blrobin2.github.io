Psychedelic colors and downbeat funk as masked bikers ride slowly through a graveyard. Their helmets and goggles resemble skulls. Their jackets read "The Living Dead," spelled out in bones.

Tom, the leader of the gang, talks with his girlfriend Abby, who is also in the gang, about killing themselves and crossing over.

<blockquote><i>— Sometimes, you scare me.
</i><i>— It's not me who scares you. It's the world.</i></blockquote>Tom questions his mother, who is a medium, and Shadwell, the family butler:

"Why did my dad die in that locked room? How is it, Shadwell, that you don't get any older? And what's the secret of the living dead?" he asks while scarfing down a hoagie.

Tom demands to go into the locked room. When he enters, the door disappears. He has a frog pendant meant to keep him safe.

The mirror stops reflecting him and becomes a window. The mirror smokes, and a Frog God appears to him. He has a vision of his mother signing a pact with the Frog God. Then, the revelation — to come back from the dead, you must believe that you will return.

The Living Dead terrorizes the town, running from the fuzz before Tom rides off the bridge and dies.

The gang buries him at Seven Witches. Sure enough, he returns. And he's killing anyone who gets in his way.

The gang — with excellent names like Hatchet, Chopped Meat, and Gash — decides to join him once they see it's possible.

<blockquote><i> Oh man, what are we waiting for?</i></blockquote>That is, everyone except for Abby.

What a fun movie! And it has an absolutely bananas ending. It's a bit tedious at points, but the plot is surprisingly structured for such a kooky idea.
