By expanding the <i>Gamera</i> mythos and acknowledging his destructive nature, the movie gets to tell a more complex story

Also this one has way more monster gore, with Gyaos rotting and eyeballs falling out of their sockets, and Gamera bleeding a whole bunch of green

And there’s a Sega Dreamcast game in the movie that is a significant plot point, which rules

The heavier reliance on CGI for the final battle is kind of a bummer but I understand the need in order to up the ante from the previous movies

Still, best Gamera movie I’ve seen this far
