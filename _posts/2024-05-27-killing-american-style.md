<b><a href="https://boxd.it/rIGbC/detail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cult Movie Challenge 2024 | 22/52 | Robert Z'Dar</a></b>

Tony Stone comes to John Lynch's club with a big job — rob an ice cream factory. They have 22 trucks — that's so much ice cream money! A guard lets them in, and they make it in and out with two casualties.

The factory owner catches on that the guard was part of it, and the guard spills the beans on Tony's gang. The police find Tony and Lynch and send them to maximum security prison.

But before the bus can get there, Tony's men trick the bus into stopping, and they escape. With nowhere to run, they find a farmhouse full of bikini-clad babes and hold them hostage.

Meanwhile, the police work to track down the fugitives.

This movie sucks, and I love it! I've never seen Robert Z'Dar speak so much.

Honestly, after 40 minutes, this becomes pretty unbearable.
