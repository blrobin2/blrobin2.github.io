<blockquote><i>It's like this — we live in claustrophobia, a land of steel and concrete, trapped by dark waters. There is no escape, nor do we want to. We've come to thrive on it and each other. You can't get the adrenaline pumping without the terror, good people. I love this town.</i></blockquote>
Ah, Manhattan. Land of punks and robbers. Rats bathe in sewer water while junkies heat their spoons by candlelight.

Anyway, we won't be in Manhattan for most of this movie, but on a cruise full of graduates heading towards Manhattan. An anchor drops on a power line, which happens to run under Jason's dead body. The anchor triggers a power surge. Jason's body convulses to life.

<blockquote><i>— This voyage is doomed!
</i><i>— Yeah, tell me about it.</i></blockquote>

#### Stray Thoughts / Spoilers

- Toby, the dog, is such a sweetie!

- Nothing says romance like a Statue of Liberty necklace.
- This movie does everything in its power to remind you that it's 1989
- That pink Flying V guitar rules
- J.J. is so cool
- Is Rennie psychic, too?? But wait, Toby also sees it??
- Sauna rock in the stomach is brutal
- Woah, Rennie's visions rule
- The staging of the dance floor murder is confusing
- So, wait, is the deckhand assisting Jason??
- Fake rowing until Lewis hits his mark
- I started drifting out around this time. The movie is way too long.
