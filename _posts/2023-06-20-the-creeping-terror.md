**Rating:** 0.5/5

* The unbearable whiteness of being
* You mind helping me out and climbing up on here?
* The first director to realize the dramatic potential of a rectal thermometer
* Uh oh, Bobby shed his antlers 
* Did anyone in the 50s ever think of running?
* Everyone back then was 40
* When a monster and a small car love each other very much…
* Actual dialogue startled everyone!
