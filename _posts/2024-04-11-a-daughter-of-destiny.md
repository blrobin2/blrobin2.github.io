<blockquote><i>In the early Middle Ages, the legend of the mandrake was born. According to legend, its root transforms into a human being. At night, one seeks the root. When the clock strikes midnight, one buries the spade beneath the gallows. The magical power of the mandrake root brings luck to men but also misfortunes and pain.</i></blockquote>

Professor Briken is a scientist famed for his experiments regarding genetics and heredity.

He declares to his peers his intentions to experiment with the mandrake.

He plans to impregnate a sex worker with a mandrake to observe the child's innate behavior and its environmental influence. No plant shows intention in its behavior, so why should a mandrake?

The story shares similarities with <i>Poor Things</i> â€” a woman conceived by a scientist's experiments escapes from his possessive household and has many sexual escapades while discovering her identity.

Here, the daughter Alarune's lack of empathy leads her to seduce and destroy men. Because I guess that's men's biggest fear.

Legend suggests the mandrake springs from a hanged man's semen, although the film doesn't explicitly state it. How very middle ages.

Different versions exist, but all derive from one Italian translation. If you can find one with some music added, I recommend it. This movie is already difficult to watch.

I've heard of a better cut, but it's not online. So, based on the one I saw, this movie is... fine. Brigitte Helm is a gift. This plot is a whole thing.

By the way, I retranslated the opening quote because the German-to-Italian-to-English one I read was a whole mouthful. It's probably less accurate, but oh well! What are you going to do? Kill me?
