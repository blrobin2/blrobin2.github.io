Scott Bruin is an LA photographer. Like every photographer, he's also secretly fucking his models. He tells lightbulb jokes while they fuck, which makes any woman horny.

When he sleeps, he has nightmares of murdering someone. He proceeds to choke the model he's fucking before waking up.

He walks along Muscle Beach to clear his head. He reads about murder. Just, like, murder in general. His therapist tells him that it's not a big deal and he should stop worrying about it.

It keeps leaking into his life, interfering with his work. He tips an unhoused man to tell him if he's crazy. They sleep together on the bench and get pizza the next day.

Through an air-sprayed t-shirt and a restraining order, Scott tracks down Kimberly, the woman from his dreams. He's falling for her, but her behavior is sometimes unexplainable.

The visuals get so trippy! VHS effects and wavy distortions, like footage from an old computer game.

This movie is so whacky. It's also way too long. I got so many laughs from this movie, all at the movie's expense.
