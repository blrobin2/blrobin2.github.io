Puss in Boots is on his last life, so he chases after a fabled star capable of giving one wish. Along the way, he makes friends and enemies, and everyone’s motivations are challenged — except for Perrito, who already had everything he wanted

Solid animation and the style flourishes were neat, but they felt unmotivated. I wish a love story did not take over the trajectory of the story, but it’s a kid's movie, so it’s allowed to take tired narrative exits

I may have been more excited about this one if I had seen it in theaters, but today it rolled off me. I suspect its legacy will be, “Remember when a kid’s animation studio tried a little?”
