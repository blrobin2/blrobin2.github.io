A multiverse of reviews:

1. The pathos of Rick and Morty meets the pacing of The Fountain
2. One million Letterboxd users can’t be wrong
3. When you have nothing to say and the visual budget of a Marvel movie to say it
4. What’s funnier than a brief gag? A labored one with a 3 act structure
5. If queer kids would just accept their given family’s abuses, they would find the love and acceptance they were looking for all along
