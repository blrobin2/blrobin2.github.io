There is a version of this movie I could appreciate, but it would require the men writing and directing it to give the characters more than "angry independent woman" and "boy who cries and cares too much." The leads had no chemistry, either, so it was near impossible to fall for their romance.

I probably would have stuck it out, but who I saw it with was done with the movie when Florence Pugh berated Andrew Garfield for confessing his feelings for her.
