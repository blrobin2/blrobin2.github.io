"When I Held Your Brain in My Heart" is The Ink Spots song I didn't know I needed

The movie isn't much, but there are a couple of pretty cool shots and ideas

* Furnace repairman from the year 5000!
* Exposition!
* I better have my hair sharpened while I'm out
* Did he make a reservation? This movie is full of plot holes!
* Oh great a sparrow from the year 5000 crashed into the window
* Always dive head-first into an unfamiliar lake
* ðŸŽµjazz jazz jazz jazz jazz
* Alan Parsons works on his greatest album
* I have a feeling that part of the answer is still in those boxes at the bottom of the pond or its blowin in part of the wind
* The nurse is coming from inside the house!
* Can I have my face back?
* Remember! Moisturize and always use a sunscreen!
