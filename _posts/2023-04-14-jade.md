I remember my dad renting this movie when it came out around the time of my parent’s divorce. When I picked it up and looked at it, he told me a friend recommended it and that it was terrible. I didn’t believe him until now

It’s so funny how inept this movie is. The dialog is goofy as hell; it’s like a middle schooler trying to sound tough. The camera doesn’t know what to do with the sex and nudity; it observes like a cop on a crime scene: detached and a little disgusted

There are some incredible car stunts, and almost all are unintentionally funny. So many cars fly over San Francisco hills, a la Crazy Taxi!

I can track along with the plot until the last 20 minutes… admittedly, a very giallo move to twist into nonsense

This is Friedkin’s favorite movie that he made… I guess he was too close to it, couldn’t see what he missed, and assumed it was there

This movie is so bad. I love it

- The blood looks glossy; I kind of dig it
- Everyone says “god-damn it” constantly, and no one sounds natural saying it
- “Cristal, Beluga, Wolfgang Puck… it’s a fuck-house,” sighs David Caruso as he digs through a crime scene mini-fridge
