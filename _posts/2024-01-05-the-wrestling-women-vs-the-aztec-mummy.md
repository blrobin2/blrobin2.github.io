Loretta Venus and Golden Rubi are two wrestlers and maybe Amazon women.

Dr. Sorva comes to see Loretta's husband, whose Uncle Luis is an archeologist, to discuss a codex that leads to an Aztec treasure

They swore to secrecy, but Black Dragon is torturing and killing every archeologist until he finds the one with the codex.

Before he can finish, a man shoots a blow dart through the window, killing Dr. Sorva.

The women wrestlers and their archeologist friends must find the codex before Black Dragon does. Who knows what secrets lie in the Aztec pyramids?

Well, if the title wasn't a big enough hint, it's a mummy.
<blockquote><i>— Can you explain it, Uncle Luis?
</i><i>— Nope! It makes no sense. So, that mummy is supernatural</i></blockquote>The movie has radio serial energy. The plot changes by the minute, and much of the plot develops through exposition.

On the plus side, it's hard to get bored. Well, except for the wrestling matches. They wrestle a la G.L.O.W., but the fights are long.

It's not that good, but it's great for a laugh, even if it stops making sense by the end.



<b>Thoughts / Spoilers</b>
* "Now watch me as I dominate this girl's will"
* A secret message sent through a sombrero
* The villains are a bunch of Hispanic people playing East Asian characters. They keep their eyes partially closed, and it just looks like they're sleepy.
* Thankfully, only one gang member carries a gun, so the wrestlers can easily fight the others
* They bet a part of the codex on the wrestlers vs Black Dragon's judo-trained sisters.
* "As<i> </i>an Amazon, you're the greatest"
* The Black Dragon's sidekick is named Mao
* Wait, if there are more pieces to the codex, how did they translate with just one piece?
* "[finds skeleton] Looks dead to me, professor"
* The mummy can take any animal form. So, it takes a bat shape. It also sleeps during the day and attacks at night.
* Charlotte keeps passing out from fright
* The wrestling women never wrestle the Aztec mummy :(
