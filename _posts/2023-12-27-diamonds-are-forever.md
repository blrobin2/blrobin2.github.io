Stray Thoughts/Spoilers:</b>
* Straight out of the gate, Bond strangling a woman with her bikini top.
* The most iconic Bond theme.
* Went and Kidd are total dopes.
* [Sean Connery voice] Hovercraft
* Tiffany Case
* Plenty O’Toole
* A caged black woman turning into a gorilla at Circus Circus.
* Plenty O’Toole’s body tied up in the pool — the most overtly horny murder I’ve seen in a Bond.
* Why are the astronauts moving so slow? They’re not actually in outer space!
* The car-on-two-wheels stunt — the car enters on the right side and exits on the left
* Scaling the casino is a good set piece. It’s the most spy-crafty thing Bond has done in ages.
* The cassette tape of “World’s Greatest Marches.”
* Blofeld in drag
* If they could have just blown up the oil rig to stop the laser, why was Bond there, let alone the tape mishap?
* They did Tiffany Case dirty. She went from cunning to airhead by the end.
