<b><a href="https://boxd.it/rIGbC/detail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cult Movie Challenge 2024 | 52/52 | Bruno Mattei</a></b>

We open on an elaborate setup with a show rehearsal, but it's just fodder for a woman changing and two murder scenes, each performed by a killer in a monster mask with clawed gloves.

Melanie sends her daughter, Clarissa, to a friend's place. With the house to herself, she makes herself a sandwich and sits on the couch to watch TV. But they're talking about the masked killer, which freaks Melanie out. Then, she gets a call from her drunk husband. She tells him to stop calling her.

For whatever reason, Melanie pulls out her breasts and looks at them in the mirror for a bit. Then, she receives a separate, much more obscene phone call from someone else. She reports it to the police. Then, they call again. From the house phone. And then walk in while on the phone. It's the monster mask guy, surprise. He lifts his mask, but the camera pushes in so we can only see her dead-eyed stare.

Cut to the hospital. Melanie has somehow survived the killer's attack. Detective Clark and Dr. Willow are on the case. But there's only one problemâ€”Melanie has amnesia from the experience and cannot remember her name, let alone the identity of the killer. If she's still alive, though, the killer will try coming for her again. Will Clark and Willow be able to stop him in time?

Claudio Fragasso, who also wrote and directed <i>Troll 2</i>, showcases a similar tin ear for dialogue, poor comprehension of story, and inability to direct tone changes. Folks speculate on whether Fragasso is aware he's making terrible movies, but to arrive at this movie intentionally is a feat no irony-poisoned trash director has managed.

The movie will cut to random murder scenes unrelated to the main story. I assume that these are Bruno Mattei's contributions.

The detective's, "Fuck!" is an all-timer for me. I laughed so hard.

If you love terrible movies, this one has a lot to offer. It's fucking abysmal, and I had a great time.
