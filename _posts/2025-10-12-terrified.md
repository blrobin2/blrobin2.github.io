<b>Okay, I guess I hate myself, here we go.</b>

A television program speaks with the sole survivor of the Miles County Massacre, whose face has been horribly disfigured. The killer is Art the Clown, whom the public believes died, but the coroner reports the body missing the morning after the attack. Art the Clown is the one who is watching the TV program. Through the credits, Art assembles his bag of torture implements. The woman with the disfigured face mutilates the TV host.

We meet Tara and Dawn (the names are likely Buffy send-ups, right?), out for Halloween, who run into Art the Clown. Art proceeds to kill a bunch of people around them. Is one of them the disfigured survivor? Or is it someone Tara and Dawn cross paths with?

Yep, it's a loose setup for gory kills. Art isn't getting revenge, isn't some reanimated spirit, or whatever. He's just a dude who loves killing.

<blockquote><i>Is there kindness in you? Somewhere in your heart? Can you show no mercy?</i></blockquote>

I understand that I should see this as an homage to 80s slashers, but most 80s slashers had some character development, hell, even a plot or two. Heck, part of the appeal of the slasher is the creative kill. This movie is a demo reel of effects, more concerned with rendering realistic torture and murder than any creative endeavor. The result is a movie that loses all tension in the pursuit of nausea.

The movie's one mercy is that the gore is cheap. Also, why does it feel so long?
