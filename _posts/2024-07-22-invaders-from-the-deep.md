**Rating:** 2/5

The first episode of the show! Found a new source so I'm going back to watch the episodes I missed. Joel doesn't have robots in the opening, and there are no segments beyond the opening and closing. He doesn't enter the theater to watch the movie until after the opening scene and credits. Crow comes in 30 minutes into the movie.

There's a "Place Commercial Here" sign for the ad breaks. They also do the robot sickness bit from the unaired pilot.

The movie is four episodes of the supermarionation show Stingray stapled together. It feels like a Hanna-Barbera show a la Sealab 2020, but with marionettes. Appropriate that the first movie they watch stars puppets. Also, they do a lot of Gerry Anderson stuff this season.
