**Rating:** 1.5/5

This movie fundamentally changed me as a human being when I first saw it. It's one of those movies where the <i>MST3K</i> commentary doesn't add that much humor â€” the movie is outrageous as is.

* Tonight, on Old Lady Gets Killed
* You're welcome
* I got old and roasted the cat with my breath but I'm fine
* Based on a story by Sigmund Freud
* Son, if you hold the lid open, we'll bury him at sea
* Remember to believe in magic, or I'll kill you
