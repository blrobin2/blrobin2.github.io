**Rating:** 2.5/5

Dude, the cold open to the smoothest '80s guitar put me in such a positive mood. I guess it's the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhQMHYmS7ig">Theme from Light Blast by Guido & Maurizio de Angelis</a>.

The people-melting effects are cheap, but wildly gross for what otherwise feels like a police procedural.

I finally got the attraction to Erik Estrada. It only took him fighting in his underwear.

* Light Blast: all the great taste of Blast, but only half the calories.
* We can listen to people bone—we have the technology.
* Hey angel, I finally showered like you asked.
* You wanna bring society to its knees? Threaten the stunt car shows in Oakland.
* Is it possible these stunt cars are doing too many stunts?
* "Camera man still on top" is the name of my Ansel Adams rock opera.
* It's just nice to be around a fuck-ton of large vehicles.
* Rich Corinthian Leather Blast
* Ow, right in the CHIPs!
* Did cocaine design that car?
