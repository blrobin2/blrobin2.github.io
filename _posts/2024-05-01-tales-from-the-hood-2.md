<b><a href="https://boxd.it/pRFMi/detail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hooptober 5.0 | 32/32 | Bonus 2/2</a></b>

This movie is more explicit about its intended black audience. Also, the film is more comedic, with only the last segment having a serious tone.

Your enjoyment of this movie will depend on your sense of humor. I didn’t find it funny, but I (mostly) liked the ideas.

<b>Robo Hell \*\*.5</b>

<blockquote><i>Yeah, the shit! The doo-doo! The poopity pop!</i></blockquote>

Dumass Beach is a private prison operator. He is working with a team to train robots as law enforcement officers. He hires storytellers to train robots to distinguish criminals. If Dumass had his way, anyone black would fit the bill.

He hires Mr. Simms, suggesting “Black Lives Matter” as the theme.

Keith David brings his flavor to Mr. Simms — not as unhinged as Clarence Williams III, but with more overt malevolence.

<b>Good Golly \*\*\*</b>

<blockquote><i>I don’t see it as racist — just a warm, comforting part of my childhood</i></blockquote>

Audrey and Philip, white siblings, go on a vacation with Philip’s black girlfriend, Zoe. Aubrey and Philip visit the Museum of Negrosity. Audrey tries to buy a golliwog doll for her collection, but the curator, Floyd, refuses for obvious reasons.

So, they break into the museum to steal the doll. However, the doll has an agenda.

This short is a spiritual sequel to “KKK Comeuppance” from the first film, including one doll from the story in the display cases.

The gore is so over-the-top, it’s pretty wild.

<b>The Medium \*\*</b>

<blockquote><i>People who eat glass in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones</i></blockquote>

Cliff Bettis used to be a pimp but has turned to legitimate business. Three men kidnap and torture Cliff to get his money. He wants to be a benevolent rich person and put the money into magnet schools and whatnot, but one man accidentally beats Cliff to death.

With no lead, they turn to a TV psychic and demand he channel Cliff’s spirit. They might achieve their desires, but not in the desired manner.

This story goes for more overt comedy to mixed results. Bryan Batt, in particular, is way too hammy. And they have him playing straight??

<b>Date Night \*\*.5</b>

<blockquote><i>— What in the world is smegma?
— [seductively] I’ll show you later</i></blockquote>

Ty and Kahad go out on dates with Carmen and Liz. Ty lied to them about Ty and Kahad being an agent and casting director. After partying for a bit, Ty drugs their drinks and sets up a camera to film having sex with the unconscious girls.

But the girls also lied about their identities.

They play multiple rounds of Cards Against Humanity on screen, and it’s the most upsetting thing in the movie.

<b>The Sacrifice \*\*\*</b>

<blockquote><i>Respect the sacrifices given to you</i></blockquote>

The story switches between 1955 and the present day. In 1955, two white men kidnap Emmett Till, beating and lynching him for speaking to a white girl. In the present day, Emily, a pregnant white woman, keeps having a dream where Emmett tells her he isn’t sure if they deserve a baby.

Her black husband, Henry, is a councilman supporting a Republican gubernatorial candidate. They host a fundraiser at their house, where the candidate talks about taking Mississippi back to its core values. Emily makes an announcement. Emmett has chosen to live, so their baby must die.

Henry’s world changes as people see him as they would in 1955. To fix it, he must face the ghosts of victims of anti-black hate crimes.
