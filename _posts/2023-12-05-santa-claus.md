<b>The Devil and Santa are Raging Inside Me</b>

I remember loving how cuckoo this movie is. Another instance where I saw the movie separate from <i>MST3K</i>.

* I saw mommy KILLING Santa Claus underneath the mistletoe last MURDER
* Santa Claus vs. The Aztec Mummy
* Do you think it's a good idea to jingle ALL the way?
* Action Jesus: manger sold separately
* Santa flew 23 missions on Korea
* So is this neorealism?
* That Lucifer is like Satan... from Hell!
* Santa's tendrils reach far and wide
* — Watch out Santa, they'll see you! — That's the last thing they'll ever see
* In the name of Santa, Merlin, and the elves. Amen.
