<b>The Devil and Santa are Raging Inside Me</b>

I remember loving how cuckoo this movie is. Another instance where I saw the movie separate from <i>MST3K</i>.

- I saw mommy KILLING Santa Claus underneath the mistletoe last MURDER
- Santa Claus vs. The Aztec Mummy
- Do you think it's a good idea to jingle ALL the way?
- Action Jesus: manger sold separately
- Santa flew 23 missions on Korea
- So is this neorealism?
- That Lucifer is like Satan... from Hell!
- Santa's tendrils reach far and wide
- — Watch out Santa, they'll see you! — That's the last thing they'll ever see
- In the name of Santa, Merlin, and the elves. Amen.
