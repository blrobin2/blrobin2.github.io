**Rating:** 3.5/5

You can draw a straight line between this and The Last Angel of History: an entity comes from the future to take real events and construct a new future from the narratives of the past. This is far more subdued, resembling the minimal style of many contemporary documentaries — so much so that I found it hard to follow for a good part of the film, but it all comes together in the end
