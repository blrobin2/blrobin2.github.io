**Rating:** 4.5/5

Rudolf and Hedwig have their ideal life. They have a big house for all of their children. They have a beautiful yard with a pool and a garden.

Of course, there's that pesky wall, but they planted some vines and greenery that should cover it soon. And the shouts and gunshots fade into the background after a while. When the incinerator runs at night, it blights the sky red, but you get used to it

Life next to Auschwitz is everything Hedwig dreamed life could be.

The film quality has a strange BBC frame rate that took a bit to get used to. Some scenes are also in infrared, which won't surprise anyone who watched Glazer's short, <i>The Fall</i>.

The score is ruptured and unsettling â€” the movie has a captivating opening overture.

This movie is a nightmare encoded in banality.
