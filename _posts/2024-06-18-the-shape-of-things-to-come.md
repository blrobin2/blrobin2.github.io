Emily episode! I hate these cold opens! Gun to my head, if I had to pick one host going forward, it would be Emily. But please don't put a gun to my head.

I love the movie's art direction! It's like Star Wars ships, Logan's Run civilian wear, Ultraman spacesuits, and Phantom Planet robots. Jack Pallance wears a purple cape! Anne-Marie Martin's hair is immaculate.

- The spirograph has been compromised!

- — Humpty Dumpty had a great fall — Do not mock my pain
- God it burns, when will I learn?
- Jim Henson's Sniper Babies
- Drop the beat! Drop the beat! For the love of god, drop the beat!
