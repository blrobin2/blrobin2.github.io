**Rating:** 4/5

Life is what happens when you’re busy making plans and no longer praying to god

I cried — Hans Zimmer played up the schmaltz, but the movie found some real emotional moments and took the time to earn them. Obviously, there wasn’t a whole lot for me to relate to, but the performances kept me locked in

The most relatable scene to me was going to a party in middle school where we did the “go in a room with another person and … 😏” and Anna Smith and I just banged on the door and yelled a bunch, because god made me scared of sex/desire/whatnot

Benny Safdie and Rachel McAdams are the parents we all wish we could have — they’re not perfect, but damn, are they trying

The grandparents are my grandparents, who still give me Max Lucado books for Christmas. One time they gave me a desk organizer, and I really needed one, so I was so thankful, and I could tell how mad they were that it was that and not <i>God Will Carry You Through</i> that received such thanks

Happy I saw this in a theater full of weepies like me
