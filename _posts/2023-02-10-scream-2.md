**Rating:** 3.5/5

“Red Right Hand” playing in the theater? Immediately on board

Dave Matthews Band playing at the frat party? I’m waning…

Greek tragedy starring our lead? I’m back, baby

The first killer reveal? You’re losing me…

Second killer reveal? “There you go, nailed it kid,” I say to the significantly older Wes Craven
