<blockquote><i>Are you talking to me? I don't understand what you're saying, but it sounds wonderful.</i></blockquote>

In 1986, Professor Paris Catalano (Christopher Plummer) travels to Venice to follow Nosferatu (Klaus Kinski). Records mention seeing him at Carnival in 1786, during the plague.

The fact this movie functions at all is shocking. Kinski did everything possible to make everyone in the crew miserable. It went through several directors' hands, most leaving because of Kinski.

Augusto Caminito directed, and Luigi Cozzi helped as the second unit director.

After six weeks, Caminito couldn't take it anymore and finished the movie despite not filming large swaths of the script.

What helps this movie work is the diet Gothic mood. What kills it is Kinski's refusal to look or act like Nosferatu. Instead, he's just some horny dude who hangs out and fucks.

Overall, it's an incomplete movie â€” characters die and appear at random, and nothing ties together. I can get down with vibes. But it's hard to vibe when you're still figuring out what's happening.
