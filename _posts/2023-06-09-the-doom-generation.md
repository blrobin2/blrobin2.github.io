“Ever feel like reality is more twisted than dreams?”

Two industrial goth kids run into the most chaotic bisexual, and the world turns hostile on them at every motel and convenience store. On the run, killing and shacking up, their fate is sealed in anti-queer America as they try to figure out what they want and what it all means.

So funny! Everyone is so hot in this — Jonathon Schaech could have chemistry with a Doritos bag — and extremely violent in places.

James Duval in a Ministry tee shirt. Parker Posey in heart sunglasses wielding a katana. If that doesn’t sell you, then I don’t want to know you.

In some ways, I hate how it ends, but it also — relatively speaking — makes the most sense. I also like how open-ended some of the plot points end up being. There’s room for several interpretations, as well as none — it’s all oblivion.

So glad that Criterion Channel has the new uncut version of the movie! I don’t know how I’d feel about it if I saw the R-rated cut. As it stands, probably my favorite road movie, at least for the moment.
