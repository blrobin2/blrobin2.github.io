**Rating:** 3/5

Yes, it has themes — something something grief, yadda yadda yadda surveillance — but it's so clumsily compiled that it's hard to appreciate the genuine emotion Cronenberg put into it. I love the concept and the story itself, but the way it's told is all tell and no show, when several of the tells would be more effective as shows.

All I can guess is that this movie had no budget and no time because both could have solved the screenplay issues and the overall pacing.

I love Cronenberg—<i>Crimes of the Future</i> and <i>Videodrome</i> are all-timers. Maybe I came in with too high of expectations. I still liked it, but nowhere near as other folks seem to.

Diane Kruger is fantastic in this, though!
