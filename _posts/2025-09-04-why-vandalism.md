Why did this short go so hard on the cinematography?

- The music suggests we'll take a fair and balanced look at vandalism and how bad the people who do it are.
- Looks like Jeff will have to find another dog to vandalize.
- Don Cardiff, teenage detective.
- Oop, classic sneaking music! You'd think guards would notice it by now.
