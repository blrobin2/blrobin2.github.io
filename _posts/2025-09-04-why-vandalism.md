**Rating:** /5

Why did this short go so hard on the cinematography?

* The music suggests we'll take a fair and balanced look at vandalism and how bad the people who do it are.
* Looks like Jeff will have to find another dog to vandalize.
* Don Cardiff, teenage detective.
* Oop, classic sneaking music! You'd think guards would notice it by now.
