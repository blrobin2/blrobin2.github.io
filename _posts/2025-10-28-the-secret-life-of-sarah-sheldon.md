Cherrie sits beneath grapes on the vine. She grabs a bunch and brings them in to share with Alex by the fireside. Alex puts on a condom and the two have sex. Cherrie has initial difficulty with the size of Alex's penis. Alex gets a little more dominant and tries to give Cherrie some pain meds before doing something with his genitals that makes Julia scream out in pain. It sounds like his penis, um, growls. She runs into the bathroom and locks herself in as she hemorrhages. Alex slams on the door, claiming he can stop the bleeding.

Sarah leaves her girlfriend, Lisa, at the abortion clinic, not upset about the infidelity, but the fact that Lisa got pregnant. Sarah arrives at Alex's, furious that he left Cherrie in the bathroom to die. She does what she can for Cherrie, but it's too late. Alex is distraught, but Sarah is more frustrated by the inconclusiveness of their experiment. You see, Sarah surgically attached to Alex a penis with teeth, meant to sterilize the woman who receives it. But she didn't mean for it to do this. And after tonight, Alex wants it removed.

So, Sarah puts Alex under, grabs the hedge clippers, and cuts the creature off. She observes as it growls and slams against the jar it's kept in.

Written, directed by, and starring Annette Ashlie Slomka, this movie is one of those bizarro passion projects that usually don't get much circulation. So, thank you to <a href="https://boxd.it/2rCpB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Outrage</a> for making this hard-to-find movie available!

The core and structure of this movie aren't great. The lighting is rough, and many of the most heightened scenes are challenging to see. The pacing is almost non-existent — scenes just start and stop. The line readings are hysterical, syphoning off what tension the film manages to build. Here's a sample:

- "Your experiment failed. Long live overpopulation!"
- "Get your dirty as shit hands off my shit, man!"
- "Those lemon pies of yours — are they deliciously sweet?"
- "Whatever happened to profound conversations and… the discovery of inner truth… and spirituality?"
- "I just think it's great you're so passionate about science… and medicine… and experimentation."
- "We need more support and to sexually alter as many guys as possible."
- "You haven't experienced a stallion until you've felt this Italian sausage."

That said, this movie makes some off-the-wall choices that help this stand out.

The score has moments I like, and some that made me laugh so hard. In the bar, when Sarah is talking to the guy with the "Italian sausage," the raging, horny guitar solo in the background nearly overwhelms the dialogue.

The "creature" design is kind of amazing. The penis head opens like a snake's mouth. Kudos to them for showing it at all (Teeth would never). And where they decide to take it (no spoilers) is inspired.
