Lotte Reiniger pioneered the earliest silhouette animations, this being the earliest surviving one from 1926

Insanely beautiful and intricate animation, with excellent character design and fluid motion that sometimes feels human. Story-wise, it's all familiar territory

Maybe I’ve seen one other silhouette animation film, and it was in school or on PBS?

It doesn’t seem intentional, but there’s a scene where the magician on Magic Mountain summons a bow from below the screen, and the cells slip and become visible, giving a sort of meta feel, as though he summoned it from outside the film itself
