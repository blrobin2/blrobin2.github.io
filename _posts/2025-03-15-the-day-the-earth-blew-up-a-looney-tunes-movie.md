**Rating:** 3.5/5

Farmer Jim raised Daffy Duck and Porky Pig from duckling and suckling, respectively. When he went to that great farm in the sky, he left his house to the two, telling them, "As long as you stick together, you'll be alright."

As adults, they have trouble keeping the house together. It doesn't help that an alien asteroid wrecked their roof. So, to help pay for the damages, Daffy and Porky get jobs at the local gum factory. Things are looking up for the two, especially when Porky meets Petunia, the weirdo nerd of his dreams.

But things go south when Daffy discovers a secret alien plot to infect the gum and, thereby, all of planet Earth. Will Porky and Daffy be able to save everyone?

This movie was such a pleasant surprise. Farmer Jim is the funniest character the Looney Tunes have ever put on screen. The movie is perverted in the way classic Looney Tunes wasâ€”if Daffy is good at anything, it's yanking a lever.

Owen and I laughed throughout. Afterward, another enthusiastic audience member stood up and said, "That was awesome! Tell everyone you know to go see this!"

So here I am, telling you to see a Looney Tunes movie in the year of our lord 2025 that is actually very good.
