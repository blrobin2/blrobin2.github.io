Ah, Edgewood Entertainment. You gave me <a href="https://boxd.it/5VTZmb"><i>Time Chasers</i></a> and <a href="https://boxd.it/9fZVEB"><i>Icebreaker</i></a>. And now <i>Radical Jack</i>? Surely, this is hell.

I guess Billy Ray Cyrus filmed the <i>Mulholland Dr.</i> pilot and felt he was finally ready for a leading actor role.

So many Rifftrax reference jokes from this movie, like the obsession with Asahi.

* Don't break my nose! My achey breaky nose!
* Be sure to tell everyone a bearded lunatic in the woods gave you money for ice cream.
* Yeah! Let's toast this moment with a round of fine Japanese lager. Am I right, bros? You know what brand I mean!
* The circular saw reminds him of his wife and daughterâ€”what the hell did he do to them??
* Never mess with a man whose goatee is THIS precise.
