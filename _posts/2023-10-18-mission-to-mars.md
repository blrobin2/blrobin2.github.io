Some astronauts have a BBQ before going on a big Mars mission.

We’re on Mars and the astronauts see a mountain in front of them. As they approach, sands swirl like a cyclone, driving further and further into the air, worming into a monster, killing several men. Don Cheadle survives.

Where the mountain was, we see a giant stone face.

NASA sends a rescue team for Don Cheadle. Though they have some issues along the way, their biggest surprise comes when they find Don Cheadle and learn what he has discovered.

I’ve only seen the end of the movie. Turns out, you don’t need to see the rest of the movie — it changes nothing about it.

I’m sure this is the movie Elon Musk saw and said, “See, I told you it was possible!”

The special effects are pretty good for 2000, even if what they’re depicting is silly.

For a space movie, this isn’t all that fun or interesting.

#### SPOILERS

The creation museum ending is so half-baked that it makes all the build-up to it a bummer. Also, the filmmakers put so much of the film following their trouble getting there. And it doesn’t matter (beyond Tim Robbins’ character dying).

Compare this with a similar movie, <i>Contact</i>, and you can see how uninspired and flat this movie is.
