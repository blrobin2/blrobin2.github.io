<i>The Washing Machin</i>e is a giallo <i>Rashomon</i> about three sisters who live together â€” one of the sisters finds Yuri, the pimp/boyfriend of another sister, dead in a washing machine

Inspector Alexander Stacev investigates and finds no body and no crime, but like William Fontaine de La Tour Dauterive and the Chicks, the sisters will not leave him alone

This movie is one of the most outrageous giallo I've seen. Everyone is ridiculous and half-naked most of the runtime while Claudio Simonetti's synth theme grooves along

Gore-wise, it's surprisingly tame except for one gnarly scene in the middle

Is this good? I don't know! Was I laughing throughout most of it? Hell yeah
