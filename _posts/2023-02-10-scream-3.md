**Rating:** 3/5

I yelled out, “oh bangs!” when Courtney Cox came on screen

The action was so slapstick in this. Jump scares every time someone ran into someone, people booping theirs heads, punches and pratfalls, I laughed so often

I like the doubling, the mimicking, the echoing. It’s been done to death, but I’m a sucker

Maybe I have a high tolerance for horror movie bullshit, maybe it’s because I just watched the 2nd one, or maybe it’s because Parker Posey is in it, but I enjoyed it
