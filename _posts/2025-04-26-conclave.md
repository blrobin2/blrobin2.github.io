The movie is a <i>Succession</i>-core pope mystery with a wackier story than I expected, but all the men walking around in immaculate gowns being queens was certainly expected. The photography is the star of the movie. The rest is fine, even good in moments, but I'll forget the movie's contents soon enough.
