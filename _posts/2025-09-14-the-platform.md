In a kitchen, a man plays the violin as chefs prepare food, and two people watch fruit tumble down spiral slides. One, a man in a white suit, observes the careful preparation of each dish. Cut to Goreng awakening in a cell with a man named Trimagasi. They are on level 48, and this is The Pit. In the center of the room is a square hole that goes down and up multiple floors.

A platform moves from the top down, allowing each floor to eat what it wants for an allotted time before descending to another floor. Trimagasi discusses how the food they receive is what those above them dislike. Each month, they are assigned a new floor. Trimagasi used to be on 132, where inmates were forced to eat other inmates due to the lack of food reaching them.

And so on, you get it, yadda yadda yadda capitalism. It's <i><a href="https://boxd.it/5VnJXV" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cube</a></i> meets <i>Snowpiercer</i>, but even <i>Snowpiercer</i> had a complete idea. This film is a thin metaphor stretched out to 1.5 hours. The direction the story takes is so disappointing.

The gore gets quite visceral in places.

Whoa, Atonia San Juan makes an appearance! I've only seen her in <i><a href="https://boxd.it/9ncq8X" target="_blank" rel="noopener">All About My Mother</a></i>, and she was tremendous in that.

The filmmaking is competent, the performances are solid, but I never found an in that allowed me to enjoy what was happening.

Extra points for boy butt and dong.
