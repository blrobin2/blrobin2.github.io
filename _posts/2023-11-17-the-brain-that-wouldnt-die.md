New opening for Mike! It feels... weird. This is the in-between time where they haven't figured out Mike's deal yet

Even with a guy getting his arm ripped off, this movie is super boring

- It kind of looks like a Jenny Holzer piece
- You were right, the liver isn't in the skull
- But what does turning them into clowns prove, John?
- Tag, you're god
- The road is attacking me!
- Boss, your broke the goofy meter again
- Welcome to the Diane Arbus cafe
- Hey gang, there's a snuff film playing at the Rialto, let's go!
- Hi, I'm Casey Kasem! This one goes out to a heartsick lover with a severed head
- I wish my assistant hadn't had his arm ripped off, this would go a lot faster
- Oh I get it, it was a comedy
