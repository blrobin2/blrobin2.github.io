**Rating:** 4.5/5

At some point I realized that I had seen this before but I forgot most of the plot points

So many iconic shots! The one of him walking down the railroad tracks is one I’ll carry with me for a long time

Plot’s kind of weird: a dude with a kill switch he can’t control decides “eh, let’s love somebody, what’s the worst that could happen?”. One sequence in particular made me feel icky, and it’s rare for anything to do that to me, let alone a movie from the 30’s

If you love trains and hate people, you might just like this movie
