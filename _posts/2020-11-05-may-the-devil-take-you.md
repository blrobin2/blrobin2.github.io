This movie is fun... sometimes. It tries to have these character moments throughout without really building them off of anything. Like the main character misses her mom and spends a ton of time thinking about her, but it never coalesces with the plot or reveals anything, it’s just there. If you cut that out, you’ve still got 85-90 minutes of pretty outrageous horror
