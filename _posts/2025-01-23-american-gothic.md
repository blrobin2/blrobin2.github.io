<b><a href="https://boxd.it/rIGbC/detail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cult Movie Challenge 2024 | 43/52 | Slasher</a></b>

Cynthia and Jeff recently lost their baby. To help her recover, Jeff plans a trip to Puget Sound with some friends. But when their plane has trouble, they're forced to land on an unknown island. There, they meet Ma and Pa, who detest all forms of technology. They also meet Ma and Pa's kids, all who are at least 50 but think they're 12.

Our heroes insult Ma and Pa's way of life. Ma and Pa's kids dole out the punishment.

All the "kid" actors chew the sceneryâ€”Michael J. Pollard nails the tone. Rod Steiger gives the most grounded performance as Pa, which ends up working for the character. Sarah Torgov, who plays Cynthia, has the most to do, dealing with the traumatic death of her baby.

I had a hard time being invested in the movie when it was diet <i>Texas Chainsaw Massacre</i>. I enjoyed it more when it ventured towards <i>Midsommar</i>. If it got there sooner, I'd probably like this more.
