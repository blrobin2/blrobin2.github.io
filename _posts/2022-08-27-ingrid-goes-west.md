**Rating:** 2/5

Take away the “what if phones but too much” frame around the “single white female” riff, and there is a core that I find relatable when I’m at my lowest: that life is incredibly lonely and the desire to be seen and loved can easily override the desire to be myself, especially when I don’t particularly like myself. Unfortunately, this movie is too driven by cruelty and cynicism to do much with that concept
