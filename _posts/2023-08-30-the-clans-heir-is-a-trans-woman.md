The Tatsumi clan's leader is dead, and they must try to find his successor. They find her in a local trans bar, learning that she has transitioned when her father kicked her out 15 years ago

Meanwhile, the Honjou family is trying to buy out the trans bar where Nana and her friends work, taking any means necessary

Written, directed by, and starring Hitoshi Ozawa — a cis man — the language used and how characters are gendered is far from perfect, but the story is supportive of the trans community

What's the Bechtel test for several named trans characters who talk about something other than trauma?

Overall, it's not a great movie, but its heart is in the right place
