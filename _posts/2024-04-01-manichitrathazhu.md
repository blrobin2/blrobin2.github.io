<i>A note before my review</i>
I am unfamiliar with Indian movies, so I don't know what is unusual in this movie. If I've misunderstood a facet of the story or misrepresented a cultural component, I apologize and welcome any feedback.

Nakulan and Ganga come to visit. They plan to stay at Madampalli for a few months. Thambi, Nakulan's uncle, warns him that a murdered woman haunts the place. Nakulan dismisses them as local superstition.

Ganga and Alli look for a room to store Ganga's books. They find a room locked with sacred threads. Thambi informs them that the room is restricted as it holds the spirits of people who died in the house. The spirits have murderous intentions.

Ganga doesn't believe the stories and thinks there are valuables in the room, so Alli forges a new key so she can open it. Sridevi tries to stop her, but it's too late â€” Ganga enters. Soon after, strange circumstances afflict the family

When they enter the forbidden room, the murdered woman sings songs that no one seems to hear. Characters also break out into songs every once in a while to recap or exposit.

The movie spends most of its time following Dr. Sunny, who believes Sridevi has a mental disability and should be locked up. He investigates the happenings in the house.

At its core, the movie feels like a psychological thriller, but it has romance, musical, horror, and comedy elements as well.

The movie's concept of mental illness is bizarre, but it's interesting to watch the film appeal to psychological solutions over supernatural ones.

The movie climaxes with a song and dance routine that includes convincing someone they're murdering another person.

I'm not giving this a rating because I have no idea what to give it. I'll watch more Indian horror and hopefully get a better idea of its conventions.
