**Rating:** 2.5/5

The most labored musical! Every scene drags and drags with painful attempts at banter—superb costumes, stunning sets, but awful songs.

Poor Rita Hayworth. She did her best with the material—this includes the sheer dresses that wouldn't have passed the censors at this screen resolution.

I like all the gay shit. Marrying two guys? Hell yeah
