<b>I’ve heard of H20, but Web 2.0?</b>

Laurie is in a mental health facility for a disassociative disorder. The guy she beheaded in <i>H20</i> was not Michael Meyers. Michael dressed as a paramedic and escaped, putting a paramedic with a crushed larynx in the body bag with his mask on.

Sure.

Spotting Michael outside, Laurie sets a trap on the roof and catches him. She tries to remove his mask to ensure she’s killing the right person, but he stabs her. She drops to her death.

A year later, six kids won a contest to be on a web show called Dangertainment. They have to stay the night in Michael’s childhood home to understand what led him to kill. What’s the worst that could happen?

Webcams, Yahoo chats, and SMS — welcome to the future.

Katee Sackhoff shows up just before her <i>Battlestar Galactica</i> gig. I wish she had a character in this.

Moustapha Akkad inserted a clause that prevented Michael from being killed off. Jamie Lee Curtis negotiated to have <i>H20</i> at least appear as though Michael died and that she dies as soon as possible in the sequel. She knew we could throw this one away.

<blockquote><i>Trick or treat, mother fucker</i></blockquote>
