God I’ll never get over Baltimore accents, they’re so good. Did John Waters invent smell-o-vision?

<b>Quotes that made me laugh (that I remembered to write down)</b>

- “This whole world stinks so get used to it!”
- “1-3-5-9, G-rated movies are totally fine”
- “Oh Francine, there might be a god, everything is so beautiful!”
- "Gee, Francine! You're the most drinkin'est gal I know!"
- “Let me kiss away your DTs honey”
