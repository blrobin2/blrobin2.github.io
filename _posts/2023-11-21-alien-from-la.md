**Rating:** 3/5

I saw Albert Pyun and Cannon Group, and I knew something great was entering my eyeballs.Â 

This episode isn't great, it's mostly them slobbering over Kathy Ireland or making fun of her voice. This movie is funny enough without their commentary.

* Ah Halloween in the spring time
* Look for Mr Gooddad
* I thought we were beyond thunderdome
* Its not really a bottomless pit, its a topless hole
* Men can't resist women who fly coach to Africa
