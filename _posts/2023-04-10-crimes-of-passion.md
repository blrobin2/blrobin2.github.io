**Rating:** 3/5

Kathleen Turner plays a dual life as a fashion designer and a sex worker, taking quaaludes and drinking J&B, looking for freedom or whatever

Anthony Perkins is a weirdo street preacher dishing out his violent form of personal salvation. There’s a world where he and Jeffrey Combs play psychotic brothers

Annie Potts plays the sexually repressed wife who lost her spark trying to keep the family together. Her character breaks my heart, she wants to figure out her marriage, but her husband — like all the other wackos — is obsessing over China Blue

John Laughlin is the husband who just wants to f u c k. A sock puppet could replace him, he’s doing nothing

This script is so goofy when it’s Kathleen Turner and Anthony Perkins — so many scenes are nothing but double entendres between sex and religion — and so melodramatic when it’s Annie Potts and John Laughlin

It wins some weird points, but this isn’t a great movie. I know there are at least five other versions of this on the cutting room floor, and maybe one of those is better

* Rick Wakeman?? I guess he did the soundtrack, but still weird seeing his face in a movie
* My friends cheering me on as I play a character named the Human Penis
* That Life Savers wrapping paper rules
