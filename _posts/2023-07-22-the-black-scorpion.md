- guys, get out of the way, that’s why you’re dying!
- And then tragedy struck: we ran out of stock footage
- Why does he need a pipe? Why doesn’t he just suck in some air?

- Even if they catch that thing, they’re gonna need a lemon the size of a Volvo to eat it
- I got $20 that says the scorpion wins this one

It’s a shame this movie is so boring because the stop motion scorpions look so good
