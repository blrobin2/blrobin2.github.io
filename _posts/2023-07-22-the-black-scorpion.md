**Rating:** 2.5/5

* guys, get out of the way, that’s why you’re dying!
* And then tragedy struck: we ran out of stock footage
* Why does he need a pipe? Why doesn’t he just suck in some air?
* Look at this, it says “Thou Shall Not Ki”, what do you think it means?
* Even if they catch that thing, they’re gonna need a lemon the size of a Volvo to eat it
* I got $20 that says the scorpion wins this one

It’s a shame this movie is so boring because the stop motion scorpions look so good
