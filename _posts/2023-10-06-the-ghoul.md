Mahmoud visits Sheikh Dragore to take back the Eternal Light. Dragore has sold it to Professor Morlant, a renowned Egyptologist (see “imperialist thief”), who is dying and believes that the Eternal Light will grant him eternal life. Morlant summons Laing, his servant,  to ensure his funeral follows the proper procedure so that Annubis will help him come back at the next full moon

Of course, everyone wants the Eternal Light for themselves, and his heirs want anything at all, so the hoard goes to his Egyptian-themed home and learns his secrets

Wouldn’t you know it? Dragore comes back to life and starts killing them one by one

The remastering on this looks so lovely — they preserved the film's high contrast and soft textures. The house set looks cool too

The plotting of this is so convoluted — I guess because the concept is so simple that it takes a bunch of people trying to take it to fill the time

The film isn’t exciting, but it has some fun moments
