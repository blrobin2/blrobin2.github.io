<blockquote><i>I've never loved anyone the way I've loved myself.</i></blockquote>

Rachael talks with the NAAAAA (North American Assessment and Advertising Agency), and they offer her $ 1,000 for her 4-month-old baby, as well as a job, wherein she gives up all her rights and allows them to clone her at their discretion. Given only 10 seconds to decide, she agrees.

Thirty-one years later, Rachael's baby, also named Rachael, is an adult woman who talks like a baby and who loves her AI best friend, Spigga. Posters of different iterations of Mommy, from 1.0 to 6.0, line her walls. Rachael worries that she is boring because she always gives Mommy a perfect score, but Spigga assures her she isn't. All the while, the score from Mulholland Dr. plays in the background — this won't be the last time the movie uses references to other movies.

Spigga pulls Rachael into an assessment, where she watches a Mommy 6.0 concert. Afterward, a board assesses her response to the performance. At night, she smears her vaginal secretions all over her Mommy body pillow and dolls. She obsesses over the idea of meeting Mommy one day and having Mommy's puffy lips. And, for the first time after 1000s of iterations, Rachael believes Mommy loves her back and wants to talk to her.

It starts fairly strong but ultimately sinks into 4chan humor, channeled through an ironic, detached disposition, then calls itself out as though that absolves it.

<blockquote><i>It's called being an edgelord, and it's the most honorable thing you can do with you life.</i></blockquote>

While it doesn't succeed at what it's setting out to do, it's a big swing of a movie that I find difficult to hate. I could see this film's target audience loving it.

I'm not going to look at a computer or phone ever again, starting…
