I went in knowing I probably won’t love this movie. I wanted to see if I could enjoy the “vibes” as they say

The plot is totally irrelevant, but it also isn’t as hard to follow as people make it out to be. I’m not saying it’s logically cohesive, but like <i>Inception</i>, it layers in just enough bullshit — okay, way too much bullshit— to follow along

John David Washington is unbelievably bad in this. He makes this a worse movie by being too flat in his performance and not selling the choreography for the fight scenes. Thankfully there are masks to hide some of his work, aka give it to a stunt person to perform

Robert Pattinson sells the concept much more effectively. He has the action movie swagger to make the stupidest stuff sound… OK, and never to appear like he’s too committed to the insanity around him

Overall, I didn’t love it, but I had fun eventually. Of course, it doesn’t make sense. “Don’t try to understand it. Feel it”

<b>**_ SPOILERS _**</b>
The movie becomes enjoyable in the last hour when we get to fold over what we’ve seen and essentially watch the protagonist sabotage his efforts. Yes, it ties itself up into knots, but by having a real objective for the protagonist, it’s an easier ride
