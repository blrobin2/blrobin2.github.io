Yorgos Lanthimos gives us his rendition of a Coen Brothers farce. The result is, at times, tedious, but it all comes together in the end.

The audience was <b>divided</b> at my showing. One couple laughed so much during the movie that someone else in the theater moaned, "Shut up!" It didn't change anything.

Also, an older married straight couple was sitting in front of me, and whenever something gross would happen, the wife would glance over at her husband with a "Why did you bring me to this?" look.
