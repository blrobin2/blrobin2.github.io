**Rating:** 3.5/5

When I first watched this movie, I was still very religious. And I still found it hilarious because it never criticized Christianity as a whole, just the rampant hypocrisy. And the script comes from someone with experience on the inside because the characterization is pretty accurate.

That said, the movie's promising start leads to a pretty formulaic arc with sparse jokes to get me through. I still enjoyed myself, but some of its glimmer has waned with time.

askjeeves.com-ing the word "gay."
