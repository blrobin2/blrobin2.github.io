**Rating:** 5/5

The movie opens in a village where men throw rocks at dogs and children torture bugs — violence begot — a place held in American imperialist grips for the oil in the land — a purgatory where people end up but do not have the means to get out

After a rupture at an oil field 100s of kilometers away — natives watch on as it engulfs their homeland in flames — the Americans need to get nitroglycerin there but do not want to risk their men. So, they hire from the stray men on the streets four men, two per truck. Only one needs to make it — the other is just a failsafe

This film has an incredible pace, expressive and snappy cinematography, and set piece after set piece of unrelenting tension that kept me locked in until the end

A dark piece of work but ultimately a hopeful one — it looks at the world as it is and asks if we can do better

One of the most heart-racing movie-watching experiences I can remember — what a movie!
