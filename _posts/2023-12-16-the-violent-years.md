**Rating:** 2/5

I genuinely love the opening credits — the gang members taking turns standing in front of the chalkboard, their names appearing beneath them. It's very sitcom-y

* Fake court will now begin
* Hi mom, can I have more of everything?
* Hello girls! Good luck with the hold-up!
* We gotta get this story out by... oh, next week is fine
* I drive everyone away with my affectionate, good-natured demeanor
* Pajamas, jazz, and communism — this is WILD
* She died as she lived — failing algebra
* Another right turn... those fiends!
* She's got a room on the 400th floor
