<blockquote><i>During the Great Gold Rush of Alaska, men in thousands came from all parts of the world. Many were ignorant of the hardships before them, the intense cold, the lack of food — and a journey through regions of ice and snow was a problem that awaited them.</i></blockquote>

Dozens of men walk the Chilkoot Pass in Alaska, all seeking the same thing: gold. One lone prospector, Big Jim McKay, strikes gold far away from the others. Meanwhile, in the middle of nowhere, our intrepid Tramp makes his way along rock ledges, his backpack in tow. Scaling down a snowy embankment, the Tramp passes bears and buried bodies, narrowly avoiding trouble with the aid of his trusty hand-drawn compass.

A storm picks up, and the Tramp makes his way to a cabin occupied by Black Larsen, a wanted criminal, and his dog. The Tramp, unaware of Black Larsen's status with the law, fights the man for a place to stay. Joining them is Big Jim, who overpowers Larsen, forcing them into a truce. Through many days of raging storms, the hungry men work to survive.

Finally, Black Larsen sets out to find food, leaving Big Jim and The Tramp alone. Black Larsen also finds Big Jim's claim. How will the Tramp get out of this one?

I watched the original silent 1925 version or at least the closest approximation Kevin Brownlow and David Gill could create from assorted sources since the original print is still lost.

The shoe gag is an all-timer — same with the Tramp turning into a giant chicken. I feel like Looney Tunes modeled several characters after Big Jim. But all the memorable gags are in the first third of the movie. After that, things get less enjoyable.

This movie came out around the time that Chaplin got Lita Grey, then 15 years old, pregnant and married her to avoid a statutory rape charge. He had an affair with costar Georgia Hale that instigated Grey's divorce from Chaplin. He was such a messy bitch who lived for drama.

I know this is one of the great American silent comedies. As I've said in countless other reviews, I don't get much out of Chaplin's schtick. I like the movie—I found the New Year's scene affecting. But this is the third time I've tried to watch it because of how much of a slog it becomes. Homework done.
