**Rating:** 3/5

I like a lot about this movie: the land just absorbing these people, the blasé cult leader, faces in the trees, blood in the soil…

But it wasn’t well-acted, and the ending kind of goes off the deep end and not in an exciting way

The special effects are bad, but they’re pretty fun sometimes, but again, they go overboard, and it kind of becomes a mess

Still, good, bad vibes
