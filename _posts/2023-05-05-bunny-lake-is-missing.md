**Rating:** 4/5

Excellent opening credits with the paper tear revealing the title and credits — of course, it’s Saul Bass

Like Maris to Niles Crane, Bunny is spoken of but not seen. We know she’s in the First Day room, left in the care of someone cooking in the kitchen

A Karen’s validation, the school is full of inept teachers and supervisors who need the mother to take the initiative in finding her. And when she speaks to the manager, the manager is on her side!

But yeah, that kid is gone. Or…

A frenetic camera chases the characters around, zooming in wildly on faces and objects

The movie spends an awfully long time moving through the initial minutiae of the investigation, but all the details seem to matter as things take, well, unexpected turns

What an upsetting movie, what a pleasant surprise 

<b>Stray Thoughts</b>
* Weirdo landlords must have small pets. Jesus, that dude sucks
* Hell yeah, Zombies on the television
* Doll Hospital. What a nightmare
* I did not recognize Laurence Olivier without his little mustache!
