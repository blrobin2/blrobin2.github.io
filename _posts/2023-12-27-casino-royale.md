<b>Stray Thoughts</b>
* The poor goat :(
* Bond bathed by a 17-year-old
* Is everyone wearing toupees as a dig on Connery?
* Okay, a Peter Sellers and Ursula Andress scene is sort of funny
* A metric ton of upsetting race and little person humor
* Ursula Andress proves how underutilized she was in Dr. No.
* Jean Paul Bellmondo?!
* I like the clapping seal
