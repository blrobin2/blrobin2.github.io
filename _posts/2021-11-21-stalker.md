It’s been about 10 years since I watched this. It’s one of the first challenging movies I had watched; I didn’t know movies could be like this

At the time, I dwelt on the misery, the idea that nothing can make you happy, not even your innermost desires

This time, I felt the longing for faith, the need for something bigger than ourselves, however unknowable. For Tarkovsky, I think he sees this as the role of art (especially music). The sadness of the movie is not that life has no meaning, but that so many people believe it has no meaning, never giving themselves the opportunity to find one for themselves
