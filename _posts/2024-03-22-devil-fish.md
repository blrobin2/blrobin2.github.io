**Rating:** 1.5/5

Wild seeing a Lamberto Bava movie on <i>MST3K</i>. Alas, not everything he did was the caliber of <i>Demons</i> or <i>Macabre</i>. It would be easy to blame budget — Lamberto and Mario had their share of crippled funding — but even with a convincing monster, this movie wouldn't have much.

* I'm pleased at things
* — Still gets to you, doesn't she? — Yes, she's a very sexy radio
* — I haven't seen anything like this — Me neither. You?
* If you're so smart, why don't you speak English or play the drums?
* Here you go, this will make your coat shiny.
* That's Euro-funny
* The computer says it's 40 feet. Lucky bastard.
