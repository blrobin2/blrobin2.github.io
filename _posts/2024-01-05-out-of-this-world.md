I used some clips from this for a project in college. No, you can't see it.

- Movie bad! Movie go away!
- Try new enriched Stuff!
- I've never sat on local bread before!
- Beer Wine. Wine made from fresh beer
- But why does the strip club need bread?
- I have only one rule I follow: kill or be killed
- It's gonna turn out the bread truck driver is Jesus
