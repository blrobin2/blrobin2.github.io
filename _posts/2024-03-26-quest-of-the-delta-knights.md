**Rating:** /5

Season 9 finale! It's all going by so quickly :(

This is a perfect example of the type of 90s movie that I have no idea how to rate. Like, is this bad? It seems fine to me. And the Wishbone-style film stock makes it seem better. This is bad, isn't it?

David Warner is such a professional. He knew exactly what he was getting into. Warner loved making this movie and loved the MST3K episode about it. He offered to play multiple roles to save on budget.

Pearl takes Mike's place for the first part of the episode. Mary Jo Pehl has been a writer on the show since day one, so it doesn't change the tone that much.

* Je m'appelle bite me
* Back now, this is a lot of money
* It seems chilly in here â€” can you turn down your guy?
* Does that mean God the Father or Steve the Father?
* Let's tap that spigot on your head and have some cider
* David Warner, you are under arrest by order of David Warner
* Let's lead him to water and see what happens
