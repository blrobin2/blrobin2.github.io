I've been revisiting the past decade in music, trying to catch all the music I didn't the first time around, as well as revisit some old favorites. When I finish with each year, I'll post a list of my personal favorite 10 from that year. I encourage you to listen to any you haven't, as well as tell me what you think, what should be on here that isn't, what is on here that shouldn't be, etc.

- 10: The Wrens - Meadowlands
- 9: White Stripes - Elephant
- 8: Dizzee Rascal - Boy in Da Corner
- 7: Jay-Z - The Black Album
- 6: The Decemberists - Her Majesty
- 5: Broken Social Scene - You Forget It in People
- 4: OutKast - Speakerboxx/The Love Below
- 3: Sufjan Stevens - Michigan
