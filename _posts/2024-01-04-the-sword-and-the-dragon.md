**Rating:** 3.5/5

Even the writers admit this movie is alright, they just found the plot confusing. Maybe if Roger Corman didn't chop it up it might make more sense?

The film is the first Soviet widescreen film. They used over 100 thousand extras and 11 thousand horses! The war scenes look unbelievable and the dragons look sick as hell.

* When one sword tries to get along with an incorrigible dragon
* I bowled last night and I'm pretty stiff
* Hold on, I'm having a montage
* This is the best-tasting sword ever
* It's a good crop of stumps
* Don't let him in the palace, not with his shoes on.
* Is my face as weird as it feels?
* A collie is keeping them in terror?
* You shall become a noble or a prince or something
