**Rating:** 4/5

“Blood of Christ. Demon. A spell on him.”

Purif puts together a spell to bind Antonio to her, the day before his wedding to another woman. The village knows something is up with her, but after an eruption on the wedding day, they take steps to help Purif, or to get rid of her

Part of what makes this work so well is that nothing supernatural is ever seen onscreen, only the shared belief that this woman is a witch. In this way, it is a historical document and a true reflection of regional beliefs and practices

“You said it, so I guess it must be true”

The scene with everyone confessing their sins to each other — like letting their son die of hunger or lusting after their teenage daughter — to make Purif feel safe in confessing her cavorting with demons is wild. Like all that is cool, but taking to Satan? Get the hell out of here

Great ending! Great early folk horror entry
