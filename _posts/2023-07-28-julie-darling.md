**Rating:** 3.5/5

Julie (Isabelle Mejias) hates her mom and loves her dad — perhaps (no, definitely) too much. Mom has a guy take away Julie's pet snake —the guy tries to rape Mom and accidentally kills her. Julie witnesses the event and is elated that she now has Dad all to herself

That is until Dad marries his mistress, making her Julie's new step-mom. The step-mom movies in with them, along with her son. Furious, Julie concocts a plan to have Dad all to herself, but her step-mom might see more than she lets on

Isabelle Mejias is surprisingly good in this, and her performance propels forward what might otherwise be a "just okay" movie

The script is tight and considered — it takes a little time to get going, but once it does, its a tense and compelling story that makes unexpected but meaningful choices

Overall, this movie wouldn't win any awards, but for genre shlock, it stands out

<b>Stray Thoughts</b>
* Tommy Shaw has a crush on Julie. The guy from Styx?
* Julie walking in on dad and step-mom having sex and fantasizing about herself in stepmom's place is deeply upsetting
