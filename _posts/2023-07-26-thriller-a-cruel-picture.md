**Rating:** /5

Madeleine (Christina Lindberg) was sexually assaulted as a child, leaving her psychosomatically mute

As a young woman, she lives a quiet life at home until Tony (Heinz Hopf) picks her up, gets her addicted to heroin, and forces her into prostitution

When she refuses to sleep with a patron, Tony takes one of her eyes with a scalpel, making her an eccentric option for the more demented clientele

Of course, she will get her revenge, but not before training in martial arts, weapons, and driving

Do you want your gunshots to seem more realistic? Use live ammunition. Do you want your rape scenes to stick in the viewer's mind? Film actual penetrative sex. Do you want the eye-stabbing scene to have more impact? Stab an actual eye (in this case, a cadaver's)

This movie fulfills much of the pulp promised by exploitation â€” rape, revenge, shoot-outs, duels, car chases with a hilarious number of explosions, and slow-motion for days so that each bullet, each kick to face, has full impact

That said, this isn't a very exciting movie to watch. Despite all the pieces being there, the filmmaking can't quite come together into something with impact

What does stand out is the iconic Christina Linberg with her eye patch, leather jacket, and sawn-off shotgun, mowing down baddies

I have no idea how to rate this. I'll have to think about it
