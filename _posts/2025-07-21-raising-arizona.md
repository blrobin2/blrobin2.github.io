**Rating:** 4/5

* I'd also fall in love with Ed
* He tried to stay straight but it was "hard with Reagan in office."
* "Ye ate sand?"
* Banjo Ode to Joy = best Ode to Joy
* Her womb is "a rocky land where seed cannot find purchase."
* Nic Cage and I make the same faces at babies
* "I love him so much!"
* "Don't print that — if his mama read that she'd lose all hope."
* "I don't know, they're jammies — they got Yodas and shit on them!"
* "I loooove to drive." "You said something right there."
