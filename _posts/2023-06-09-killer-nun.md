**Rating:** 2.5/5

A nun receives brain surgery to remove a tumor — “cut away the evil,” as her mother says — and her life grows irreparably dark and painful — headaches, blackouts, and she can’t control her anger. Only heroin helps the pain, but she gets lost in a haze. Soon, murders happen all around her, and all the clues point to her

The movie has a couple of wild moments — and one cringe-inducing face torture scene — but the film gets convoluted in its plot points before one big reveal, leaving everything else where it is

Not a bad movie, just not one I’d go out of my way to recommend. If you’re looking for wild nunsploitation, you have better options
