TV's son of TV's Frank admitted this movie is fun. Hey Joel McHale

The Georges Méliès opening rules!

- And... I'm dead
- Polly wanna kill you!
- This is the line for Dr. Dog
- I always get squid and octopus mixed up — which one lives in a cave?
- You're not gonna believe this, but I'm the protagonist
- Doug, stop, there's a man in there! That's his blood!
- He died as he lived, falling down a ravine on fire
