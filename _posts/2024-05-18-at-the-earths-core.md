**Rating:** 2.5/5

TV's son of TV's Frank admitted this movie is fun. Hey Joel McHale

The Georges Méliès opening rules!

* And... I'm dead
* Polly wanna kill you!
* This is the line for Dr. Dog
* I always get squid and octopus mixed up — which one lives in a cave?
* You're not gonna believe this, but I'm the protagonist 
* Doug, stop, there's a man in there! That's his blood!
* He died as he lived, falling down a ravine on fire
