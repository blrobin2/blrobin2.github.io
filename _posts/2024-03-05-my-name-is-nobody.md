<i>CW // Murder, Racism, Ableism, Misogyny </i>

Three men ride into town as the church bells ring. The men enter a barbershop where a father and son work. They stuff the son's mouth with soap and the father's full of shaving cream.

Jack Beauregard (Henry Fonda) is on his way to Europe, ready to retire in peace. He goes to the barbershop for a shave. The man who lathers him up is one of the men who rode in on horseback — the other two watch from outside.

The man in the barbershop tests the razor's sharpness before bringing it to Jack's face. Jack points a gun at the man to ensure he doesn't do anything funny. The men outside ready their pistols. While Jack cleans his face, one man shoots through the window. Before they can do anything, Jack draws his gun and disposes of the men.

Once Jack leaves, the barber's son asks if there's anybody faster than Jack

<blockquote><i>Faster than him? Nobody.</i></blockquote>In a lake, a man kills a cricket and puts it on the water. He then grabs a large branch, waiting for a fish to come for the cricket. Jack rides by and sees the man bring the stick down into the water and come up with a fish in his hands.

Later, one of the dozens of men trying to kill Jack finds the man and makes him a deal — bring a basket to Jack and get a horse in return. The man brings the basket to Jack, revealing that he knows of Jack's feats. He tells Jack about his plan to take on all 150 members of The Wild Bunch and how he wants Jack to join in. Jack asks for his name.

<blockquote><i>Who, me? Nobody!</i></blockquote>

I love the delightful Morricone score. It enhances the sense of playfulness at the heart of the movie.

Is Terrence Hill funny or just handsome? Regardless, Nobody is a goofy character and makes me laugh.

That's what is most impressive about this movie — a 70s Italian import whose sense of humor still translates. It's not a laugh riot,

Henry Fonda's straight-man routine is a little too flat for me.

John Landis doing the stunts/set pieces makes sense — the physical humor sometimes reminds me of Animal House.

The end is a bit of a cop-out, putting most of the action in stills and montage, but it fits.

While this has its flaws, its warm-hearted style is rare in Westerns.

#### Stray Thoughts / Spoilers

- A grave with the name Sam Peckinpah, the director of <i>The Wild Bunch</i>
- Wild West Wagner
- Like stealing an apple from a baby?
- The letter at the end is way too long!
- Freeze frame on Nobody sticking his finger in a barber's butt.
