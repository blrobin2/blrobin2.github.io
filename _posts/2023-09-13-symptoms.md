**Rating:** 3/5

Anne goes out to stay at a countryside mansion at the invitation of her friend, Helen. Helen, once unassuming, reverts to a childlike state in the house, desperate to impress and afraid to be alone. Not only that, she begins to hear and see things in the place â€” we do too, but does Anne?

Helen shows an interest in Anne that goes acknowledged but unreciprocated. Anne's boyfriend wants her to come back home, but Anne recognizes Helen's loneliness and wants to give her a bit more time

Critics often compared this to <i>Repulsion</i> in that it deals with a woman seeming to lose her mind in her home. I would say it is closer to Robert Altman's <i>Images</i> but still of its own bent

Angela Pleasance (daughter of Donald Pleasance) gives a subdued performance. Her unconventional appearance feeds into the childishness she conveys, as well as the turn her character takes

I didn't love this, but I did enjoy the brooding tone and unreliability of what we see and experience. It may also be that this was a pain to track down, and that effort did not feel rewarded. Still, I think it's better than Larraz's better-known <i>Vampyres</i>
