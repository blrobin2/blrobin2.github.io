<blockquote><i>If I were you, I'd get your head examined</i></blockquote>While Jane is off having an affair, her daughter Lucy drowns her little brother in the bathtub. When Jane hears, her lover Fred and she drive to the house. On the way, they get in a car wreck that decapitates Fred, leaving Jane alive but also revealing the affair to her husband

A blind man named Robert owns the flat that Jane rents for her affair. Robert carries a flame for her â€” though she isn't interested, she still toys with him, bathing in front of him and flirting

After a year in a mental ward, Jane gets out and decides to move into the flat while she mourns Fred, making a shrine to him. Robert can hear her at night moaning Fred's name as though still in the throws of passion. In her freezer, she keeps a drawer locked that she regularly checks

You can probably guess where this is heading

The setup is solid, and the movie tries to prolong the inevitable by frequenting Robert's perspective. Perhaps the 80s audience was slower on the draw, but the journey to Robert's realization is a bit of a slog

Still, unlike the giallo that inspired it, the film does not spiral into a trillion twists, letting the facts and dramatic irony play out, and the final minutes are all the better for it

Lucy has a Southern accent for no apparent reason. She's the most gaslighting-est girl I've ever met, and her actions seem unmotivated beyond "she's crazy." I initially thought the actress was the same as the lead in <i>Sleepaway Camp</i>

Not great, but a solid first effort from Lamberto Bava
