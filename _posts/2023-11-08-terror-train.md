**Rating:** 3/5

<b>Med students are flush with limbs and cadavers</b>

<blockquote><i>Damn medical students.</i></blockquote>

Some med students prank Kenny, making him think he is getting in bed with a woman, but in fact, slips in bed with a post-autopsy cadaver.

Three years later, the group of college graduates have a party on a train, complete costumes, a live band, and a magician (portrayed by David Copperfield).

Ed, the class clown, came dressed as off-brand Groucho Marx, annoying everyone in his perimeter with puns. Just out of view, somebody runs Ed through with a sword, leaving him on the tracks and taking his costume.

The train festivities kick off well. One of the train conductors, though, finds a blood-streaked sleeper bathroom and a dead body in a lizard costume on the floor.

<blockquote><i>He's dead, all right. I've never seen anyone so dead as that.</i></blockquote>

I initially mistook Ed for Kenny, but I figured it out when they discussed Kenny's challenges in medical school.

The kids cheer for the train arriving in a very Francis Bourgeois way.

Overall, this is a goofy little slasher with a faint impression on me. Jamie Lee Curtis is a superb scream queen, and David Copperfield is hilarious in his brooding. I get why folks who grew up with this love it. I still enjoyed the experience.
