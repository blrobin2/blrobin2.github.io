<b><a href="https://boxd.it/pOmcY/detail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hooptober 9.0</a> | 28/34 | Film with a real life musician or band</b>

Jack wakes up, old scars down his back. He opens a drawer with old cash to pay his rent.

He attends church and then makes a mysterious purchase. Back home, he puts it in his otherwise empty fridge.

Some men break-in, but he immediately overpowers them. They shoot him in the hand and break his nose, but they're more inconvenience than injuries.

He learns of a daughter who wants to reconnect with him. At a diner, she sees someone he thought only he could see.

Someone kidnaps his daughter. He thinks he doesn't care, but then he does.

He gets into a fight, ripping someone's neck out. He eats whatever he pulls out, sending him spiraling.

Henry Rollins plays more straight-edge than in real life. If you enjoy people asking Henry Rollins endless questions, only for him to respond with "I don't know," this is the film for you.

It has some jokes. It's a somewhat unique take on its subject. I enjoyed watching it, but I wouldn't watch it again.

#### Spoilers

He finds Andrea early on â€” he hears her crying through the walls. He leaves in search of her but returns to the same place. It's lazy and inconsistent.

I like that he's Cain. They don't do enough with it.
