**Rating:** 2.5/5

They keep making references to jokes from the original show, and it makes me sad :(

Cowboys and dinosaurs is a fun idea and I can't believe it took until this movie for someone to try out the idea. The blend of live action and claymation isn't too bad!

* Rope for sale! Ice cold rope!
* Each rock is precious. It's the cowboy code
* More like Coyote Clumsy
* Trust her! She's your enemy's fianc√©e!
