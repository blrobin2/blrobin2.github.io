They keep making references to jokes from the original show, and it makes me sad :(

Cowboys and dinosaurs is a fun idea and I can't believe it took until this movie for someone to try out the idea. The blend of live action and claymation isn't too bad!

- Rope for sale! Ice cold rope!
- Each rock is precious. It's the cowboy code
- More like Coyote Clumsy
- Trust her! She's your enemy's fianc√©e!
