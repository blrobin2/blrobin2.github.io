Joe and Willy ride a boat through the swamp. Someone (or something) is stealing fish from their traps.

An anthropology professor (director Joy N. Houck Jr.) explains the Fouke Monster. He discusses theories about the monster being a mutated bear or ape. According to him, nobody has reported any human attacks.

Back at the boat, furry arms reach up from the water and pull Willy underwater.

Rives and Pahoo, two of the professor's students, want permission to go south. They intend to prove the monster exists.

They go looking for Joe to get his story. The sheriff warns them against looking into it.

People fear ridicule and looking foolish. Rives and Pahoo claim that isn't their goal but they regularly lie to and manipulate folks to get out of them.

They finally encounter the monster after sleeping in a family's barn.

But then they meet some redheads and spend a fair chunk of the movie trying to seal the deal with them.

It's got a couple of okay scenes, and the third act is strong, but this movie is more interested in its flat main characters than the monster itself.

It's fun seeing a young (er) Dennis Fimple. Otherwise, this is a slow, dry monster flick.
