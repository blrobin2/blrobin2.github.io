Hellboy is one of the few comic series I read all — or the majority — of. So, I’ve been a little nervous about coming to the adaptations

The one time Del Toro and Rob Perlman’s long-standing relationship pays off; Perlman is about as good a Hellboy as you’re ever going to get

The CGI monster fights are boring — as good as the CGI is for 2004, there are still too many lighting and texture issues to make them as immersive as the rest of the movie

It’s hard to tell if the fight scenes are slow or if this was just the pace of fight scenes then

I appreciate how they try to bring you up to speed on the lore, but it’s still pretty hamfisted especially the Liz plotline

As much as I like Hellboy, there’s no personality to this, and the script is terrible. Of course, I’m still going to watch Hellboy 2

Stray Thoughts

- Funniest use of the song Red Right Hand in a movie?
- Having to rescue a crate of kittens during a monster fight is pretty funny
