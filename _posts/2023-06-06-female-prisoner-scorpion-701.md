Two women attempt a breakout from a prison in broad daylight. For the attempt, the inmates all suffer the abuses of the prison guards

Flashback to a woman in love who does a sting operation for him and gets caught — first by the target, then by her lover who has set her up. She tries to kill him, but the police pull her off and arrest her

The movie becomes about her survival and her planning to escape and get revenge

Great use of color to heighten emotional moments. The camera is manic, zooming, spinning, and bending around the scenes — a glass fight in the communal shower grows surreal as the room glows blue, the woman’s face contorts, and her hair flies up to convey the malice

It’s still a women-in-prison exploitation movie — tons of nudity, violence, and lesbian sex — but that doesn’t limit its ambitions
