**Rating:** 2/5

This episode aired during Super Bowl XXIII. Interesting that they chose this movie instead of the later <i>Superdome</i>, which is about a Super Bowl.

The movie is two episodes of <i>Space 1999</i> glued together. It's so silly, but I love how it looks! Is this the youngest I've seen Martin Landau?

* What's a Wadsworth? Oh, about two and a quarter.
* Kids love the rich taste of titanium
* Nice blazer, Martin
* That's gotta hurt
* Don't shoot to kill â€” shoot to annoy
