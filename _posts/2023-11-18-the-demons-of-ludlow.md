Sybil lounges around in red high heels and a white lacy camisole. Chris comes home and chastises her for having a glass of wine. She lazily looks through some clothes on the bed.

We cut to the town of Ludlow's bicentennial celebration — a barn burner complete with bluegrass music and business casual attire. The mayor unveils a gift — a white harmonium with gold trim. It belonged to Ephraim Ludlow, their founder, and will sit in the town hall for everyone to marvel at.

Debra cuts in to tell the viewer about Ludlow's decaying history.

A house belonging to the Brubaker house, rundown and abandoned after a series of accidents, took out the entire family. The last member of the family committed suicide.

As Paul leads the town in prayer, Debra surveys bowed heads with judgment. Someone plays the piano, inexplicably producing harpsichord music and strings. Everyone looks bored as hell, save the mayor. They don't notice the keyboard dripping blood.

Andy and Eleanore sneak out to the barn with an oil lamp so they can fuck on wet hay laid out to dry. The door bangs and Andy climbs down to check it out. Eleanore strips off her clothes in the meantime.

A green-glowing claw emerges from the hay, tearing into Eleanore's stomach. Andy tries to run back. A flintlock pistol goes off, shooting him in the back.

The town, the next day, speculated that they had left together.

Paul and the mayor know something. They know Ludlow's history, but they dare not speak it. There is a curse on Ludlow. This is the Ludlow family's revenge for chasing them out of town. It's tied to the piano.

This movie is delightfully cuckoo.

Though it builds slowly, its effects are unexpected and surreal. The finale is one I'll be recounting to friends for a while.

This is Bill Rebane's <i>The Shining</i>.
