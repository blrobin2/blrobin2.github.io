**Rating:** 3.5/5

The template for the majority of psychological horror movies — especially those in which dreams/visions invade someone’s reality — lies in this film (not that it invented anything, just that it exemplifies that formula)

We get the prototypical haunted child who is the only voice that gives credence to what was thought illusory

We also get the fear of a social change — here, women’s lib and lesbianism — conveyed through the fear of the wife that she doesn’t actually love her husband or want to be with him anymore. Camilla is that fear made manifest, that latent desire to kill her husband and end it all

Cool movie! It has a bit of a lull before the third act, but nothing heinous

<b>Stray Thoughts</b>
* Showing up in red to a wedding is such a faux pas
* Oh hey, it’s dark Nathan Fielder! I initially saw Simon Andreu in The Forbidden Photos of a Lady Above Suspicion


<b>*** SPOILERS***</b>
Towards the end, some imagery evokes the husband as the state trying to shut down a rebellion — the way the girl in the red shirt puts her head down, hands outstretched, as he shoots her in the back of the head. Maybe talking out of my ass, though
