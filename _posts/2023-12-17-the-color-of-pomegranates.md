<b><a href="https://boxd.it/pXW6q/detail" title="Criterion Challenge 2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Criterion Challenge 2023</a> | 45/52 | 1960s</b><blockquote><i>This film is not the story of a poet's life. Instead, the filmmaker has attempted to recreate the world of a poet — the modulation of his soul, his passions, and his torments — broadly utilizing the symbolism and allegories of medieval Armenian troubadours.</i></blockquote>
On paper, this is a biopic about poet and troubadour (ashug) Sayat-Nova. In design, it is a series of moving, living paintings.

The color of pomegranate bleeding from the sheathe of a knife. A foot crushing a cluster of grapes. A child in child's pose, framed in stained glass, as a woman drapes blankets over them.

The child is our protagonist. The compositions are stages of his life reconstituted from the Armenian culture of the period.

<blockquote><i>I am the man whose life and soul are torment.</i></blockquote>Lines of poetry and song pair with the images. Not a narrative but another avenue into the poet's internal world.

Sofiko Chiaureli is a Tilda Swinton-type — their androgynous look transcends gender and readily imitates and elides it according to the scene's needs.

<blockquote><i>I desired a shroud for the dead body. Instead, they bared the frenzied contortions of their living bodies. Where then shall I seek selfless love?</i></blockquote>Director Sergei Parajanov's provocation is to ignore social realism in conveying a person who lived. Like <i>Andrei Rublev</i>, its poetic vision did not align with the rigid framework of Stalin. It was Tarkovsky's <i>Ivan's Childhood</i> that inspired Parajanov to make films in the first place.

This film could be the most beautiful-looking I've seen. I would love to play a video game in which each of the levels/worlds were these tableaux.

<blockquote><i>We're seeking ourselves in each other.</i></blockquote>
