### <a name="intro"></a>Introduction / Basic Setup

Recently, I was hired by a company that writes in Perl primarily, and does so on
Windows machines locally. As I am primarily a Linux user these days, I was
worried about getting a setup that not only worked, but would continue to work
when I asked it for more down the road.

If you look in most places, they'll tell you to install
[Strawberry Perl](http://strawberryperl.com/) or
[Active Perl](http://www.activestate.com/activeperl). Now, if you are primarily
a Windows user, and don't mind their command line, I highly recommend one of
these choices and be done with it (I had better luck with Strawberry). It'll
cover a lot of ground for you and get you started up quickly.
[Heres a basic article that will cover the details you need to know](http://learn.perl.org/installing/windows.html)

But you see, I do mind the Windows command line. I understand that it plus
Powershell are a powerful combination in the right hands. My hands are not those
hands. I like feeling like I'm in a Linux environment, delusions be damned.

For that, the most popular choice will be [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/). I've
played with it and others, and for our purposes, it will get the job done.

That said, here's the absolute basics for getting set up (finally, right?).

### <a name="cygwin"></a>Installing Cygwin and Perl

1. Go to the [Cygwin](https://cygwin.com/install.html) website and download the
   appropriate version for your operating system type. If you are unsure,
   [here's some instructions to find out](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/32-bit-and-64-bit-windows#1TC=windows-7).
2. Open the downloaded .exe file. On the first screen you'll see this sentence:
   "This setup program is used for the initial installation of Cygwin environment
   as well as all subsequenct updates. Make sure you remember where you saved it."
   That means you'll be keeping this file after you run the install, because this
   is how you'll get new packages and get updates for Cygwin. It's a little
   unconventional, but because Cygwin doesn't actually install a "program" as
   Windows understands it, Windows doesn't know how to help it. It's all good, it
   just means you should stick this file somewhere where you won't accidentally
   remove it. Understanding this, you can close, move the file and start again, or
   just move on by clicking "Next >".

3. In "Choose A Download Source", your best bet is just to "Install from
   Internet" and carry on. Without going into too much detail, you're looking at
   more configuration with the other choices, and unless you plan on doing installs
   without an Internet connection, just choose the first and click "Next >".
   ![Choose a Download Source](/img/cygwin02.png)

4. In "Select Root Install Directory", the default install folder is in the
   `C:\cygwin` directory (or `C:\cygwin64` if you're installing the 64-bit version
   as I am). Click "Next >".
   ![Select Root Install Directory](/img/cygwin03.png)

5. In "Select a Local Package Directory", you will select where all of your
   packages will live. Like the installer, these are files you will keep, so be
   sure to select a place that you don't mind keeping them. For me, the Downloads
   folder was fine. Click "Next >".

6. In "Select Your Internet Connection", you're most likely going to use
   "Direct Connection", unless you know that you need one of the others. Click "Next >".
   ![Select Your Internet Connection](/img/cygwin04.png)

7. In "Select a Download Site", you have an insane list of mirrors. This is a good
   thing, because if one doesn't work for you, you have plenty of options. At one
   point I chose "ftp://cygwin.mirrors.pair.com", and I've never had a problem
   downloading anything. This is the one place where trial and error may come into
   play, howevever, I doubt you'll have much trouble.
   ![Select a Download Site](/img/cygwin05.png)

8. The next screen will attempt to download the package information from the
   mirror you selected. Depending on connectivity and availability, this can take
   a few seconds to a couple of minutes. Just let it run until you see the next
   screen.

9. In "Select Packages", you will be installing Perl. In the search bar in the
   top, search for "Perl". From the results look for the "Perl" folder. Next to it,
   and every other folder, you will see a cycle icon and the word "Default" next to
   it. For the "Perl" folder, click that cycle icon until it says "Install" next to
   it. This will download every package Cygwin has for Perl. This may seem like
   overkill, but like I said, I want my setup to work for the foreseeable future. A
   quick note: I know this may be obvious, but you will also see other things selected
   for Install by Cygwin. By default, Cygwin installs some basic packages. Don't
   change their status! Just because you don't think you'll need it doesn't mean
   that you won't need it later. Better safe than sorry.

10. STILL IN "Select Packages", clear the search for "Perl" and type "make". If
    you're familiar with Perl, you'll know that you can install packages to extend
    the language through the [CPAN](http://www.cpan.org/). Without going into too
    much detail, CPAN requires "make" in order build the packages and use them in
    your projects. Once you search "make", open the "Devel" folder, and go down to
    "make". Click the cycle icon until it says "Install" next to it (note that the
    screenshot says "Keep" because I already have it). NOW, click "Next >".

11. Cygwin will now download everything it needs to get set up. Since this is
    probably your first time runnning everything, this can take awhile. So grab a
    coffee, read up on Cygwin if you're feeling diligent, or ponder the universe
    if you're feeling existential.

12. Once it's done, you'll have the option to create a shortcut. Do it, so you
    can find it again.

13. Open Cygwin. You'll be presented with a Linux-style command line, and you
    will be in a `home` directory that Cygwin created for you. In fact, if you look
    in the cygwin folder, you will see some folders that look an aweful lot like
    the directory structure of a Unix system. If you want to just be in your C folder,
    you can type `cd cygdrive/c/` and you'll be there. Some people don't mind this,
    some would rather their Windows home directory be their Cygwin home directory.
    Under "Advanced Configuration", I link to an article that provides steps on how
    to set that up. Personallly, I like the directory structure and tend to keep it
    as my default.

14. To verify that Perl was installed correctly, type `perl -v`, and you should
    see something similar to the screenshot below. Don't worry about how different
    my terminal looks, but the command and the resulting text. It's okay if you
    have a different version, but it should be pretty similar.

15. You're done!

### <a name="cpanminus"></a> Cpanminus

If you stopped now, you would be in good shape, and ready to go. But if you want
to download packages from CPAN, you may run into something asking you to configure
it. If you know what you're doing, go for it. I, however, had no idea, and
stumbled around awhile before I was able to get things installing how I wanted.
To save you some pain, I'm going to recommend a package called [Cpanminus](http://search.cpan.org/~miyagawa/App-cpanminus-1.7040/lib/App/cpanminus.pm). It's basically the same thing as CPAN,
but it doesn't require configuration and provides a simply output to make
debugging much simpler. Any differences between the two won't matter unless you
need a specific configuration, but that would mean that someone has decided
that configuration, and that person should be helping you, not me.

To install, all you need to do is open Cygwin and run `cpan App::cpanminus`.
CPAN will run through a number of checks, tests, and build the package for you.
Because we installed `make`, this should run without any issues.

To verify it works, let's download a sample package. Let's do [Try::Tiny](http://search.cpan.org/~ether/Try-Tiny-0.24/lib/Try/Tiny.pm). This will be almost exactly the same as installing Cpanminus,
except instead of using the `cpan` command, we use the `cpanm` command. This
will let Cpanminus install the package for us. So run `cpanm Try::Tiny`, and
let it run. As it goes, you'll see OK's as each thing successfully downloads.
When it's done, it will let you know how many distributions it's installed.

### <a name="advanced"></a>Advanced Configuration

There are tons of articles out there on configuring
Cygwin to your liking, and a simple Google search will find what you're looking
for. As I like [zsh](http://ohmyz.sh/), I followed several steps from
[this article](https://www.4thinker.com/cygwin-setup.html) and changed my
Cygwin Terminal executable to execute the following:
`C:\cygwin64\bin\mintty.exe -i /Cygwin-Terminal.ico /bin/zsh --login`. I pasted
this in "Target". This will make Cygwin login to zsh every time it starts up.
It's not perfect, but it gets the job done, and I will gladly hear out
improvements. Cygwin by default uses [mintty](https://code.google.com/p/mintty/)
as it's terminal emulator, and it works just fine for my purposes, so that's
what is getting executed to get things started.

If you're unfamiliar with zsh and want to give it a shot,
[Wes Bos has a tremendous series of videos](http://commandlinepoweruser.com/) on
getting started.

I expect that for someone reading, some of this reads like a foreign language,
and the prospect of changing defaults is intimidating. I understand! I've been
there, and I don't think you should have to do a lot of extra configuration
unless you really want to. But once you get confortable with Cygwin, you might
find yourself willing to try new things.

This is all you need to get to developing Perl on Windows, with a dash of Cygwin
config because I wish I had it all in one place when I got started. There are
many ways to go about this, but this is the way that has worked for me. I hope
all of this helps!
