Simone Signoret is such a striking presence onscreen — especially with those sunglasses on — it’s hard to believe she works in a boarding school, but life happens to everyone

The tears going down Véra Clouzot‘s face as she is forced to swallow her food… She does a great job at being frail in that “actually sick” kind of way without appearing weak — she doesn’t want to fight but she will when her hand is forced

Paul Meurisse pours his coffee and cream at the same time… is that a game-changer or a hassle?

The tension doesn’t let up! I think I’m going to have a heart issue after this

I love that at the very end of the movie is a card telling people not to “be a devil” and spoil the movie for anyone
