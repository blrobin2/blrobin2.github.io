**Rating:** 3/5

Teenage melodrama slice of life, where love and friendship are quite literally life or death

There are always going to be anime tropes and stylistic choices that keep me from loving it, but this stays grounded in the way it portrays bullying and the relationship between regret and isolation

A sentimental and cozy Sunday watch
