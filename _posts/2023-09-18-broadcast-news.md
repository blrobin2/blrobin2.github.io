Tom grew up afraid that being good-looking and dumb wouldn't get him anywhere. Aaron knew he was smarter than everyone else and thought that was the ticket to getting everything he wanted. From childhood, Jane gave herself self-imposed deadlines, keeping herself too busy to worry

<blockquote><i>what can you do with yourself if all you can do is look good?</i></blockquote>As adults, Jane and Aaron are best friends who also work together on a national TV network — Jane is Liz Lemon: an intense producer whose work defines her life and who has never been wrong about anything (according to her) — Aaron is Pete Horberger: a clever and talented writer who lacks the social skills to get any higher at work

<blockquote><i>Ok, I'll meet you at the place near the thing where we went that time</i></blockquote>The two share a disdain for the sensationalist direction news is heading. Tom — think Drew Baird (Jon Hamm), but blonde — shows up as a green news anchor and begs for Jane to help him improve

<blockquote><i>except for socially, you're my role model</i></blockquote>Their chemistry is dynamite, and they produce what they consider convincing television, which leads to the two falling for each other (in their own way). Meanwhile, Aaron is discovering his feelings for Jane, and their relationship suffers as a result

<blockquote><i>— it must be nice to always believe you know better — to always think you're the smartest person in the room
— no ifs awful</i></blockquote>The film deals with TV news but has a decidedly unmotivated political bent — diet neolib, if you will. But in part, that's because this movie is about these
three people, and how their work defines their relationships to other people. Every moment has the possibility of a breaking story, and they have to pick up where they are

<blockquote><i>Sorry... sex, tears... this must be the news</i></blockquote>So it makes sense that the characters are looking to the people they work with as potential partners — who else are they meeting? And it also makes sense that they don't know each other outside of their roles at work — there's a difference between a producer yelling at an anchor and a lover's spat (I've never said "lover's spat" in my life, but I couldn't help myself)

When the film is at its best, it focuses on the real-time production and airing of a news program. Experts/episodes of <i>30 Rock</i> have taught me that the intensity and breakneck pacing is accurate. The film, however, flails a bit when it tries to work out the characters, although it hides it behind plot, arguments, and a sweeping romantic score

But here's the core they start and never give its due: when the world quiets down and Jane has nothing to work on, she cries. Now, maybe it's supposed to be a humorous thing for her character. But to me, it reads like Jane needs something to change in her life

Still, I found this to be charming, funny, and engaging. Holly Hunter is a gift, and she and William Hurt have legit chemistry that had me twirling my fan like a Southern belle. Albert Brooks is pretty funny and perfect as the nerd who feels entitled to other people's attention

A tremendous movie, and a huge influence on things I love, so it's hard not to love it back

#### Stray Thoughts

- I'm happy to see Joan Cusack — I wish she got to do more in this
- Sorkin wanted Hurt to play Jeff Daniels' part in <i>The Newsroom</i>, I'm sure of it
- <i>Great News!</i> is another show that this movie had to inspire
- Jack Nicholson gets just enough screen time to show how shallow and cruel he is
