I remember being in art school and finding obsessions. There’s always a fear of being perceived as naive or undereducated about a subject since “it’s all been done before” or whatever. But when you can just let yourself go and lose that fear a bit, it can feel vital and freeing, like I don’t have to think about what I’m going to make for a bit, it’s just going to focus on this

Anyway, I feel like this short captured that feeling pretty perfectly
