This episode was the first where they did a post-credits stinger. The older man yelling, "Help me!" was so weird to the writers that they had to include it one more time.

Franks says he watched this movie six timesâ€”I hope that was only him and the writers didn't have to endure that.

This movie came out during the Hollywood blacklist if you're wondering how such a terribly dull film got made. Not that all boring movies require such an excuse.
