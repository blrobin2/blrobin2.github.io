**Rating:** 0.5/5

* Ed Wood agonized over this scene, and now we are
* I'm learning a lot about porn!
* I'm not gonna pay a lot for this muffler
* I used to make good movies, like Bikini Carwash
* The Ford Industry seems laid back and inviting!
* This smut was placed here by the Gideons
* Pow! Right in the sinister urge
