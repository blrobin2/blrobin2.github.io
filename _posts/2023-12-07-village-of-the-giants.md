Classic Bert I. Gordon fodder â€” conventionally-sized stuff gets big: cats, ducks, dogs, teens.

- Somehow this movie is a metaphor for the Vietnam War
- Oh no she's tonguing the universe
- Honey, I shrunk the Opie
- The Beau Brummel Bridges of Madison County
- It's fun to kill things!
- Very, very white collar crime
- Uh, it's stuff that I'm happy about!
- This is David Duke's dream
- Alright Sheriff, we've given it a lot of thought and we decided to step on you
- I inhabit a nightmarish universe of my own making
