**Rating:** 2/5

Classic Bert I. Gordon fodder — conventionally-sized stuff gets big: cats, ducks, dogs, teens.

* Somehow this movie is a metaphor for the Vietnam War
* Oh no she's tonguing the universe 
* Honey, I shrunk the Opie
* The Beau Brummel Bridges of Madison County
* It's fun to kill things!
* Very, very white collar crime
* Uh, it's stuff that I'm happy about!
* This is David Duke's dream 
* Alright Sheriff, we've given it a lot of thought and we decided to step on you
* I inhabit a nightmarish universe of my own making
