“Corn rigs are bonny!” That’s not leaving my head anytime soon

Being a “fan” of the Nic Cage version, I figured I owed the original a chance. Why didn’t you tell me it was good??

I’m glad the island is modern as opposed to the Amish-like folks in the newer version. It makes the more unusual elements stand out

Music seems constant, and it fluctuates between diegetic and non-diegetic. It’s hypnotic

The officer comes across a slo-mo make-out party in the yard. He’s a Catholic and engaged to be married, so he is… tempted? Dude is way too tense and repressed. I can see why they’d choose a Nic Cage for a role like this

This is the most carefree I’ve seen Christopher Lee in anything. He’s usually a villain or solving a mystery

Of course, May Day is when shit pops off. Masks, a bread representation of John Barleycorn, conspiracy to murder, kilts…

I don’t think I’ve ever seen a movie quite like this one, a welcome surprise, and a tense, outstanding experience
