**Rating:** 4.5/5

I love watching this and knowing how it ends because the filmmakers structured everything so deliberately that I never feel like any bit is out of place. The filmmaking has a timeless quality that only falters in a couple of digital SFX choices. But the main reason I return to this movie is the Gothic, <i>Turn of the Screw</i>-adjacent dread and atmosphere.
