In <i>Ossos</i>, Pedro Costa created a fictional story in the Fontainhas district of Lisbon. Vanda Duarte was one of the principal cast members.

In this movie, Costa abandons the crew and film cameras to create a narrative from the lives of Lisbon residents.

Armed with a single digital camera, Costa centers Vanda Duarte and her heroin addiction. Meanwhile, the city demolishes Fontainhas around them, displacing the inhabitants deeper into the margins.

The story is fictional, but the people and places are real. The characters speak a rehearsed script, but the narrative comes from authentic experiences.

This film is one you could sit around and philosophize about. Just see it, thatâ€™s all.
