Death and injury plague a technically advanced health club. The owner tries to find out who (or what) is the cause. The owner's wife committed suicide a year before, and he believes her spirit has something to do with it

The special effects look pretty good, with several creative and over-the-top applications, but there were a couple of instances where I couldn't tell what was supposed to be happening. My favorite is when the paranormal investigator tries to shoot a possible ghost, and his hand explodes

The only major issue I had with the movie was William Bumiller's performance — he could not be less bothered by the insane things around him. There's a plot twist that could have a problematic reading, but I didn't see it that way

I was soft on the movie until the third act, where it goes all out with the kills and effects

Overall, I had a fun time with this one! One to watch with friends

#### Stray Thoughts

- "I'm Betamax. You're VHS" — nice archaic diss
- Always happy to see Ken Foree — his high-five with the owner is so funny
- Hilary Banks?!
- I love the neon sign for the spa — it looks so wacky
- I recall listening to the <i>How Did This Get Made?</i> episode about the movie, but I don't remember any details from it
- "My lawyer has the cutest shorts I've ever seen."
- The "(nagging music)" caption is a new one for me
- The song in the closing credits is hilarious
