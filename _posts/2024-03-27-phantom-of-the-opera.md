In the move into sound pictures, Universal lost confidence in the phantom's ability to scare the way the other Universal Monsters, or indeed, the 1923 Phantom, had.

The phantom's role in the plot is minimal. They turned the film into a musical and emphasized the lavish atmosphere. The Technicolor looks gorgeous, highlighting the rich colors of the costumes and set. The cinematography is fluid and uses the space incredibly. While the songs are pretty dull, the singing is striking. Universal reused the Op√©ra Garnier replica made for the 1923 film because it's incredible.

This turn influenced Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical, overtaking the public's perspective on what <i>The Phantom of the Opera</i> is.

If you can accept the movie on its terms, it's pleasant.
