**Rating:** 2/5

Is this really the first Jayne Mansfield movie I'm watching? Her husband isn't very good at this whole acting thing.

I like the hydra! It sucks! They say "Achilles" accurately too!

* A Greco Romantic film
* My father is dead to me. It's a long story.
* ðŸŽµ I miss my dead wife!
* It's like a Thomas Kincaide painting: horrible!
* Attacking from the side is too safe. I'll attack them in the front where their mouths are!
* I got bumped by a hydra, now I have inner ear problems
