While driving one night, Robert finds Elysabeth walking out in the rain. He picks her up and learns she's running from something. Within minutes, she's forgotten why she's in the car in the first place

Without her memories, Robert becomes her whole world, and she has sex with him. But it doesn't take long after he leaves for the memory to fade — At least for the moment

The movie explores the slow decay of time, the endless present — life without memory, leaving you fragile and unable to move through the world. In some way, it might be too successful, as the first half of the movie seems to drag on

As the movie progresses, we learn more about the why of the memory loss and that there are others like her, but the film devolves into long monologues to explain everything, leaving an uneven experience

I like a lot about this movie when I think about it, but the experience of watching is pretty okay
