<b>Oh no, <i>Succession</i> ruined Matthew Macfadyen.</b>

Elizabeth Bennet walks across a sun-soaked field, reading the last page of a beloved book. Passing through the moat, she weaves through linens hung out to dry and past the door of Longbourn, the Bennet's estate. Inside, Mary plays the piano. Jane carries her needlework as Lydia and Kitty run by chasing one another.

Mr. and Mrs. Bennet discuss the letting of Netherfield Park by the wealthy bachelor, Charles Bingley. The Bennet sisters gather outside the door, swooning at the prospect of their father marrying off one of them to Mr. Bingley. Mr. Bennet will allow Mr. Bingley to choose at the assembly ball the following day.

At the ball, Elizabeth shares with Jane her belief that all men are "humorless poppycocks," while Jane assures her they're not all bad.

<blockquote><i>One of these days, Lizzie, someone will catch your eye, and then you'll have to watch your tongue.</i></blockquote>The ball quiets as Mr. Bingley, his sister Caroline, and the furrow-browed Mr. Darcy enter. Mr. Darcy glances at Elizabeth before turning away. Elizabeth pauses before letting out a quiet laugh. Straight away, Mr. Bingley and Jane take to each other. Elizabeth tries to dance with Mr. Darcy, but he shrugs her off. Later, she overhears Mr. Darcy complaining about Elizabeth's looks. Mrs. Bennett confirms how plain Elizabeth is.

And so begins the story of, among other things, the romance between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy.

Fans of Jane Austen's novel will find plenty to complain about. For one, Bennet's turn from landed gentry to country folk unfamiliar with custom undoes much of the meticulous nature of the book.

The filmmakers trade Austen's sense of humor and wit for a more swooning and Romantic-with-a-capital-R expressiveness. And, at nearly a third the length of the beloved 1995 miniseries, it was impossible to include the depth of character and subtle changes that the miniseries possessed.

If you accept the changes, the film is a joyful and warm journey. The energy is teen movie adjacent, dealing with people who are too dumb to understand their feelings. The romance between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy will always make me feel a little icky â€” the "you think you hate them, but you actually love them" schtick isn't my bag.

Still, the movie has a beautiful style and cinematography. Joe Wright will always prioritize that over a story, as <i>Atonement</i> can attest.

It also has a delightful sense of humor, although quite mean-spirited.

God, I hate Mr. Collins.

Overall, I completely understand why people love this movie. While I don't love it, it's a stunning image with moving performances.

Donald Sutherland brought me to tears.
