This sequel has little connection to the original, except for the main character. The first provides additional backstory, but it isn't necessary to understand the movie.

While this movie still features elements of the original Gothic style in certain aspects, it is not as dominant throughout. 

This movie has more of a Western, post-apocalyptic vibe.

The improved animation style is right in my comfort zone. This came out while I started watching anime. The monster details are reminiscent of Tales from the Crypt comics.

Also, they lean more into D being permanently stoic, even when he's fighting, which is an anime trope I'm so tired of.

They go to the baron's castle in the last 30 minutes. It is bananas. Everything descends into bizarre dream logic, drawing on the inner desires and traumas of those who walk through the castle. If the movie played out entirely in that brooding style, I would love this movie.

The movie introduces bounty hunters and puts a price on vampire's heads. The bounty hunters are boring, and they get so much screen time. I'd prefer this be a short with the third act over any scenes with them.

I laughed every time the bounty hunters called for Kyle. A noble, illustrious name.
