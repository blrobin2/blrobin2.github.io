“Let’s not have a complete double duck fit”

Lon Chaney finds a lot of nuances in this role and gives a memorable performance, totally unexpected. Also, I’m glad he was game for all the Wolf Man references

Quinn Redeker is pretty funny in this, he takes absolutely everything in good faith

I wonder if the spider scene in <i>The Beyond </i>is an homage to this?
