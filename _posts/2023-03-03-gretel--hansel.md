**Rating:** 3.5/5

A24-core visual style — beautiful frames, intentional and expressive coloring, triangles and more triangles — and that emphasis on atmosphere over story

If you care about knowing exactly what is happening at all times, this will frustrate you. If you liked <i>The Green Knight</i>, you will at least appreciate this
