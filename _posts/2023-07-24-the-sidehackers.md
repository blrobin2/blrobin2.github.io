**Rating:** 1/5

This is the episode where Dr Forester and TV’s Frank coin the term “good bad movie”

* Easy rider, easy DEAD
* Help, I’m sidehacking and I can’t get up!
* It’s a lock! You know, little fish, on bagels?
* I like everybody… I even like Gallegher for crying out loud
* You know, there’s a ton of change in this mattress
* Why didn’t you say tires, we love tires!
* Yep, more dead people. Funny, huh?
* I guess there’s not gonna be any more side hacking. Maybe… sidehack coffin? Side coffin?
