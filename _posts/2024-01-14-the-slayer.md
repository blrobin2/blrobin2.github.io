<b><a href="">Cult Movie Challenge 2016 | 6/52 | Video Nasties</a></b>

Kay has a recurring nightmare where something is chasing her. Something inhuman.

Kay and her husband, David, pick up Kay's brother, Eric, and Eric's wife, Brooke, to go on an island vacation. They take a plane to the island.

They expected a sunny trip, but the island was overcast and windy. During summer, the island is replete with tourists. Now, only four remain.

This place seems familiar to Kay. The pilot interjects:

<blockquote><i>You ain't the first to say that, and you won't be the last. People have dreams about places like this.</i></blockquote>

They find a rundown, abandoned theater. It looks exactly like a place Kay has painted before. Kay's painting has transitioned to surrealism, pulling images from her dreams.

The pilot warns of an incoming storm, offering them a chance to leave. They decide to take their chances.

An oar blow to the head results in the fisherman's murder. Kay startles awake.

The high-level concept is very similar to Stephen King's book, Duma Key, in that an artist manifests what they paint. This, however, is far more interesting.

From a slasher perspective, this movie falls short. While the special effects for the kills are top-notch, they offer nothing new.

Because of the subjective, open-ended structure of the narrative, however, the film has multiple interpretations. Using dream logic, premonitions, and self-referential scenes leaves you wondering if it happened or who did what.

This can be problematic, as the author's intention remains unclear. But this ambiguity keeps me thinking about the movie.

They spend time arguing over Kay's dreams, but they get out of the loop before it becomes unbearable.

This movie will only appeal to slasher enthusiasts. While it isn't a great movie, it is fascinating.

<b>**_ Thoughts / Spoilers _**</b>

- Something happens for every character in the first act that foreshadows their death.
- Kay killed her cat as a kid — she blamed her nightmares then.
- Eric meets a horrifying fate as he is dragged into the sea by a fishing line during the night.
- The pitchfork effect was pretty good! All the effects are solid in this.
- Maxwell House instant coffee — when literally anything will do.
- The skeleton creature is silly and creepy. It has classic "Tales from the Crypt" vibes.
- Was it all a dream? Or is this a flashback? She sees the cat and worries.
