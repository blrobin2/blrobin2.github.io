Joel's facial hair is awful. This is now the most high I've seen Joel

- I wonder what they're making butts out of this year?
- Check please!
- i hate these curtains man!
- no jail, no handcuffs, nuthin
- Ah, nothing like a moonlit afternoon
- At least they haven't broken any traffic laws
- Did you see Cop Rock last night? It sucked (just excited that someone referenced that show)
- You killed a tree, Banjo!
