\*\*\*\* grew up in Smallville. Her only outlet was UCB Live, particularly the hilarious Ra's al Ghul. But when she questioned her gender identity, her mother took her to Arkham Asylum, and Dr. Crane gave her a drug to make her appear happier.

Fifteen years later, after bombing a <i>UCB Live</i> audition, she invents anti-comedy and opens a club with her friend, Penguin. There, she meets Mr. J and finds love.

We follow her journey of finding her identity as Joker the Harlequin, as well as stopping Batman and Lorne Michaels.

The film (very) loosely follows the structure of Todd Phillip's <i>Joker</i>, skirting every copyright infringement it can in the process.

I am so happy I can see this in theaters! It was so up in the air since they pulled it at the Toronto Film Festival.

The Alamo opening was so unhinged â€” a Snickers commercial, data-moshed Ferris Bueller, a French YouTube video about Tim Burton's <i>Batman</i>, an interview with Vera Drew, and a fuck ton of Joel Schumacher-related content.

Vera Drew filmed the whole movie on a green screen and built a weird and specific world that I enjoyed spending 90 minutes in.

Trans women continue to reinvent art as we know it.
