Waco and his biker gang ride through the Arizona desert. At a tollbooth, the police suspect their bikes are hot. Waco catches on, and they speed away. A helicopter follows but does not intervene.

They pass a convent and a line of nuns getting on a bus. The police cut them off. With nowhere to go, they hide out in the convent.

While there, they find heroin stowed in their bikes. They didn't put it there — they suspect the helicopter was the smugglers from whom Waco bought the bikes, ensuring they crossed the border.

When the cops find them at the convent, Waco kidnaps a nun named Anna.

Now that Waco is onto the scheme and doesn't cross the border, the drug smugglers come after them as well.

Also, for some reason, Anna must make a choice — God or Waco.

If you love motorcycles more than pacing, acting, or coherence, you might enjoy this movie. The cinematography is pretty, especially the sunset hanging with everyone's big hair glowing in the setting sun.

I don't know! It's got decent vibes. It isn't good, but I wouldn't dismiss it entirely.

#### Stray Thoughts / Spoilers

- This movie isn't Christploitation. I think the poster throws people off. But, like, Anna denies God to be with Waco.
- A biker holds up peace signs as the helicopter shoots at them.
- That helicopter explosion looked not cheap.
- — Who knows how to cook a chicken? — Who needs to cook him?
- The crossfade of Anna screaming and the cross
