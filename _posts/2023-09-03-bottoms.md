An absurdist teen comedy about two queer friends starting an all-woman fight club to get laid

The sense of humor reminded me of <i>Not Another Teen Movie</i> — albeit with much more improvisation — as many of the jokes are playing off of expectations set in teen movies and television

The film's biggest weakness is how much it relies on improv. Several scenes fall into dead silence as the actors try to formulate a joke, and it is agonizing

The cringe-inducing awkwardness was likely intentional, but a few scenes felt like mirror copies of earlier ones because they were not tightly scripted

Still, the overall tone is hilarious, and the set pieces are at their best when coordinated to music — something the movie does three times, and it works every time. The montage with Avril Lavigne's <i>Complicated</i> is <i>_</i><i>chef's kiss_</i>

The only similarity this has with Emma Seligman's other movie, <i>Shiva Baby</i>, is Rachel Sennott being a lead. Otherwise, this could not be more tonally different

While this ultimately left me wanting, it is still one of the funniest movies to play in theaters in ages, and I'm all about that gay shit
