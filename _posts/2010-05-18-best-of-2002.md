I've been revisiting the past decade in music, trying to catch all the music I didn't the first time around, as well as revisit some old favorites. When I finish with each year, I'll post a list of my personal favorite 10 from that year. I encourage you to listen to any you haven't, as well as tell me what you think, what should be on here that isn't, what is on here that shouldn't be, etc.

- 10: Beck - Sea Change
- 9: The Notwist - Neon Golden
- 8: Black Dice - Beaches and Canyons
- 7: Sonic Youth - Murray Street
- 6: Wilco - Yankee Hotel Foxtrot
