#### Stray Thoughts/Spoilers

- The funniest Bond movie title by far
- Is that supposed to be Fidel Castro?
- Did they film all these opening credits silhouettes in one long trampoline/dancehall session?
- The clown chased by knife-welding twins is weird. He has a red balloon and a Faberge egg. And it's 009!
- Penelope Smallbone
- New M! I like him! He has the signature blend of scolding schoolteacher and amused coworker
- Vijay rules
- "Having problems keeping it up, Q?"
- Bond smashing the spider is gross
- "Hiss off," says Bond to the cutest little guy slithering over his legs
- The Tarzan call as Bond swings on vines — so lame
- Why does everyone say, "And you're James Bond — 007, licensed to kill"?
- Octopussy's henchwomen are dressed like Thing 1 and Thing 2
- Everyone is relishing the opportunity to freely say "pussy"
- Octopussy is her father's nickname for her??
- Sawblade yo-yo
- Bond in a gorilla costume??
- That train must be going 10, 15 mph!
- Clown Bond???
- Why would Magda be there if the bomb were going off in 90 seconds??
- Even after Bond disarms the bomb, she just shrugs!
- That stunt guy is on that plane! Woah!
