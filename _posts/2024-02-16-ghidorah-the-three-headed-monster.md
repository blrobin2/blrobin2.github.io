<b><a href="https://boxd.it/q7ygw/detail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cult Movie Challenge 2016 | 24/52 | Godzilla</a></b>

It's quiet at 2 AM in Tokyo. A heat wave in January â€” not just on Earth but throughout the galaxy. Scientists wait for a transmission to tell them what is wrong.

A Venusian rescues the Princess of Selgina from an assassination attempt so it can occupy her body and warn the earthlings of impending doom.

A giant meteor descends in the mountains. Surveyors camp to observe. They witness it grow, then crack open. From out of it comes King Ghidorah, wiggling about like a maniac.

Two tiny women from Mothra's Infant Island tell government officials that Mothra, Godzilla, and Rodan must join forces to stop Ghidorah.

This movie has a trillion subplots. It took me most of the movie to piece these essential plot points together. It's all interesting, but it's a lot to track.

The monsters "debating" each other is very funny. I'm glad the Infant Island twins were there to translate.

King Ghidorah looks sick as hell. It feels like all the monster budget went to him because Godzilla and Rodan look a little janky by comparison.

This might be the first time I've seen Takashi Shimura in color!

It might have helped if I had watched the movies between the first Godzilla and this one. I might do that now...
