Dream team collaborators Brian Yuzna and Stuart Gordon, as well as dream thruple participants Jeffrey Combs and Barbara Crampton, reunite for another HP Lovecraft adaptation

Jeffrey Combs plays a belligerent scientist mistaken for a schizophrenic man whose partner’s invention, The Resonator, increases the size of the pineal gland, allowing him to experience an alien creature, and in the process, accidentally killing his partner

Barbara Crampton is a psychiatrist who believes Combs after a CAT scan reveals that his pineal gland has, in fact, grown. She helps release Combs into her custody so that they can recreate the experiment together

We learn about pineal gland monitors sexual stimulation, so these horny kids get into some hijinks!

Good to know we’d all have leather kinks and be schizophrenic if our pineal glands were bigger

A wet, slimy adventure — signature Yuzna shit. Everyone goes all out, leaving taste at the door, and it’s all the better for it. Absolutely bonkers. I love it

- Nice “Don’t Tread on Me” flag with the alien worm on it. I guess it’s not an homage to noted racist HP Lovecraft without some far-right imagery
- Did Silence of the Lambs steal its psyche ward intro from this??
- He lives at 666 Benevolent Street. Nice
