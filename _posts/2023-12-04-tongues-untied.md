This film is a poetic documentary that breaks silence to proclaim stories of black men loving black men in the face of anti-queer, anti-black America.

With segments of poetry, rap, snap demonstrations, and personal stories, it explores the intersection and marginalization of blackness and queerness.

The racism of whiteness, queer and straight, that not only excludes but hypersexualizes black bodies.Â 

It talks of the homophobia that engenders unrelenting violence.

The trans body, the body in drag, fetishized and hidden away, questions of passing versus the ability to exist.

The segment about vogueing is like <i>Paris is Burning,</i> except t feels like a view from the inside rather than an outsider looking in.

The snap demonstration is so good!
