**Rating:** 2.5/5

TW: Suicide

One of the cruelest and most depressing episodes from a commentary perspective.

The movie is grim. We see the main character's dad hang himself.

* Is this a Warhol film?
* The Potsie story
* ... or anus. Any questions?
* Time to have better sex than you've had in your life, sir
* Is beer booze?
* How's the German expressionist date going?
* She's guilty of thought crimes!
* My dad's gonna kill me and I'm not going to graduate because I'm dead because my dad killed me
* mmm, good reefer, man
* I get it, sex metaphor!
* I wish this movie had these guys in it
* Unfortunately, Marve will get caught when he turns in his timecard with these hours
