It starts with a violent crime by three criminals:

Billy Bob Thornton has no issue lighting someone on fire to get what he wants — a hothead with no inhibitions

Michael Beach is the one who is cool and collected as he stabs and kills the neighbors. He’s the only one holding this whole thing togethee

Cynda Williams has to kill a kid to cover their tracks, but cannot follow through

This is just the first ten minutes

This lame fucking blues kicks in, and the levity of everting is severely undercut — a recurring crime of 90s movies

Bill Paxton plays “simple” country sherif who has his own way of doing things, but his naïveté may get him in trouble

The movie moves slowly, and the pieces come together pretty early, so it’s mostly a matter of waiting for everything to go down

It’s a solid script, though, and the performances are all pretty good. You can tell it wants to be a Coen brothers movie, but it doesn’t have the cracking dialogue and tightness of even the Coen’s lesser crime films
