The kid is a fucking weirdo who does a good job of playing something between Oedipal and outright murderous: strong Babadook kid vibes

This movie has some great, outrageous ideas: the switchblade in between the piano keys, the floating diseased hand with the box cutter, the swing set voodoo that nearly crashed a plane, the kid running up to his mother and instantly transforming into his father... I could go on

There’s also a lot of dull moments, but they’re worth tolerating for the tense conclusion
