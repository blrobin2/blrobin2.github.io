“I’m only 18 years old and I’m totally doomed”

Kids in LA hook up and break up on the day the Earth ends, which happens to be the night of Jujyfruit’s epic party. An alien with a laser is abducting people, fights are breaking out, and kids are finding Jesus and killings themselves in dramatic fashion

The film feels like a step backward from <i>The Doom Generation</i>, hitting a tone that blends it and <i>Totally Fucked Up</i> — mostly through Duval’s videotape diary. The movie also moves more in vignette style like <i>TFU</i>

That said, this also set the formula for the teen movie house party that would be replicated for years after this. Not only that, this movie stars several of the stars of those movies before they broke out

No surprise the sets and costuming are great. It’s a beautiful movie to look at, both in terms of cinematography and in terms of how many hot people are in this

Strand Releasing is the one who did the 4K restorations for <i>TFU</i> and <i>TDG</i> and will put out a 4K of this later this year, releasing them on physical media all at once. Like the <i>TDG</i> restoration, it will include scenes cut for MPAA rating, so I wonder if the movie will feel more cohesive with those scenes

Overall, still, a lot to like here, and still a unique vision from Gregg Araki

#### Stray Thoughts

- Bikini Kill sticker on the window, hell yeah
- Pulling out nipple rings with pliers sounds… intense
- The Ataris were a bitching gang before they were a shitty pop punk band
- The can scene is brutal
- What an ending!
