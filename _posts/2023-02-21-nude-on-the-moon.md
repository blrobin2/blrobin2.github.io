**Rating:** /5

Amazed how committed this is to the sci-fi conceit — the rocket ship effects, the goofy space suits, 25 minutes of “plot” about how they got the money to do this and how smart they are

Can’t exactly recommend this, but it is a curious entry from “the most prolific woman director in the history of American cinema”
