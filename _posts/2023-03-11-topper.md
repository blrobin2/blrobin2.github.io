Wow I just realized that I smushed Jimmy Stewart and Cary Grant together in my head and thought they were the same person

Movie opens with Cary Grant driving a car with his feet, these folks were doomed from the start

Constance Bennett has Bugs Bunny energy — she hands someone a rope tied to her car like a leash and asks them to hold onto it for her

Roland Young has Fraiser Crane energy — put upon, but capable of comic performances in the right moment

When Topper is nearly passed out from being drunk and the Kerby’s invisibly carry him through the lobby — very funny, Roland Young sells it well

Anything that isn’t their ghost hijinks is kind of boring and dater, but there are a fair amount of gags

I enjoyed this more than I thought I would
