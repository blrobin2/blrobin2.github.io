<blockquote><i>You’ve got more natural talent when you dance than anybody I’ve ever seen</i></blockquote>I realized that I had only seen clips of this on TV and that I didn’t know much about this movie beyond its reputation. Now is as good a time as any to fix that

Nomi (Elizabeth Berkley) is a woman on the run from her past. She hitchhikes to Vegas and meets Molly (Gina Ravera), who brings her into the world of showgirls. Nomi works as a dancer at The Cheetah but aspires to do more. Thanks to Cristal (Gina Gershon) and he boy toy Zack (Kyle MacLachlan), she may get her wish and a whole lot more

Similar to <i>Starship Troopers</i>, this movie has achieved the ability to be whatever you want it to be: awesomely bad or underrated masterpiece, you’re still in for a singular and entertaining experience
