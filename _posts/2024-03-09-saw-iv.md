<b><a href="https://boxd.it/tG7x8">Saw: Ranked</a></b>

<i>CW // Blood, Viscera, Murder, Sexual Assault</i>

John Kramer is dead. His dick is out, and his neck is slit. They perform an autopsy, removing his brain and cutting open his chest. In his stomach, they find a cassette tape coated in wax.

Detective Hoffman comes to listen to the tape. It turns out that Jigsaw had more games set in motion.

We watch Jigsaw's silly traps and learn Amanda could not have been Jigsaw's only apprentice. It seems like it's one of the officers who is investigating the Jigsaw murders.

Whereas <i>Saw III</i> had a story that helped the audience get through it, this movie is a threadbare frame for traps. The revelation of the apprentice is obvious â€” it's like Scooby-Doo when you only introduce two new characters.

Good lord, this is gory. This is also the first movie to use digital blood splatters.

The movie has high production value and ridiculous set pieces, but this is boring as hell. That feels weird to say about a film with so many people shooting blood everywhere and losing limbs.

I laughed at, "I don't have a fuckin' soul!"
