<blockquote><i>Don't worry, Dave — all we want to do is kill you</i></blockquote>It's about clowns from space that kill people, believe it or not

Visually, this is a treat — the circus tent spaceship has several colorful designs and detailed matte paintings. The clown designs are peak late-80s aesthetic — I could imagine Klasky Csupo animating this

For gore fans, this will be disappointing — you could say the movie is a slasher for kids since the deaths are so goofy, but I don't have the best litmus for that sort of thing

Story and filmmaking, this gets groan-worthy at times, but by committing to the bit, it's fun to see what set piece they come up with next

<b>Stray Thoughts</b>

- As a small child, I was afraid of clowns. So I would see this at the video rental store as a kid and wonder about its deal, imagining something horrifying
- "Nobody stores cotton candy like this!"
      \* How is this making me want cotton candy? I don't like cotton candy!
- The comically inept cop saying he'd shoot all the kids if he could — "to hell with them all!" — the most realistic depiction of a cop
- I love that the popcorn kernels are baby klowns
- There has to be a darker ending somewhere
