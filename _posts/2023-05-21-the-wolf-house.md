**Rating:** 4/5

The framing story is that a German colony within Chile is trying to clear up misunderstandings about them, and the story told is to help that

The colony punishes a girl named Maria, so she runs off into the woods. Trying to escape a wolf, she finds and enters a house. The story is about her exploration of the space and its metamorphosis (and hers) throughout the film between two-dimensional drawings on the wall, papier-mâché, and real objects

It has a fairy tale essence with dark surrealism governing the world. Surreptitiously, the story functions as propaganda for the colony as Maria begins to regret leaving the colony after facing the consequences of staying in the house 

Beautiful animation — it reminds me of William Kentridge with the sort of “erased” trail of the movement

If you don’t know about Colonia Dignidad, look it up. Real fucked up stuff!

And at 75 minutes, how could you say no?
