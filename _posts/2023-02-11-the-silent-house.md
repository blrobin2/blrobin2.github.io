**Rating:** 2/5

Filmed as a one-shot — or at least cut together to look like one — keeps the tension sharp, but…

At a certain point “something” is revealed and the internal logic of the movie — or what little they had established — goes out the window

*** Spoilers ***
Apparently the sounds she hears upstairs at the beginning of the movie are the same sounds she makes later, and she has a dissociative episode or something, it’s a mess
