<blockquote><i>This cold war just got hot.</i></blockquote>Say what you will about the episodic story, nonsense time travel, and non-existent characterization — the movie has an artistic vision and production.

The costumes are PG versions of Schumacher's Batman. It's hard to see this as a coincidence with Akiva Goldsman being involved in both. It's nice that they gave Irwin Allen a writing credit since everything substantial in the movie came from his TV show.

Also, I see you, Christopher Nolan. <i>Interstellar</i> is NOT that dissimilar from this movie.

It's funny reading Roger Ebert's critique about the drab color palette — compared to the dark, gritty bullshit that's been churned out for the past 20 years, this movie is shimmering.

I had the posters for this movie and <i>Space Jam </i>on my wall as a kid. I can't give this an accurate rating. That said, it's no more routine or cliche than the new F4, so it feels unfair to give this movie a lower score than I gave it.
