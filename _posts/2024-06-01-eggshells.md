Tobe Hooper’s first film is a collection of scenes involving a hippie commune in Austin, Texas.

The film doesn’t have a strong narrative through-line. The individual scenes have a slice-of-life quality, capturing the dull hippie conversations — hauntings and sending out vibrations, the definition of communism, but mostly fucking. 

One guy, who never speaks, experiences weird shit in the house. He sees a paper airplane crash into the house and catches fire. He sword fights himself, flipping places when the sword comes in contact. He encounters something in the basement that emits smoke and light. It may or may not be influencing the house.

The whole thing has big “student film” vibes. It feels like a few ideas glued together — you can make them work, but that’s on you.
