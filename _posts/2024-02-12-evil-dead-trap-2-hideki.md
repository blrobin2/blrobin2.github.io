Aki is a film projectionist who fixates on dead bodies. Everywhere she goes, she sees the spirit of a child.

We learn that a killer is on the loose. Aki's friend, Emi, is a TV news reporter covering the murders — and is secretly turned on by them.

Emi introduces Aki to Kurahashi, a married man who wants to eat and fuck to forget his disturbed wife, who never got over their unborn son, Hideki.

We see Aki killing a woman, cutting her ovaries out of her body. But Aki doesn't remember it. And she may not be the only one.

The tone of this movie is entirely different than <i>Evil Dead Trap</i>. This movie goes for a surreal, dream logic where everything feels fractured and unreal.

For a good part of the movie, this works well and sets an uncomfortable mood. But when the film hits the third act, the tone inhibits its ability to find a way to an ending. As a result, the last 20-30 minutes are repetitive and exhausting.

Be warned — this movie is quite gory — a fair bit of cutting, dismemberment, and disemboweling.

I wanted to like this more! While I appreciate the unique tone, it didn't come together satisfyingly.
