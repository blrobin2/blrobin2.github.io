<blockquote><i>I don't know about you guys, but me — I've had it up to here.</i></blockquote>Nick meets with a secret vigilante group who protect their neighborhoods. The police protect no one. The members train with handguns.

One evening, a man with a knife kills a woman in the elevator. The police do their round but laugh it off. An older resident witnessed it and told the vigilante group. They take her through the city, where she spots the man. The vigilantes beat the men up and stuffed them in the back of their van.

Eddie lives an ideal life with his wife, Vickie, and his 8-year-old son, Scott. They plan a vacation to Florida. He works at a steel factory with Nick.

Vickie sees a punk pouring gasoline on an older man at the gas station. She begs the attendant to do something, but he only watches. So, Vickie pushes the punk off the man, threatening to call the police.

When she gets home, she sees the man and a few others parked outside her house. She calls the police, but they tell her they can't do anything. The men break in and kill Scott with a shotgun. The man she stopped beats her and stabs her, leaving her in critical condition.

Eddie tries to go through the judicial system, but the judge lets the man off. When Eddie begs for a trial, the judge gives him 30 days in prison for contempt of court. When he gets out, he takes matters into his own hands.

<blockquote><i>— You killed my son.
</i><i>— Fuck him.</i></blockquote>The soundtrack fucking rules. There are some sick synth jams, especially during the chase scenes.

The movie is wise with its violence. It's not fun, nor is it constant — it's brutal and shocking.

I love Robert Forrester — he's so good as the everyman, and it's easy to root for him, even when he does heinous things.

The ending is so good!
