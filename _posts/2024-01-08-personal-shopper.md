Maureen (Kristen Stewart) is a personal shopper and medium living in Paris. She hates her job but feels like she cannot move forward until she receives a sign from her brother, Lewis.

He was also a medium and recently died from a genetic heart condition that they both share. They agreed to communicate from the afterlife if one of them passed away.

Maureen spends a night here and there at Lewis' house.

As Maureen continues her work, she seeks to communicate with the spirit world.

One day, Maureen receives texts from an unknown sender. Is this Lewis? Or something else?

I wasn't aware of the supernatural aspect of this film, but I'm familiar with Assayas and his genre-defying style. The jarring tonal shifts and roundabout start were welcome.

Kristen Stewart performs incredibly, creating a complicated human with tics and obsessions. Assayas wrote the part for her so she fit perfectly.

I loved this! The cinematography was captivating. The story wound around and kept me engaged from start to finish. I initially thought the movie could have ended earlier, but the actual ending was perfect.

While I've enjoyed everything I've seen from Assayas, this has been my favorite.
