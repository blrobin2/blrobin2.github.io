The wagon for Professor Powers Original Mammoth Medicine Show rides along the coast. The professor died, leaving his daughter Mary in charge of the medicine show. She didn't want to continue, but "Flash" Farrell persuaded her to carry on, taking the helm. They enter the town of Hickoryville, looking for who might agree to let them run their medicine show in the city. A local tells him it would be Sherrif Jim Hickory, but he isn't one for medicine shows.

Sherrif Jim Hickory and his two brawny sons, Leo and Olin, are respected members of the Hickoryville community. Jim's youngest son, Harold, however, lacks their muscle. He makes up for it with his intuition for solving problems, but the family doesn't see it that way. Harold stays behind when Jim, Leo, and Olin leave for a town meeting regarding a new dam. For fun, Harold wears his father's badge and holster.

Flash rides up, believing Harold is the sheriff. He tricks Harold into signing the ordinance, and hijinks ensue.

I was initially worried about Harold's relocation from the city to the country. But Lloyd and his team packed the movie with clever gags and impressive stunts. The cinematography brilliantly supports the jokes. When Harold climbs a tree to say goodbye to Mary, the camera follows him up—the moment gave me such a big smile. And the boat setpiece in the third act is so well-utilized!

The story has several subplots to keep things interesting: a strongman who wants Mary, a Mary-Harold romance in which she thinks Harold is the sheriff, a rivalry between Harold and Hank Hooper, and the conflict over the town dam.

Everyone has their favorite between Keaton, Chaplin, and Lloyd. As much as I love Keaton and tolerate Chaplin, Lloyd remains my favorite. This film is a delightful experience I wish to revisit in the future.
