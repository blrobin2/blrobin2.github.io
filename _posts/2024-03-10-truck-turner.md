<blockquote><i>You don't know Truck Turner. He's like a bulldog with eyeballs up his ass.</i></blockquote>
Isaac Hayes's music plays over LA — the rich and the poor, the violent and the bystanders. Liquor shops, blood banks, and bail bonds lace the streets, ready to feed on anyone it can.

The phone rings in Truck Turner's apartment. His wall photos and trophies harken to his football days. Truck wakes up, gun strapped to his chest, and answers the phone. Jerry, his partner, is on the line — it's time to get to work. After his injury, Truck stopped playing professional football and took up bounty hunting to pay the bills.

Fogerty's got a job for Truck and Jerry — a pimp named Gator who jumped his $30K bail. Fogerty needs him alive, and Gator is dangerous. But they aren't the only ones after Gator — a rival pimp named Harvard Blue would love to take Gator's stable of women.

This movie was so much fun! The script has jokes and some of the most off-the-wall lines, especially from Yaphet Kotto. All the pimps at the funeral pouring out some coke on Gator's hand is so funny.

The car chase is tense — they fuck up some decent cars too!

Isaac Hayes's score has the perfect blend of funk and orchestral stings. His performance isn't outstanding, but he's having so much fun that it's hard to dislike.

Some of the stunts look painful — they throw people through real glass.

There's a scene with a hanged cat :( I don't think they hurt the cat, but it's still upsetting.

I'm happy to get a Scatman Crothers appearance. And once again, Dick Miller shows up, making this the fifth movie I've seen him in this year.

This movie is the prototype for the buddy cop movie. Shane Black owes a lot to this.

The movie loses some steam towards the end, but it never falls off, and the climax is a thrill.

What a treat!
