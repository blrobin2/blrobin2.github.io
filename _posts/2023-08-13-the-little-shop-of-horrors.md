Seymour saves his job by planting a strange seed, growing a carnivorous plant called Audrey Jr, after his coworker and crush Audrey

After discovering that the plant eats blood, he gives it as much of his own as he can manage. The plant grows and gets hungrier. So Seymour goes looking for bigger sources of blood

This movie is the original version on which they based the stage musical, on which they based the 80s Frank Oz version

Besides the songs — and Rick Moranis — the original has all the dark humor and farcical fun of the 80s version and more. And, if I'm being honest, I don't love the songs from the other version, so this one works better for me

Not all the humor has aged that well — not in a "poor taste" way necessarily, but with obscure references — but for the most part, the jokes translate

I'd love to see this get a remaster treatment — the version I saw was a little rough around the edges
