<b><a href="https://boxd.it/BQGCY/detail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oh My Horror 2025 | 35/52 | Anthology Horror</a></b>

I like my classic horror anthologies, but I've been avoiding this one for a while.

It turns out, when you give 26 directors carte blanche for your horror anthology, they will just insert as many fetishes as they can.

I usually go through each chapter and rate it. This one has 26 shorts, one for each letter of the alphabet. Oh god, here we go…

<b>A is for Apocalypse — Nacho Vigalondo \*</b>
A man is sitting in bed eating breakfast. A woman walks in with a kitchen knife and tries to kill him. When it doesn't work, she explains why she did it.

It's going for humor, but it doesn't work.

<b>B is for Bigfoot — Adrian Garcia Bogliano \*\*.5</b>
Xochitl finds her babysitters, Dulce and Erik, snogging on the couch. So, to get her to go to bed, they make up a story about the Abominable Snowman taking away children who stay up late.

No surprises, but the result is at least competent.

<b>C is for Cycle — Ernesto Diaz Espinoza \*.5</b>
Bruno finds a puddle of blood in his yard. At night, he hears a sound. In the morning, his wife is gone. Also, he finds a hole in the bushes.

For such a short film, you'd think they could logic out the order of operations, but it's nonsense.

<b>D is for Dogfight — Marcel Sarmiento \*.5</b>
A man enters an underground fighting ring and fights a dog.

Nonsense, but decent cinematography and over-the-top sound design. I know it's pretend, but I still don't want to see someone pretend to hit a dog.

<b>E is for Exterminate — Angela Bettis \*\*\*</b>
A man tries to kill a spider in his apartment. Meanwhile, he wakes up with more and more spider bites.

This is likely why I put this anthology on my list, because I wanted to see what Angela Bettis would do. It's silly, but it comes together nicely.

<b>F is for Fart — Noboru Iguchi \*\*.5</b>
Yoshie wishes she didn't have to be so ashamed whenever she farts. She's also obsessed with her teacher, Miss Yumi.

Softcore fart porn with a marginally higher-than-usual budget. I mean, the director is literally a fetish porn director. It's so brazen that I respect it.

<b>G is for Gravity — Andrew Traucki \*.5</b>
A surfer brings his board and a bag of bricks to the beach.

Beyond the novelty of the POV camera, this one doesn't do much.

<b>H is for Hydro-Electric Diffusion — Thomas Mailing \*\*.5</b>
It's World War II, but everyone's a furry.

It's porn, duh, but it's so unbelievably weird that I'm at least on board.

<b>I is for Ingrown — Jorge Michel Garu \*\*</b>
A man has his wife tied up in the bath, and he keeps injecting her with motor oil.

I appreciate how the short is trying to bring awareness to women's abuse, but it does so by portraying horrific abuse.

<b>J is for Jidai-geki — Yūdai Yamaguchi \*\*</b>
An executioner is preparing to decapitate a samurai, but the samurai keeps making weird faces. Like, really weird.

I liked some of the faces the samurai made.

<b>K is for Klutz — Anders Morgenthaler \*.5</b>
A woman takes a shit at a party, but it won't flush.

Yep, it's porn. It's animated, at least.

<b>L is for Libido — Timo Tjahjanto \*</b>
Two men are naked, strapped to chairs, and forced to masturbate to increasingly disturbing things.

It's porn. Not a big Tjahjanto fan.

<b>M is for Miscarriage — Ti West \*</b>
A woman attempts to unclog her toilet.

¯\_(ツ)\_/¯

<b>N is for Nuptials — Banjong Pisanthanakun \*.5</b>
Shane flirts with Ann via a parrot he just bought. But the parrot knows more than it lets on.

Good, uh, parrot performance?

<b>O is for Orgasm — Hélène Cattet and Bruno Forzani \*\*</b>
Two people have sex with surreal and violent imagery accompanying them.

Wait, the one called "O is for Orgasm" is pornography??

<b>P is for Pressure — Simon Rumley \*\*.5</b>
A sex worker cares for her three kids. She's getting by, but her kid's birthday is coming up. So, when her boyfriend steals her savings, she takes an unusual request.

Seems transgressive for its own sake. I like the director, and I like how this short is directed, but I hate the direction the narrative takes.

<b>Q is for Quack — Adam Wingard and Simon Barrett \*\*</b>
Directors Adam Wingard and Simon Barrett resent getting the letter Q.

Making it meta doesn't make it clever.

<b>R is for Removed — Srđan Spasojević \*</b>
A bandaged man repeatedly gets his skin cut off so they can use it as 35 mm film.

FUCK, I didn't know Srđan Spasojević was involved with this. I'm so pissed. Of course, this is disgusting to watch.

<b>S is for Speed — Jake West \*.5</b>
Roxanne kidnaps Lulu while they are pursued by a hooded figure that cannot die. Oh, and it's in the desert and sort of Western-y.

It has the aesthetic of a Suicide Girls shoot. This short makes Requiem for a Dream seem subtle.

<b>T is for Toilet — Lee Hardcastle \*\*</b>
Two parents teach their child how to use the toilet. The line between nightmare and reality blurs.

Like a cheaper and extra gory Celebrity Death Match.

<b>U is for Unearthed — Ben Wheatley \*\*.5</b>
A vampire evades a mob attempting to kill him.

Another POV short. I appreciate the conceit, even if the execution only mildly works.

<b>V is for Vagitus — Kaare Andrews \*.5</b>
In 2035, women will have to petition the government to bear children. A police officer and her robot assistant break into a facility to eliminate a baby born to a psychic.

Way too convoluted for the time allotted, so it's just people explaining everything the whole time. It would've been better as a comic. Makes sense, since Kaare Andrews is a comic book artist.

<b>W is for WTF! — Jon Schnepp \*\*</b>
In shitty Adult Swim animation style, a witch feels up a naked woman before stabbing her. A knight comes to save her, but the warlock kills them. Then it goes meta.

Probably the most effortful of any of the shorts. It's so goofy and disgusting.

<b>X is for XXL — Xavier Gens \*</b>
Surrounded by images of thin women, Gertrude must bear constant berating from strangers about her weight.

What a French-ass short — nothing is scarier than being above the median weight.

<b>Y is for Youngbuck — Jason Eisener \*</b>
A janitor teaches a student how to hunt deer and then sexually assaults him. The janitor's proclivities go to disgusting lengths.

This is shot like a comedy. You know, rape revenge, but it's a child. Hilarious, right?

<b>Z is for Zetsumetsu — Yoshihiro Nishimura \*\*</b>
I think I got too high to understand this one. It's like, Dr. Strangeluv is shown a bizarre depiction of how similar America and Japan are.

It's <i>Tokyo Gore Police</i> dude being the horniest weirdo he can be. There's a shot where a woman with enormous breasts has a depiction of 9/11 painted on them, and she's shaking them about.
