By this point, the MST3K crew knew this was their penultimate show. So, they did the short "A Case of Spring Fever," which they had considered using off-and-on for years going back to season 3.

I didn't know this was an MST3K movie when I watched it a few years ago, but like some movies they do, it's better than they give it credit. The third act, in particular, rules.

- Live nude worms
- If I see you even one more time, that'll be three times
- The Dalai Lama says I must honor all living creatures
- The mind-meld doesn't work on dead people
- Stop having worms in your body, you idiot!
- You know I'm perfectly smooth!
