**Rating:** 3/5

By this point, the MST3K crew knew this was their penultimate show. So, they did the short "A Case of Spring Fever," which they had considered using off-and-on for years going back to season 3. 

I didn't know this was an MST3K movie when I watched it a few years ago, but like some movies they do, it's better than they give it credit. The third act, in particular, rules.

* Live nude worms
* If I see you even one more time, that'll be three times
* The Dalai Lama says I must honor all living creatures
* The mind-meld doesn't work on dead people
* Stop having worms in your body, you idiot!
* You know I'm perfectly smooth!
