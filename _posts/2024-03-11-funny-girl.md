**Rating:** /5

A friend demanded we watch this after <i>Brokeback Mountain</i>. After some chaos, we put it on. An hour in, they said they hated it and wanted to turn it off.

I liked what I saw, especially the colorful and wild costumes. But I was also drunk and tired, so I'm going to have to watch this from the beginning at some point.
