The Universal intro skips and repeats several times. The bell rings at 9 AM on the Loyola University campus, waking up Tree Gelbman. She is painfully hungover in a classmate named Carter's dorm room. Carter's got a <i>They Live</i> poster, an <i>MST3K: The Movie</i> poster, and a <i>Repo Man</i> poster, so he's the love interest and/or the killer. She does the walk of shame, encountering people in particular outfits and getting stuck in memorable moments, so we'll recognize them when this loops later. Tree runs into Tim, who she went on a date with once and now won't leave her alone. She insults his penis size, and he gives her the "I'm a murder suspect" face.

Back at her sorority house, her housemate Lori gives Tree a rundown of all the debaucherous shit she did last night before giving her a birthday cupcake she made from scratch. Because Tree hasn't learned the true meaning of Christmas or whatever, she throws the cupcake away. She enters class late, eye-fucking her professor. Later, she tries to fuck him in his office, but his wife shows up and interrupts. That night, she heads to a party. Going through a tunnel, she sees a music box playing Happy Birthday. A guy in a baby mask chases her down and stabs her.

She wakes up in the morning and is in Carter's dorm, hungover and annoyed at herself for ending up here again. But as more things happen to her — those things I mentioned earlier — she realizes she's experienced them all before. When she gets to the music box in the tunnel, she thinks she's pegged it and takes a different route to the party. But while at the party, the killer gets her. By the NEXT morning, she… nope. Okay, the NEXT NEXT morning, she figures out she's in a time loop.

Have you figured out the killer yet? Don't worry. Everyone she meets has a reason.

I don't mind the time loop troupe. <i>Palm Springs</i> is a pretty stellar example. This movie, however, is content to hit every possible cliche. They could have had fun with the kills, but those are the least considered parts of the movie.

There's <b>a lot</b> of ableist humor mocking several groups with special needs. I get it—these characters are <b>that</b> terrible that they would make such jokes. But there are other ways of conveying their thoughtlessness. This movie didn't come out <b>that</b> long ago, did it?

The <i>Sixteen Candles</i> reference was cute.

It's not a bad movie—I get why the folks who love it do—but it just didn't do much for me.
