Meat Loaf and Rick Howland are hunting a cute little puppet with obscene feet—half star for the absolutely inspired Hank the Yeti design.

* Crouching Meat, Hidden Loaf
* He's holding my hand! He's gnawing on it! He's drawing blood! He's pulling each finger off one by one!
* Move the sick creature's disgusting feet closer to our food.
* I just have to call the widows of the men we lost on that grueling expedition, and then I'll be up.
* Action Loaf!
* Comic device coming through!
* Comedy clarinet — it helps your audience know that something funny is ostensibly happening. Pair goofy timpany with comedy clarinet for a laugh riot. Now available with kooky cowbell!
* — She's good. — How good is she? — Real good. — Be more specific! — Not good enough. — Oh, okay!
* What kind of loaf would you say I am?
