<b><a href="https://boxd.it/BQGCY/detail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oh My Horror 2025 | 44/52 | Halloween</a></b>

It's Hell Night, a Halloween costume bash and fraternity initiation night for Alpha Sigma Rho. The fraternity president, Peter, flirts with sorority sisters but pauses when he sees a new pledge, Marti, walk in. A sorority sister named May has helped the lower-class Marti by giving her a lovely dress and a car so she can make a good impression. A window breaks, and a frat guy pukes — that's Peter and fellow frat member Scott's cue to get the pledge initiation started.

The participants and audience get in a convoy of convertibles and drive away. They arrive at the gates of Garth Manor. Peter shoots the lock off and ushers the party in. The pledges must stay in the manor for one night, as stated by the wealthy pledge, Jeff. Pledge Denise gives the background of the mansion: namely, that former estate owner Raymond Garth murdered his family and then committed suicide. Peter fills in the remaining details as he leads the pledges through the gardens and to the mansion's doors—meanwhile, the final pledge, Seth, talks about hunting for sport and scaring Oahu natives with guns.

Seth and Denise find a bedroom and share some pleasantries in their underwear. Marti lights some candles and shares a conversation with Jeff:

<blockquote><i>— Oh, so you're rich.<br>
— You say that like it was a disease. […] What makes it so evil to be rich, and so noble to be poor?<br>
—  Oh, it's just that the rich capitalist feeds on the life of the downtrodden poor.</i></blockquote>

Meanwhile, Peter, Scott, and May sneak in to set up some scary moments for the pledges, such as piping in screams from a hidden speaker. Jeff and Seth find it quickly and dismantle it. Peter sends May off to set up another scare. While circling the mansion, a hand reaches out from the ground, scratching and pulling May down into the hole. Once there, a man raises a cleaver and decapitates her.

The pledges hear screaming again and investigate, leaving Marti to herself. A stiff wind blows open the windows and snuffs the candles. She runs to where the gang is, but the doors are locked. She looks back and sees what appears to be a ghostly apparition walking through the hall. Fraternity scare? Or something more? Who (or what) grabbed May?

Despite the slasher concept, the movie leans more toward Gothic horror in its atmosphere and pacing. I could see the paint-by-numbers formula boring audiences, looking for something more energetic. But let's be clear: the murders are slasher-level violent with all sorts of head trauma. The kills are just so few and uninspired.

Perhaps the most standout aspects of the movie are its moments that touch on class and how our final girl's know-how helps her survive. Linda Blair is sort of perfect for this role, as her matter-of-fact delivery feels practical and knowing. She also comes across as so earnest and kind that I don't want anything bad to happen to her.

I'm not saying this is a good movie — I'm just saying, despite its many flaws, I still enjoyed it.

#### Stray Thoughts / Spoilers

- I like the opener one-er as the camera moves through the raccous party. It creates a greater sense of scale than if the camera cut to each moment.
- The movie, even by 80s standards, has some horribly ableist dialogue.
- Oh wow, I haven't heard the piano tickle horror sting this overtly in a non-parody.
- Suki Goodwin is a type that few movies portray. She really only did this movie.
- Seth psyches himself up for sex by saying, "Score another one for the good guys."
- Kevin Brophy looks like a handsome Jarad Padalecki.
- Oh yikes, I just realized who the killer is.
