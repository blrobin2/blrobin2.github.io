<b><a href="https://boxd.it/xqceO">Bullets, Bombs, and Babes: The Raunchy Spycraft of Andy Sedaris</a></b>

<blockquote><i>Cody, we heard you’re a private investigator, and we wondered if you’d investigate our privates.</i></blockquote>

Cody Abilene is a wealthy playboy and self-proclaimed private eye. He lives in a private marina owned by his daddy on a yacht called the Malibu Express. He drives a red De Lorean DMC 12. His gun of choice is a Dan Wesson Model 15-VH revolver, which he carries in a cowskin case. He can’t shoot for shit, but that doesn’t stop him from his weekly visits to the gun range.

Even though he can’t hit a target, he can certainly score. Every woman he encounters is at least desperate to fuck him. Just ask his car-racing friend, June Khnockers. Or his new neighbors, May and Faye, who don’t have a shower and need to borrow his.

Yes sir, Cody is the redneck James Bond, complete with fancy gadgets like a readout pager and a tape recorder. He’s also hotter than any Bond I’ve seen.

Contessa Luciana meets with government intelligence operative Douglas F. Wilton to discuss how Russians steal computer technology. Douglas suggests Cody investigate for them. Cody and Contessa go dancing and fuck before she agrees.

So, 20 minutes into the movie, Cody gets into some plot. His mission is to stay at the Chamberlain mansion in Bel Air and see what they’re up to. What sort of hijinks will Cody be getting into while investigating these socialites?

Andy Sedaris has the spirit of Russ Meyer — here, he blends stupid humor, wall-to-wall nude scenes, and as many cool cars as possible. Like Clint Ramsey in Supervixen, Cody can’t escape the eyes of buxom ladies with one thing on their mind.

Where Andy Sedaris has Meyer beat is that Sedaris knows how to shoot all genders with a lustful eye. We get a variety of muscular boys to complement the Playboy models who litter the movie, including henchmen Matthew, Mark, and Luke.
<blockquote><i>— He’s a pretty boy, ain’t he?
— You looking to fuck him?
— Yeah, maybe!</i></blockquote>Henry Strzelecki’s roots-style country plays throughout. It was disorienting in the opening credits, where a woman types on a computer with long, red nails, spelling out the credits for us. But as it goes and we get to know Cody, it fits.

Of course, it’s not without its problems. Despite its bisexual gaze, it has some homophobic slurs and plays a drag queen character for laughs. But she’s also hot and fully committed — even Cody can’t help but admire her. And the only person to use slurs is a villain. So, it’s hard to draw an easy conclusion on the intent.

This movie is shameless, tasteless schlock. It never pretends to be anything else. It’s also undeniably entertaining.

How did this movie get an R rating??
