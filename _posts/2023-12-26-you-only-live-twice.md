<b><a href="https://boxd.it/r6gwI">Bond, Ranked Bond: The Cold War’s Horniest Spy</a></b>

<b>Stray Thoughts/Spoilers</b>

- It looks like Lewis Gilbert made the most expensive Bond movies until <i>Tomorrow Never Dies</i>.
- "Why do Chinese girls taste different from other girls?" — Time to saddle up for some racist misogyny.
- Ahh, this is where Kenneth's <i>30 Rock</i> scene comes from.
- Screenplay by Roald Dahl. That explains the rampant racism.
- Bond's fake death rivals Sherlock's in terms of inexplicability.
- "Stirred, not shaken, right?"
- Freddie Young's cinematography is an upgrade — the fights look like actual fights for the first time.
- Bond complains about Siamese vodka — funny, considering Thailand has never produced local vodka.
- Sean Connery's toupée is more visible — they didn't match the color well.
- — "In Japan, men come first, not women." — "I think I'll retire here."
- Alright, the mini helicopter with a flame thrower has won me over.
- A SPECTRE ship swallowing a Russian ship and taking it to a volcano lair! Hello, Hank Scorpio.
- The ninja training sequence
- SURGICALLY APPLIED YELLOWFACE???
- Poison down the thread!
- Kissy Suzuki
- This movie is the de facto inspiration for <i>Austin Powers</i>.
- Donald Pleasence! Why did he only play Blofeld once? He played Loomis like five times.
