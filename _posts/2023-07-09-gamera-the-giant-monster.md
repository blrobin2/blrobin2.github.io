Someday, I’d like to see the original Japanese version, since folks claim it’s a better movie than the Sandy Frank cut

- Oh death from on high, neat!
- I wanna see him kill the turtle
- Hey look at his neck, 666
- I am your bride!
- Great thing about being a turtle is that you don’t have to separate your laundry… cuz it’s green
- Yes, he’ll kill us all, that’s a great idea!
- He’s heading for that stain up there
  And of course
- Kenny!
