#### The Black Hair: \*\*\*

The story kind of ambles a bit, but the final sequence is good

#### The Woman of the Snow: \*\*\*\*\*

Amazing colors, surreal backdrops, eerie vibes throughout

#### Hoichi the Earless: \*\*\*\*\*

I love the opening sequence: cutting between the ships and the prints of the battles to show scale, and the singing narration. The rest is good, too, itâ€™s just a a striking start

#### In a Cup of Tea: \*\*\*\*.5

A weird tone to this one, mostly on board, especially with the incompleteness of the story, but not as sublimely beautiful as the prior two

The first story made me think was going to be campier than it than the rest of it actually is. Despite being over 3 hours, I was engaged throughout
