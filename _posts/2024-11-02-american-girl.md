**Rating:** 3.5/5

I was lucky enough to watch this with a Taiwanese family who recognized many of this movie's small details. The performances were excellent, with Caitlin Fang giving the best.

The movie's slight nature is attractive at first blush, but its lack of commitment to its threads prevents any story tension from developing. I never connected to what was happening to the characters. I felt underwhelmed by the ending.

This film is well-made â€” I appreciate how it dodges melodrama, but it also dodges drama in the process.
