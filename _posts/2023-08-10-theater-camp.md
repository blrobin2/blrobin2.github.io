I went in knowing this wouldn't be for me — I did theater in high school, but I was not a theater kid, nor did I go to theater camp. Much of this movie's humor derives from not just knowing theater experience but being a Broadway nerd

But not all of it! There were some genuine laughs, the final show the kids put on is a treat — the songs are both well-written and funny, which is hard as hell to do

While I wish Ben Platt would have stuck to a behind-the-scenes role in this, he wasn't completely insufferable. But his character was pretty one-note and grating, and will be the number one reason this movie doesn't end up on more
best-of lists

Shout out to the person in the audience who was belly-laughing at all the jokes, gasping at the cameos — this movie was made specifically for them, and I am happy it exists for them
