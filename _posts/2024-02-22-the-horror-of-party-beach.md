The monsters are funny, and there are a couple of decent scenes, but beach party parts are rough-going. Fun climax!

* Will he shift? Will the wheel move?
* We're not even speaking the same language anymore. I'm speaking Esperanto these days.
* The monster immediately gets up and puts on his Metal Machine Music
* My skull!
* I'm starting to agree with the Taliban
* Thanks for coming out to help me, my pipe is stuck in my mouth
* Hey, Mars exploded
* Gentleman, I have a list of meats I'd like to read
* The music's coming from inside the radio!
