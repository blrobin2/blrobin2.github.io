Whoops, got too high. Let's see how this plays out

<b>Thoughts/Spoilers</b>

- Guy walking around your car. Date says forget about him so we can snog some more
- I like the melting Santa opening credits
- "I should look like an old gay queen"
- "Do you think we have a psychopath on our hands?"
- Headline says "Santa Slain"
- Police chief's wife randy for some Santa murder details
- Nothing consoles a grieving woman more than a porn shoot
- The slowest pan up and down of the model's body — no shame, director
- Murderer sneaks into a peep show to kill the Santa at his horniest
- Santa in hell — The London Dungeon, to be precise
- This is like a Scooby-Doo where they only introduce one new character
- Lopping the penis off at the urinal. Brutal
- Okay it's not Santas, it's Christmas — or evil or something?
- He saw mommy fucking Santa Claus
- ...and then it just ends
