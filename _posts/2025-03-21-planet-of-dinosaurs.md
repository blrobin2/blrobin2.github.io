**Rating:** 1.5/5

For fans of <i>45</i> and <i>Mission to Mars</i>, this movie gives <i>Lost Continent</i> a run for its money in terms of the time spent watching people traverse rocks. There can't be more than 10 minutes of dinosaurs in this movie.

* We return to the planet, already infested with dinosaurs.
* Take it! Stop not taking it!
* You saw a dinosaur? Up here? On the planet of dinosaurs?
* Keith Emerson's up there throwing chunks of progressive rock at them
* — Tracks. It must be nearby. — A cave! It was nearby!
* Sometimes aggression is necessary, like when you're negotiating with a babysitter.
* I'm not hungry, you idiots. I'm just trying to walk off your friends.
