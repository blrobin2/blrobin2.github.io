**Rating:** 1.5/5

In a future (?) where Violent Orphan Boys (VOBs) run rampant (?) Jessica forms a support group/cult (?) of these VOBs, arming them to fight the Special Forces, who are trying to take them out (?)

We enter this world through a VOB named Kevin, whom Jessica's group finds and adopts. Just as we start learning anything about these boys, the Special Forces, represented by a swarm of drones, kill Kevin (aka our audience surrogate), and the boys run into hiding on an island

One of the boys, named Michael, meets Camille on the island. She likes his muscles (?), he tells her he has committed every atrocity imaginable, so they have sex and fall in love

Another boy named Lucas sees the ghost of his sister Andrea, whom he killed for no apparent reason — this seems to be Lucas' deal

The closest thing I can compare this to is <i>Only God Forgives</i>, where people stand around in silence and make speeches, all in beautiful cinematography. Why anything is happening is up in the air. Why the movie ends just before a proposed climax could only be attributed to budgetary restrictions — too much money spent on the lovely house they hide out in and the nice chandelier they break (?)

I don't mind a tone poem, despite hating that term, but I assume the poem has clear thematic elements at play. Here, the viewer must construe any theme. Is this an incel army? Is this a recovery group?

There's a scene where the boys come across the littlest kitten, and they all take turns holding it — half a star for the kitten
