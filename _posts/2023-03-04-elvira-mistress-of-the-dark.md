Happy to know the Amish are also fans of Elvira

“There’s nothing wrong with G-rated movies, as long as there’s lots of sex and violence”

Doing a <i>Flashdance</i>-inspired burlesque for a theater full of teens is… weird, right?

The final number is fun and campy minus the poorly aged rap segment…

Overall, it’s dumb as hell, but it never takes itself seriously
