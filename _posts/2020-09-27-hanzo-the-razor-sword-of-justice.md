**Rating:** 1.5/5

Samurai cop who loves to torture himself uses his big penis to “interrogate” women and his house full of traps to take out would-be assassins. Complete with blood spray by the gallons, a funky soundtrack, and some inventive cinematography; the movie gets points for being super weird, but not much else. Gen X would call it “misunderstood” or something
