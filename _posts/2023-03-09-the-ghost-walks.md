This has a lot of my favorite tropes in it, I just don’t think this is a particularly excellent execution of them

Johnny Arthur seems very queer coded, the way he talks and behaves. He also gives off major Smithers vibes with his boss

I might have appreciated this more if the film had been given some restoration, but as it is, it’s pretty okay
