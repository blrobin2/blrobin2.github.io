The most realistic part of this movie was the detectives relying on a child psychic for clues because <a href="https://www.ojp.gov/ncjrs/virtual-library/abstracts/psychics-and-police-work" rel="nofollow">cops regularly go to clairvoyants for unsolved cases</a> and weirdly still have <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3566383" rel="nofollow">astronomically low clearance rates</a>… 🤔

#### Spoilers below

… and most importantly, that plot line is meaningless beyond showing the ineptness of cops since the kid got out on his own

Ending reminded me a lot of <i>Signs</i> in that sort of “everything you’ve experienced has prepared you for this moment” way, but more so of <i>Home Alone</i> in the cartoony booby trap way
