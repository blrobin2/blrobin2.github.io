Four documentary filmmakers traveled to the Green Inferno, a part of the Amazon populated by cannibal tribes. They never came back.

A rescue team goes into the Amazon to find the documentary crew. The unit comes back with the crew's footage.

They discovered that the documentarians deliberately staged events to create shock value. This includes several animal mutilations, raping native women, and forcing members of the tribe into a hut and setting it on fire. They filmed the whole thing.

It's the classic exploitation move. You show people doing horrible things, then show them getting their comeuppance.

Except the people doing horrible things were the people making this film.

I've read the arguments that this is social commentary. I'm not convinced.

I once again ruined my life by letting curiosity get the best of me.
