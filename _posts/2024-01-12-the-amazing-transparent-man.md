**Rating:** 2/5

* Am I that amazingly transparent?
* I'm glad its not the annoying transparent man
* I'm not really adjusting to society, will you take me back to prison?
* Ooo, they've got Protestant Revival furniture
* Bargain? Faust? Get it??
* All this just to get a UHF station?
* They're going to record a Yes album
* So they've come up with new ways to off guinea pigs
* Think about it: people will think there isn't a guinea pig in the room when there is!
* I'm breaking all the guinea pigs outta this place!
* Hey! This is not my beautiful house
* We carpooled from the Ottoman Empire
* I'm so invisible right now. I've never not been less invisible
* Oppenheimer cupped Einstein's breasts as Nils Bohr let his mock slip to the lab floor
* Either he's invisible or the rice is done
* I'll be right back after this
