If I wrote down every line that made me laugh, I would be writing down practically every line. But some favorites:

<blockquote><i>This double date is going to be great. And if not, it's not our fault, cuz I have no flaws, and neither do you. That's what feminism is!</i></blockquote><blockquote><i>Oh, I've read before. And I'll read again.</i></blockquote><blockquote><i>People have tried to break my bones. They actually will not break.</i></blockquote>
