**Rating:** /5

I went to Bruce-O-Rama with Bruce Campbell at Carolina Theater. There was a game show that Bruce hosted called Last Fan Standing before the movie, and it was entertaining, but the nerds in the audience were so vocally angry when someone onstage didn’t know their favorite IP

Just before the movie was a quick Q&A, and I should’ve known what was to come based on the range of questions, from hyper-specific questions that Campbell could only answer with, “I don’t know, I didn’t write the thing” to “desperate for laughs” questions like “is mayonnaise considered a musical instrument?” (Not kidding)

I haven’t seen this movie since high school, and I was eager to give it a reevaluation as someone who has come to love horror more than my younger self. The wrong venue for that, I guess

If you ever have the chance to watch Evil Dead 2 with an auditorium of Bruce Campbell fans, don’t. A miserable experience of nerds trying to out-riff each other over every second of the movie. I gave it as long as I could manage, but I couldn’t sit through the movie with this audience

Next time I’ll try the Alamo or some venue where people like watching movies
