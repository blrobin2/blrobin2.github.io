**Rating:** 2.5/5

Is this Bill Murray’s best performance pre-Wes Anderson?

I might hold more of a fondness for this movie had I seen it at a younger age. Today, it’s pretty hard to watch, in part because SO MUCH of the comedy in this is the “… but that’s a man” — not all of it, there’s still some humor elsewhere, but it’s buried — “I don’t take this shit from friends, only lovers,” is pretty funny

What makes some of it go down a bit smoother is when the movie allows you to see just how predatory and irredeemable Dustin Hoffman’s character is

That said, the movie, intentionally or not, tries to validate his choices by showing how shitty all the men are, and that it took him doing this to see just how shitty men are. “I didn’t mean to hurt anybody,” isn’t an apology, and yet…

It’s a well-acted, we’ll-structured movie, and I wish I could apply the “… for its time” label and feel better about it but I don’t
