**Rating:** 2/5

Two couples rent cabins in the wilderness for the weekend, and one couple brings their two kids along.

While there, they find a trail near their cabins. Machete in hand, they forge through and come across a massive abandoned building.

Inside the building, they find a bottomless pit. The pit seems to draw the kids in. One kid tries to step off the ledge, but Ben stops them.

Back at the camp, after a horrifying vision, Ben notices unusual behavior from the kids. To his dismay, no one else notices, and they grow frustrated with his accusations.

This is so stressful! Kids are the fucking worst. The movieâ€™s biggest problem is that it relies on mediocre kid actors to do a lot of acting, and as their role becomes more complex, the film loses steam.

Overall, I like the idea behind this, but the execution left me wanting.
