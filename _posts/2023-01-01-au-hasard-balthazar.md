After watching <i>EO</i>, I figured I’d watch the film that influenced it, and by comparison this makes <i>EO</i> all the more confounding in its motivations

I didn’t connect with the story that much, the misery and cruelty at times felt like it was for its own sake, which I guess makes it more “real” but we have so much misery porn in the world

I feel like I may need to rewatch this at some point
