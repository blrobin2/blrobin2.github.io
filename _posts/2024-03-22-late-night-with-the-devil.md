During the 1970s, Jack Delroy hosted a late-night talk show called Night Owls. Though trying to compete with Carson, the show had middling reviews. When Jack took the show in a Jerry Springer-like direction, the show tanked. So, during sweeps week and on Halloween night, Jack puts together a show guaranteed to get big ratings.

The most apt comparisons areÂ <i>Ghostwatch</i> or <i>WNUF Halloween Special</i>, but this movie breaks the illusion with "behind the scenes" footage filmed in <i>The Office</i> style.

While a little long and cheap-looking, the movie is fun and creates memorable visuals. I was enthralled for most of the movie, which is more than I can say for several horror movies.
