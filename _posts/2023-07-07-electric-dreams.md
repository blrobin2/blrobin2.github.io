The easiest way to sum up the plot would be Cyrano de Bergerac if he were a computer

This script feels like an AI wrote it — nothing progresses logically, and no one talks like a person. But I think it’s intentional

The film aspires to be more of an extended music video than a formal story. And the moments with soundtrack music are great. The visuals are reminiscent of the early abstract animators at times, and others are pure 80s aesthetics — I love it all

It’s fluffy and inconsequential, but it feels so good

<b>Stray Thoughts</b>

- I love the opening credits
- Oh hey, it’s the recluse from Twin Peaks!
- The first time I can recall seeing a computer illiterate make their house “smart”
- Really cool visuals — the champagne running over the circuit board
- Ooo, stay past the credits for a little goodbye
