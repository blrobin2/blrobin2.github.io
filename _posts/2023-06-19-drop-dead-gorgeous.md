**Rating:** 2.5/5

Mockumentary about a local beauty pageant that heats up when some of the contestants die in mysterious accidents

Awful first act! It gets funnier when it gets darker and weirder, and it’s a shame that it doesn’t start there. That said, it’s still lazy as hell, and it’s only the outstanding performances that this functions at all

Kirstie Alley is terrible in this. I’m glad it’s an ensemble movie, but she’s in it so much and doesn’t land a single joke

Kirsten Dunst does her best, but the accent is rough. Still, she’s charming and energetic and gets by

Allison Janney steals every scene she’s in, she finds a character to play that works, even if it’s broad and overdone

Britney Murphy pulls out her Luanne Platter and it never doesn’t make me laugh. She’s so good in this, and probably the funniest person in the movie

Denise Richards has done roles similar enough to this that she can get by on just doing her thing. Still, one of the stronger performances

I like the idea of this more than what is onscreen. It has the editing of a Christopher Guest movie, but not the script or performances to make this stand out

That said, it’s not like this is taking itself all that seriously, so it’s an easygoing view. I probably would like this more if they workshopped some of the jokes and found a consistent tone
