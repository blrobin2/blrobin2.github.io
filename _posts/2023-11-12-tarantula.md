A disheveled man walks through the desert, collapsing on the sand. He has a deformed face, and his veins bulge out of his skin.

The sheriff calls Dr. Hastings to diagnose what happened to a dead body. Dr. Hastings thinks it's biologist Eric Jacobs, but he isn't sure. Professor Deemer arrives and verifies that it is his friend and partner of 30 years, Eric Jacobs.

Deemer claims it is acromegalia — a disorder where excessive growth hormones cause parts of the body to grow beyond their typical size.

The problem? Acromegalia takes years to develop, and Eric appeared fine to everyone just last week.

At Deemer's lab, he prepares an injection to give to a white rat. As we survey the lab, we see animals far beyond their typical sizes — a guinea pig, a rat, and a tarantula.

Another of Deemer's assistants, also suffering from acromegalia, attacks Deemer. He destroys the lab, accidentally letting the tarantula escape.

Dr Hastings drives newcomer Stephanie Clayton to Deemer's lab. She is to be his assistant.

Deemer explains to Hastings and Clayton his synthetic nutrients to grow larger animals to feed an ever-growing population.

As time passes, we get occasional glimpses of the tarantula. Each time, it has grown bigger.

Soon, the sheriff receives reports of cattle being stripped to the bone and puddles of unidentifiable white paste. 

Another doctor verifies — it's tarantula venom. 

Unlike <i>Them!</a>, the science is complete nonsense, but they do share radioactive isotopes as the secret sauce. Also, unlike <i>Them!</i>, once the movie ramps up, it doesn't pump the brakes.

Hastings and Clayton have decent chemistry. They both give charming performances.

I also enjoy the small talk between characters. It develops character without being idle and reflects a general kindness to everyone that I appreciate.

The effects, while obvious, are very well done! The scaling and perspective are smart, at least compared to other sci-fi shlock that just scales it up as big as it can.

This is a standout 50s Sci-Fi flick. It isn't brilliant, but it sure is fun.
