<blockquote><i>There are two worlds of magic. One is the glittering domain of the illusionist. The other is a secret place where magic is a terrifying reality. Here, men have the power of demons. And Death itself is an illusion.</i></blockquote>


<b>The Mojave Desert, 1982</b>
Nix, who calls himself The Puritan, holds a ball of fire and talks to a congregation of his followers. A man comes in to warn Nix that Swann arrived. Swann is a former congregant. He, Quaid, and other former congregants are going to stop Nix from sacrificing a child that they have kidnapped.

Swann confronts Nix, and Nix touches Swann's brain, causing him to have demented visions of people ripping apart. The kidnapped girl shoots Nix, and the others put a binding mask on Nix, effectively killing him.


<b>New York City 1995</b>
Private detective Harry D'Amour mourns the outcome of a recent exorcism in Brooklyn. The police connect Harry to several occult-related cases and consider him "dubious." Loomis finds Harry after three days holed up in his place. Loomis gives Harry an insurance fraud case in LA.

The case takes Harry to Quaid, now a fortune teller, and Nix's congregants torturing Quaid. After a kerfuffle, Quaid gives Harry a palm reading:

<blockquote><i>You're drawn to the dark side over and over. You don't like that. You can't change it. You must walk the line between heaven and hell. It is your destiny. Accept it.</i></blockquote>

Before Quaid dies, he tells Harry that The Puritan is returning. The case pulls Harry in, and he can't escape it.

I'm not the biggest Clive-Barker-as-director fan. I like Hellraiser but don't love Night Breed as much as others.

The story reminds me of Jim Butcher's <i>Dresden Files</i> novels and other "magic noir" stories. I don't hate it in concept, but this movie doesn't have the budget to realize this story.

Scott Bacula is a treasure despite only ever playing himself. He's sweaty and shirtless sometimes, which is pretty neat.

The special effects range from "pretty cool" to "David Lynch's <i>Dune</i>," but they're all fun.

The movie's biggest problem is how slow it is. It thinks we care about the characters, but there isn't enough character for anyone to warrant caring.

For a particular horror movie nerd, this is what they want. Most people will find this too indulgent. It has a perspective that I appreciate. It doesn't make the best use of the material.
