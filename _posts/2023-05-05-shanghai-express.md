I love how<i> in medias res </i>this movie starts. Eveyone knows someone on the train, everyone has a secret, and most importantly, the film isn’t interested in filling in most of those stories for you — fitting considering how much spy work is happening in the background

The camera looks through shadows cast on pulled curtains and a veil of darkness to people’s backs and silhouettes — you are another stranger on the train, learning what you are privileged to see

The Americans and Brits are insufferable and racist and make the ride worse for everyone around them. I get the intent, but it does become unbearable at times

Marlene Dietrich carries herself with such charm and wit. The camera knows how to fill the screen with her face so that we get every subtle change as she fluctuates between flirtatious and sincere

Perfect lighting! The moment with the soldiers in the fog sneaking onto the train gave me chills. Also when Dietrich is in complete shadow except for her bejeweled hands joined together in prayer

One of the best early Hollywood movies I’ve seen — so intelligent and captivating. I would die if I ever had the opportunity to see this in a theater
 
“The Chinese government would’ve had my head years ago if it wasn’t such a good head” — iconic
