<b><a href="https://boxd.it/rIGbC/detail">Cult Movie Challenge 2024 | 45/52 | Uwe Boll</a></b>

I'm watching the 162-minute director's cut because god has abandoned us.

The Krug kill Zeph and kidnap Solana, so it's up to Farmer, Norick, and Bastian to traverse the kingdom of Ehb and rescue Solana. But soon, they'll learn of the powerful Magus Gallian, who is romancing Muriella, the daughter of Magus Merrick, who serves King Konreid with Commander Tarish. Don't worryâ€” Elora and the nymphs make an appearance, too.

Yes, all your favorite Dungeon Siege characters are here, played by actors who definitely look like they belong in this world!

This movie has so many fight sequences, and they all look identical.

Matthew Lillard is great. Ray Liotta is so funny. Bert Reynolds looks at the camera.

In a world where so many projects never take off, Uwe Boll receives 60 million dollars to make this. Not only that but there are TWO sequels. Cool.
