**Rating:** /5

The camera ogles and lingers but artfully obscures with clothing, bodies, extreme close-up. Like, it isn’t well-composed or even inherently intentional, but the smash cuts, the light bleeds, the wandering eye and odd juxtapositions do give the movie a particular style

The story, as thin as it is, does convey a longing for love and what someone who has been through abusive relationships will put up with in the hopes of having love
