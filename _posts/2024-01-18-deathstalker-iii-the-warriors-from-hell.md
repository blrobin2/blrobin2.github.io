* Let's see how long these accents last
* — Die! — Okay!
* Oh no, this is a sequel to something 
* If I knew your name or anything about you, this would be very sad
* 57 oracles and nothing on
* Get em, man! He kicked Tony!
* Deathstalker, you scamp!
* Larry told me what to do if they tried to saddle me
* Goodbye, hope your perm works out!
* This guy peaked in the middle ages
* Stalking Death, as usual
* — What's your name? — I smelled your food! — Hey, that was the last guy's name too!
* This movie made it possible for two actors to put "stage fighting" on their resume
* There can be only one or two!
