**Rating:** 1.5/5

I don’t remember why I got this movie to watch…

It doesn’t really do anything all that well, and it’s too boring to be an awesomely bad watch. The werewolf acting is pretty funny but it isn’t really in a whole lot of the movie

If you have an insatiable need for no-budget exploitation flicks, you could do worse than this
