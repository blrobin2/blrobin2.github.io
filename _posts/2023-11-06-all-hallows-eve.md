**Rating:** 1.5/5

On Halloween night, Timmy and Tia go through their candy haul. An unlabeled VHS tape falls out of Timmy's candy bag. The babysitter is understandably reluctant, but the kids won't give it up, so she agrees to watch it.

<b>Segment 1: <i>The 9th Circle</i></b>

At the train station, Art the Clown harasses a woman. He knocks her out and chains her into an asylum with three other women. A bunch of bad things happen to them, including a pregnant woman having her baby cut out of her and Satan raping one of them.

The babysitter is over it and sends the kids to bed. Scared, Tia slips out of her room and into bed with Timmy. The babysitter continues watching.

<b>Segment 2: <i>???</i></b>

A fruity alien attacks a woman who just moved to the suburbs.

<b>Segment 3: <i>Terrifier</i></b>

Art the Clown stalks a woman at a gas station, chopping up the attendant and performing surgical torture on her.

The last segment with the babysitter is the only good part, so I'll save it for you, in case you're interested.

Overall, this is a pretty soulless and lackluster anthology collection. It's clear that Leone only cares about the last segment. The middle one looks like a quick short film made to fill time. The first segment is a leftover short film from 2006.

I still intend to check out <i>Terrifier</i>, but I'm more reluctant than before.
