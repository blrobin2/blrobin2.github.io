**Rating:** 2/5

The final mini-season on Comedy Central! We get a new intro since TV's Frank is gone, and I guess it's only for six episodes. The intro feels empty without Frank.

We also get Pearl back as a recurring Mad

I'm watching the Thanksgiving version â€” I think the only difference between it and the re-run version is the segments

Everyone's laughing at each other's riffs a lot more. I think it helps create a more lighthearted vibe

* From a sentence by Gene Corman
* Someone's burning leaves, and NASA is there
* Should've sent up a dog first
* This is like Night of the Ground Squirrel
* I want you to see this. Look how dead he is!
* We had to snap him in two like a frozen dog to get him out of the space capsule
* Huh, he's a little low on air
* This is a stupid space program! I'm gonna go work at my uncle's space program
* What I'm about to say may sound insane, but I think we should eat this corpse.
* Steve? Steve and I have something to tell you
* Psst! Did you put the blood beast out?
* Another long scene in here should help
* Ah, my head! My achy breaky head!
* I'm hiding in here because the dogs keep burying me and digging me up
* He hates that rock!
