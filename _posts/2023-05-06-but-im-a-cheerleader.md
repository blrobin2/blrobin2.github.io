Excellent 90s color palate. Truly obsessed with all of the duo-tone scenes

The formula is pretty threadbare, but the execution is cozy. And you have to appreciate queer representation and gender deconstruction that’s well-made and funny

I’m just over conversion therapy as a central plot point to a queer story. Thankfully, this is such a silly, satirical approach that it isn’t quite as painful, but the parents still say some rough stuff. Also, I don’t miss the 90s and the comfort everyone had with the F-slur

Still, happy this exists!

#### Stray Thoughts

- Ru Paul with a goatee is barely recognizable
- This is the most earnest I’ve seen Natasha Lyonne
- Thank god Melanie Lynsky gets to speak in her Kiwi accent
- Oh, hey, Rufio!
- All the cutouts in the boys' training area are hilarious
