Of course pleased to see Aisha Dee from the Bold Type have a leading role performance

The film has a promising setup, but changes gears into a more cartoonish and, frankly, reductive portrayal of the lead. But if you ignore the characterization of the first half, the ridiculous kills are entertaining and gross

It reminds me in some ways of <i>Ingrid Goes West</i> in that it deals with how people use social media to mask their loneliness

At its core a solid horror movie, it just needed to workshop all the pieces brought up into a cohesive whole
