**Rating:** /5

Striking cinematography, from the vibrant plastics on the conveyor belts to the motion shots of the factory structures. The romantic and adventurous music adds to the sense of “shaping chaos to our needs.”

The narrator says we don’t know where oil comes from, but surely we had an idea by 1958, right?
