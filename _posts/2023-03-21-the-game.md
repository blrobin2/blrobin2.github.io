Rewatching for a podcast

JJ Abrams saw this movie and said, “oh puzzles don’t have to have solutions, they just need to piss you off”

Now, here’s the major difference. The intermediate trip is actually pretty fun and cinematically well put-together, so you can forgive the silliness for the ride

Honestly my biggest complaint is that it’s way too long. You give me 80-90 minutes of this and I’d love it. But 128? C’mon…

#### SPOLIERS

Of course the question at the end of the movie is “how could they have pulled all that off?” And the answer is, “if a movie can fake it, why can’t they?”. It’s not the most satisfying answer, but…

I guess the movie could be a comment on the “poverty tourism” of the rich, and how no matter how bad things get, it’s all still a game to them
