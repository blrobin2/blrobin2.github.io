<i>East Java, 2003</i>

Sri works in a kitchen, unpaid by her boss, though she needs it. Her boss gives her an ad for the Atmojo family, who are looking for helpers.

She arrives at a long line of women, learning that the family had weird, specific conditions. She tries to leave, but a van hits her, and they take her inside to tend to her scrapes.

Mbah Karso asks to see her. Every instinct tells her to leave, but she enters. She makes an irrevocable pact to work for her, cleaning the horrible lesions all over Mbah's body.

But her real task is to care for Mbah's granddaughter, Dela, who is cursed by dark magic. She will be free after 1000 days. When Sri comes on, it's day 995.

Sri witnesses Dela bite one of her coworkers on the hand. She tries to run, but some magic causes her to pass out. So, she is stuck until the five days are up.

The movie has a super slow start. The first forty-five minutes are setup and explained the rules.

Sri makes ridiculous choices given her circumstances. Her empathy makes her an easy mark for the demon. But maybe that's what Dela needs.

The finale is pretty fun and outrageous â€” I wish they did more of that

<b>**_Spoiler Talk_**</b>
If Sri going into the dream is what can save her, why didn't they try the day they found out she had the dream instead of waiting until the last day?

Also, it didn't seem like they had found anyone that could go into the dream like that, so what would they do do if none of the people they hired could do that?

The "you can't know more than that this. Ignorance is God's gift" line is such a cop-out.
