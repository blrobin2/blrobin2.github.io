<b>stray thoughts</b>
* in my mind i keep calling this <i>alita: battle angel</i>
* her eye makeup is inspired
* "I couldn't just start writing about another killer all of the sudden" â€” you mean, like this movie?
* Italians are horny but in, like, the wrong way
* i am in love with the male sex worker wearing a single boxing glove and a tasseled leather jacket
