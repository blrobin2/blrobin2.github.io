<b>1806, Confederation of the Rhine</b>
André Duvalier (Jack Nicholson) rides his horse along the shores. The sun beats down on him, causing him to fall off his horse.

André spots Helene on the beach. He asks her about the way to Copeland and for some drinking water. She passes him without a word and he follows. She shows him clean drinking water and disappears before he can thank her.

He punches some birds while the waves sweep over him and wakes up in the home of Katrina, the witch. He asks for Helene. The woman points to a bird, saying no woman exists with that name.

André gets directions to the castle of Baron von Leppe. There, he learns Helene’s true identity and the myriad secrets in the castle.

You could spend more time talking about the production of this movie over the movie itself. Six directors touched this movie at one point. Corman meant to make a cheapie in a few days. It turned into a tumultuous multi-month ordeal.

The movie I saw was a mess. Corman made a version in the 90s that supposedly ties off the loose ends. Really, it exists so Corman could put a copyright on it.

The movie’s sole redeeming quality is its fantastic Gothic vibes. But with no thread to tie it together, it’s exhausting to pay attention to.
