<b><a href="https://boxd.it/pOmcY/detail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hooptober 9.0</a> | 19/34 | The worst horror sequel from the 1990s that you haven't seen and can access | Decades 6/8 | 1990s</b>

The police wrongly accuse Annie's brother Ethan of murdering the author of a book about the Candyman. Ethan claims it was the Candyman — the same claim he made about their father. Annie doesn't believe in the Candyman, so she summons him in front of her students to dispel their fears. Once the Candyman appears, he leads Annie down a path of trauma to a family secret that will tear them apart... literally!

The first Candyman movie explored how the black body is fetishized and subjected to suffering, turning historical pain into mythology.

This film carries the surface story forward, turning the themes into mere slasher fodder. Blackness in this movie only serves as a mirror for white lessons.

Candyman's given backstory is groan-worthy. The idea has potential. The way it comes together, though, takes away its power.

The movie has a high production value. The gore effects are impressive but end up repetitive and uncreative.

Phillip Glass' film score is the movie's most valuable aspect. It has a sharp blend of classic horror concepts and his signature textures.

Overall, the movie is an ineffective — bordering on offensive — sequel.

#### Stray Thoughts

- The title is quintessentially Clive Barker.
- The cliché Kingfish radio personality sucks.
- Annie and the student standing in front of the window, her hands on his shoulders, his hand on hers — bad touch!
  \*Wait, are she and the student romantically involved??
- The dude in a diaper carrying a massive cross set to haunting music is so funny.
- The scene with the kids poking the dead cat full of bees is uncalled for. So, I guess it's effective?
