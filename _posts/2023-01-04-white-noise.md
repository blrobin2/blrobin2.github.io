**Rating:** 3/5

Adam Driver slack-jawed watching Nazi footage is funny, but he just doesn’t work in this role. In a dream world, it would have been Phillip Seymour Hoffman

Once the airborne toxic event occurs, the movie starts to gel a bit more. I don’t think the visual language — the colors, the cinematography, some costuming — does much for the material, but it does help offset the pacing through the intentionally slow third act

Overall, a bit of a misfire all around, but at least it’s interesting to watch
