<blockquote><i>This is Radio Tokyo, reminding you to take it easy and never volunteer for anythingÂ </i></blockquote>Moments of this movie were almost Python-esque in the absurdity of British bureaucracy. Jingoistic and racist? Yes. Beautifully shot and paced? Yes.

War movies never make me cry, but those Commie writers cut right to the bone. I also blame Technicolor, which never ceases to hit a nostalgic place in my heart. This film is a rare W for the Oscars.

God bless Clifton.
