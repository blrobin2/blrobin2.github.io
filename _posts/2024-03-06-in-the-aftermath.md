An angel carrying an egg is sent to Earth to determine if humanity is worth saving. Meanwhile, Frank and Goose scavenge the irradiated land for supplies. But the earth is a cruel place, and survival is a game of luck.

This movie is loosely based on <i>Angel's Egg</i> and incorporates footage from the OVA. The director's goal was to take the highly surreal and "incomprehensible" anime they had acquired the rights to and make something that general audiences could understand. So, they filmed live-action footage to pair with the anime and dubbed the anime segments with newly written lines.

The result is... hard to pin down. Like, it's insanely cheap. The filmmakers shot all of the live footage at one factory. But it doesn't look terrible. And the transitions from animated to live-action are kind of neat.

It feels like the live-action footage they would integrate with video games in the 90s.

This movie didn't get any distribution outside of the UK until 2019, so I can't imagine they made money on this.

I'm trying to imagine what I would think of this if I had not seen <i>Angel's Egg</i>. I feel like I would just decide to watch it instead.

Can you think of another instance like this?
