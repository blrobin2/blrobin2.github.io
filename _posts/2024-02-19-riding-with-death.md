**Rating:** 1/5

The synopsis on Letterboxd is for a different movie edit that explains why Sam can turn invisible and what the two car-based episodes have in common.

This version is just the two episodes of television poorly glued together.

* Damn, we got dots again
* Stupid molecular structure
* I like him in spite of the fact that he's not me
* He took shop at Harvard Law School
* Get out of here, you dumb car, and don't come back!
