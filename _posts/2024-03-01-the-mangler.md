<i>CW // Blood, Murder, Viscera, Vomit, Incest, Sexism</i>

The film opens at Gartley's Blue Ribbon Laundry service, just outside of Riker's Valley, Maine. At the center is a massive laundry press — the titular Mangler.

Sherry tries to tighten the belt on the machine, cutting her hand. The blood splashes into the press's tread. The machine emits electric bolts, nearly killing her. Still, Mr. Gartley, watching it all unfold, tells everyone to get back to work.

Mrs. Frawley tries to take some antacids, but they fall onto the machine. She reaches to retrieve them, but the machine sucks her in, crushing her to bits. A bloody flesh cube falls out the other end.

Police officer John Hunton, a sweaty asshole with a death wish, investigates the incident. As incidents continue, there's only one logical conclusion — this laundry press is possessed.

<blockquote><i>Mark, check it out. First, there is god, then there's country, and then there's the law. Alright? The rest is bullshit. Alright? This is bullshit, Mark.</i></blockquote>

Those seeking serious horror will be disappointed. This is a ludicrous cartoon. Remember, this is the director who gave us the carnival show that is <i>Texas Chainsaw Massacre II</i>.

Poor Ted Levine — I can't hear his voice without thinking of his role as Buffalo Bill in <i>Silence of the Lambs</i>. But he nails this role — he knows exactly what he's doing.

John's kooky brother-in-law, Mark, is so funny.

Robert Englund's Mr. Gartley is grotesque and over-the-top. He forces his niece to bathe in front of him — very upsetting.

The movie fumbles around a little, but by the third act, it kicks up the insanity.

I don't love this movie as much as some Tobe Hooper fans. But I had fun and got many laughs from this.
