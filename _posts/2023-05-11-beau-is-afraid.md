During the pandemic, I read Charlie Kaufman’s book Antkind. Initially, I was into the mixed-up world he established, where everything was out to get him, and he was constantly misunderstood. But then, as the book progressed, Kaufman grew tired of that and changed the scenery, and he did that over and over again for 720 pages

It was reading this book that I realized how desperately Kaufman needs an editor or a second person in the room to get him to somewhere focused and compelling for anyone other than boys who put women in two buckets: mommy or bitch

I’ve always given points for audacity in filmmaking, even if it leaves me cold. I think I’m ready to cut that chain and just let shit be shit

Parker Posey deserves the world, though
