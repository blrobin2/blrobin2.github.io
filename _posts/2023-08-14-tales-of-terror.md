Three tales based on Poe stories — a daughter returns after years to find her father still living with her mother's dead body — a lush who makes his wife miserable may lose her to another man — a dying man uses mesmerism to communicate from the dead

I know Peter Lorre more from Looney Tunes impressions than his acting career. His segment is amusing — there's a Fraiser episode that it must have influenced— but it is the weakest of the three by a long shot

Vincent Price is perfect — his wine-tasting face is so funny

My biggest complaint is just that the shortness of the stories doesn't make much room for lingering dread, but it's all enjoyable stuff
