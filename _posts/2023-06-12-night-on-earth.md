Just what I needed — chill Jarmuch vibes, great little vignettes, room to breathe in the dialogue to let the landscape melt into the scene

Wynona Rider and Gena Rowlands scene is fantastic, I love both of them
— “Guys, can’t live with em, can’t shoot ‘em”
— “I’m sorry I sound calm, I assure you I am hysterical”

Young Giancarlo Esposito! I haven’t seen him this energetic and funny before. Armin Mueller-Stahl is an adorable, out-of-his-element German clown. No one delivers a “fuck you” like Rosie Perez

Two French dudes ragging on Isaach De Bankolé for being bad at driving — blind because he’s Ivorian? Not a joke I’d understand — but then he pics up Beatrice Dalle, whose character is blind but knows where he is on the road. It’s nice to see her in something that isn’t fucked up

Roberto Benigni being a goddamn weirdo, Paolo Bonacelli being cold and off-putting, no surprises there. This is the worst segment, Benigni is exhausting

I don’t know any Finnish actors offhand, but I guess all these dudes have been in award-winning Finnish movies — neat! Big Eastern Bloc vibes. It's sad but well-conceived

Overall, nothing is outstanding, but everything is good (except for the Rome segment)
