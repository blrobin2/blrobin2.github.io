- Basil Rathbone with pesto please
- I guess you can be too thin
- I am furious (yellow)
- He's no ordinary animal, he's your father
- Seven swords for seven brothers, seven curses for seven brothers
- oh my braces, owie

I kind of like this! It's not the most interesting story, snd the acting is unremarkable, but some of the effects and set pieces are neat â€” the dragon looks cool as hell
