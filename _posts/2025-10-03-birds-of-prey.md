**Rating:** 1.5/5

This movie is almost exclusively bird attack scenes. There is a whisper of plot for a minute or two, but I've already forgotten what it is beyond, "Birds are attacking us... Why?"

The eyeball attacks are pretty gross-looking, despite also looking cheap. They actually kill a lot of birds in this movie, itâ€™s depressing :(

Thank you, Wikipedia, for listing <i>The Birds</i> under 'See Also'.

Flamingos are such dinosaurs!!

* A bird screeches. Two lovers kiss at sunset in Acapulco. More birds hanging outside a strip mall.
* DaVinci dreamed of men soaring in khakis.
* When your dad directed <i>Zindy, the Swamp Boy</i>, you can write your own ticket in Hollywood.
* I tawt I taw a tabernacle!
* That's super, daddy! Almost makes you want to get your eyeball ripped out of your skull!
* Please don't.
* I'm going out to punch birds.
* I'm just a simple birthday nurse, leave me out of this!
* I forgot! We have 10,000 cats in the basement! (Mike referring to another Rene Cardona Jr. movie, <a href="https://boxd.it/8KfbVZ" rel="nofollow"><i>Night of a Thousand Cats</i></a><i></i>).
