Patrick closes his eyes. In his hand is a vial. He sips from his mug as thunder strikes and rain pours. Along the roof of his trailer, the rain crawls.

Pounding on the door — a barefoot woman stands in the rain, asking for a ride into town. He offers her a towel and tells her his car doesn't work.

She looks for a way to call a cab, but Patrick insists she removes her shirt so he can dry it.

Finally, he gives her some coins for the pay phone at the other end of the car park. When the storm lets up, he'll take her.

I'm a big fan of a movie that gives you almost nothing at the start and lets the story unfold.

Unfortunately, the movie's ending is obvious by about 20 minutes in.

That's not a huge problem — how it happens is what's most interesting anyway.

And it stays interesting for a while. But by the time the third act rolls around, it's a bit of a grind.
