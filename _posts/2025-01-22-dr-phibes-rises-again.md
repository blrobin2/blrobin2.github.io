We get a recap of Dr. Phibes's deal (dead wife, revenge, etc). He joins his wife, Victoria, in suspended animation until the Moon enters alignment with the planets.

Three years later, Dr. Phibes arises and gives a glorious speech detailing his plans to take Victoria to the River of Life in Egypt, where they both will receive eternal life. Phibes summons his assistant, Vulnavia, to retrieve the ancient map, only to discover that his home has been destroyed and his safe emptied.

The culprit is a mysterious and wealthy man named Darius Biederbeck. He has his intentions for the map and its destination. Phibes may be able to retrieve the map, but that won't stop Biederbeck from pursuing him.

This film has much of the theatrics from <i>The Abominable Dr. Phibes</i>. The kills are over-the-top, at least in their setup. Often, the final kill is underwhelming compared to the elaborate setup.

The humor is more pronounced, leaning into the silliness of the whole setup. The detectives hunting down Phibes engage in all sorts of wordplay and misunderstandings.

This movie was around when Vincent Price started poisoning his well by asking for more money and disavowing himself from AIP, leading to him getting fewer acting roles. His career never stopped until his final role in Edward Scissorhands, but the quality of the films he acted in was spottier.

Still, this is a fun movie that never takes itself too seriously. It has plenty of cartoony set pieces and jokes.
