<blockquote><i>Gamera the flying turtle is pretty neat I must admit, but 2 weeks in a row is ridiculous.</i> â€” A call from a viewer</blockquote>
This is the episode that introduces Dr. Clayton Forester and Dr. Lawrence Erhardt, at least in picture form. Joel commits to the bit that they can't control what movies they watch. To further emphasize the torture, they watch yet another Gamera.

A kid calls in and asks if Joel and the robots could come to his birthday party ðŸ˜­ They put up a birthday banner for the kid and apologize for being unable to make it, what with being stranded in space and all

Joel and Tom Servo riff this one, since they froze Crow by accident. Joel modifies Servo's voice from high and squeaky to somewhat like he sounds in the show.

I was too hard on this movie last time. The Gyaos opening rules.

- That's gotta hurt â€” I don't care what your background is
- That's where I draw the line â€” that's just impossible
