No Doubt's Just a Girl erupts over scrapbook patterns and photos. We step into a picture of Venice Beach, through a polka dot curtain, and into Romy and Michele's apartment, where they watch <i>Pretty Woman</i> for the like, 36th time. Ironically, of course.

They get dressed in the most amazing 90s club outfits, just like they do every night. At the club, Be My Lover pulses. They scan the club for cute boys but concede to dance with themselves. When Romy wishes she were lesbian, Michelle offers to have sex with her so they can make sure they're not. Romy declines, telling her to ask again when she's 30.

Romy works at a Jaguar dealership. Heather Mooney from Sagebrush High in Tucson walks in. Despite being uninterested in talking to Romy, Heather asks if Romy is going to the 10-year high school reunion. Romy didn't know about it. At the mention of Michele, Heather breaks down, remembering that Michele dated Sandy, whom Heather was in love with.

Romy and Michele reminisce about high school, looking through their yearbook. They realize they weren't exactly popular or in any particular social group. They were the butt of many popular kid jokes. So, feeling hotter than ever, they decide to go to the reunion and blow everyone away. Of course, that would require lying about careers and boyfriends and everything.

There are so many hot people in this movie. Justin Theroux in a cowboy hat, Janeane Garofalo, Mira Sorvino, Alan Cumming in his straightest role, and on and on.

Robin Schiff's script knows that Lisa Kudrow and Mira Sorvino are the movie, so the plot is little more than a frame to attach funny bits. They're both so funny. There are so many one-liners I had to pause and laugh for.

Some favorites:

- Can you excuse me? I cut my foot before, and my shoe is filling up with blood.
- Do you have any businesswomen specials?
- You know what? I bet everyone made someone else's life hell in high school.
- See, I told you it would pay off to go to those clubs every night.

I love love love the color! Romy and Michele's outfits are outstanding, and they have a new one in every scene. It feels like a Deee-Lite music video.

The songs are choice, and Steve Bartek's score goes some surprising places — his work with Danny Elfman comes through in spots.

This movie is so cozy! Add it to the list of sick-day movies.
