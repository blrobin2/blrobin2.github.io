**Rating:** 4/5

Here it is — the last episode of the original MST3K run. While I'm sad to see it end — the last scene made me tear up — it was also time. The show bounced back a few times when it jumped to Sci-Fi, but the magic was waning, and the movie choices were more questionable.

Still, this has been one of the most rewarding film experiences of my life. I've learned a million ways to tease out the nuances in a bad movie that take it from "unfortunate" to "unforgivable." It's helped me appreciate other movies more, where I can celebrate the small victories in an otherwise misguided affair, as well as revel in the weird choices that seemingly standard pictures make.

I'm a movie lover, good or bad, and <i>MST3K</i> has been my gateway drug. I'll be revisiting these movies for years to come.

I love this movie! It has one of my favorite Ennio Morricone themes. The style is a perfect heightening of Bond and Batman aesthetics. I want to inject this movie into my bloodstream at death so my final dreams look like it.
