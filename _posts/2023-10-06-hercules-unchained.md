- hey, stop feeding my bride!
- there.
- you've been lifting, what's your max?
- jeez, how deeply did he drink from the waters of forgetfulness?
- are we locked in or out?

This movie's fine for a sword-and-sandal — the climax is pretty epic for the budget, so I'm guessing a ton of unpaid Italian boys are falling off the horses and whatnot

I bet a remaster would pop off with some of the color choices — I'd give Mario Bava more credit for how good this looks than for any directing choices

Sylvia Lopez gives a wild performance — it's sad that she died of leukemia the same year this came out

I love that Letterboxd gives Sophocles and Aeschylus writing credits
