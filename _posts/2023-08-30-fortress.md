**Rating:** 3/5

In a future with a one-child policy, John (Christopher Lambert) and Karen (Loryn Locklin) try to sneak across the US border to Canada. Karen is pregnant with their second child. The guards catch John and sentence him to 21 years at The Fortress

The absence of Brian Yuzna's effects is notable, but Paul Gentry (who also did visual effects for The Stuff) does a solid job — lots of body parts blowing up

This movie is Stuart Gordon at his most action-packed that I've seen thus far. It's goofy and gory — throw it on for Boys Night™️

<b>Stray Thoughts</b>
* Christopher Lambert was an early sign that I probably wasn't straight. I couldn't get over his face, and the word "cool" wasn't working
* The warden (Kurtwood Smith) can monitor inmate dreams, so he gets off to John's dreams where he's having sex with his wife and then punishes him for having good dreams
* Penises in the reflection of a guard's sunglasses — cool
* Long-haired weirdo Jeffrey Combs rules — so happy Gordon could find a role for him
