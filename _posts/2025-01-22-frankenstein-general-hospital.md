<blockquote><i>Deep in the subterranean bowels of General Hospital lies the secret laboratory of Dr. Bob Frankenstein</i></blockquote>

Victor Frankenstein's great-great grandson, Bob (Mark Blankfield), picks up the work his ancestor started with the help of his gay little assistant, Iggy (Leslie Jordan). That will be hard since neither has a solid idea of what they're doing.

Meanwhile, a (relatively) conventional hospital runs upstairs. Well, you know, except for all the mysterious deaths.

This movie is so silly. It rides that line of amusing and groan-inducing that I find hard to hate. I could do without the fatbobic stuff, but thankfully, it's not rampant.

Â It has a cast of, um, known actors, including Irwin Keyes as The Monster and Lou Cutell as Dr. Saperstein. Even Bobby Pickett, who wrote The Monster Mash, makes a brief appearance.

Director Deborah Romare (operating under one of her many aliases, Deborah Roberts) has worked alongside several big names as a producer. Between this and [reads card] <i>Patients</i>, however, she didn't make much of an impact as a director.

Yet, here I am, in the year of our lord 2025, watching this dumb comedy! Put yourself in your preferred state of intoxication and give it a whirl.
