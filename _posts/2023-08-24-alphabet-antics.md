**Rating:** /5

* D is for Damned, as in Village of
* B is the bump you get when you fall, and you break your back, neck, pelvis, and all!
* N is for float... huh?
* X is for existential crisis
* Y is for Yanni as far as I'm concerned

How did they manage to make so many fat jokes in such a short time?
