**Rating:** /5

I love it when giallo directors do sci-fi. This is modeled so closely on <i>Star Wars</i>, but without all the stuff. It's so kooky though, I actually love this. 

Joe Spinell as the Darth Vader surrogate!  Caroline Munro as Leia or something! Christopher Plummer as the emperor! So many colors!

* You just don't see upholstery in spaceships anymore
* To heck with Deadpool, you're the next Bugs Bunny
* Space kick revisited!
* I never get tired of that shot. It's a great, great, great shot.
* Mexican bootleg Lisa Simpson??
* I knew it would hurt you and I let it happen
* — By sunset... — In space?
