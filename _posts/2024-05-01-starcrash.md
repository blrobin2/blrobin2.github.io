I love it when giallo directors do sci-fi. This is modeled so closely on <i>Star Wars</i>, but without all the stuff. It's so kooky though, I actually love this.

Joe Spinell as the Darth Vader surrogate! Caroline Munro as Leia or something! Christopher Plummer as the emperor! So many colors!

- To heck with Deadpool, you're the next Bugs Bunny
- Space kick revisited!
- I never get tired of that shot. It's a great, great, great shot.
- Mexican bootleg Lisa Simpson??
- I knew it would hurt you and I let it happen
- — By sunset... — In space?
