<blockquote><i>Down through the ages has rushed a menace more dangerous than the worst criminal. SYPHILIS. Let us seize this monster and stamp out forever its horrible influence. Syphilis must no longer play its deadly part in our lives, preventing marriages… breaking up families… and resulting in innocent offspring born blind, diseased, and maimed… doomed to a life of misery. The subject of syphilis must no longer remain hushed, but must be fought in the open like any other dangerous, contagious disease… humanity must be enlightened! Ignorance must be abolished! Young and old… rich and poor…..</i></blockquote>

Millicent is a reformed burlesque dancer. After winning a beauty contest in her hometown, she travels to New York to become a model. There, she attends a casting call with a couch — you know what I mean — and contracts syphilis.

The film claims to be a warning to the youth about venereal diseases. Like <i>Reefer Madness</i>, however, this framing was a way for director Dwain Esper to portray exploitative subjects — burlesque, lesbianism, premarital sex, rape, and debaucherous parties.

Also, like <i>Reefer Madness</i>, it's a boring curio more than anything. Exploitation fans will appreciate it for historical purposes. Anyone else shouldn't bother.

#### Stray Thoughts \_\*\*</b>

- "Sex Criminal Jailed After Baby Murder."
- I used a couple of clips from this movie for a project in college. No, you can't see it.
- The Hays Code made an exception to taboo subjects if the filmmakers framed it as "educational." It's the same loophole that allows fetish and sexually explicit videos to exist on YouTube.
- Dwain Esper also engaged in satirical takes on educational films such as <i>How to Undress in Front of Your Husband</i>. The short is mostly about watching Elaine Barrie undress but is told from the perspective of a peeping tom trying to inform the public.
- Kino released an audio commentary for <i>Sex Madness</i> with Patton Oswalt and Rob Zabrecky pretending to give a history of the film. I'd love to track it down.
