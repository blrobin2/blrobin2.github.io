**Rating:** 3/5

I’ve been watching <i>Black Sails</i> with some friends, and it’s clear now that the missing element in the show is a sea beast or two

There are some fun set pieces, notably one involving a monster nostril and some rope. Some moments are even beautiful and sway darker than your standard Disney fare — I know this isn’t Disney, but the director came from the studio

Not outstanding, but an easy enough watch if pirate stuff is your deal
