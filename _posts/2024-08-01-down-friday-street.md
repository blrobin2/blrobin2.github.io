**Rating:** /5

Tobe Hooper has two competing interests — to entertain and to challenge. When he leans too hard in one direction, it’s kind of boring. This short feels like b-roll for a cheap horror movie, with all the dizzying zooms and macabre imagery. I like several images, but the collected whole doesn’t do much for me.
