An empty road at night glows red—the traffic light, the cocktail sign, the neon Santa, and the blood on Denise's shirt. She rides the bus alone, her bloodied hands holding herself, trying to hide what is obvious. She pulls a gun.

Carla wakes up in a sweat, pushing herself against her bedroom wall, staring at the door. "She's coming." An airplane takes off. The room shakes violently. The plane crashes, and the dead litter the ground. Denise sits in a detached plane seat in the sand, totally unscathed, the sole survivor. She stares at a man torn in half with his entrails pouring out of him. His eyes open.

The telephone rings. Blake awakens and answers the phone to Carla, who asks the name of the producer she's doing a commercial for. Blake tells her it's Denise. And if she's taking a flight this morning. "Something's going to happen." Carla sees the plane take off. Denise arrives at the hospital. The doctor, Brian, worries she might have survivor's syndrome. Denise can figure out why she didn't get billed for a dress she bought. But she can't figure out how she's still alive.

<blockquote><i>Those computers—they may make a mistake, but they'll find you.</i></blockquote>

While leaving the hospital through the back door, she feels a strange presence. At the docking bay, a girl stands staring at Denise, drenched in water. Denise tries to help the girl when the brakes cut on a delivery truck. It nearly cuts into Denise before she sees it and rolls away to safety. Similar experiences keep happening to Denise. Something is trying to kill Denise.

The film appears to have a decent budget. The acting is solid, especially Anita Skinner, who pulls off traumatized but still horny quite effectively (is that Bette Midler's thing??). The dialogue between Denise and Brian has a playful quality that I found both corny and charming.

This director also did <i>Night of the Comet</i>, which I was a big fan of. He also made a 2000s movie named <i>Ratz</i> about two girls who turn their rats into boys. Of course, it's on my watchlist.

This is often compared to <i>Final Destination</i>, but it also has significant <i>It Follows</i> vibes! And I would say it's at least as good as that movie.


<b>*** Stray Thoughts / Spoilers ***</b>
* I guess this is technically a Christmas movie?
* The nurse regarding the morgue: "What do people think this is, the fun zone?"
* "I should've helped that girl," says Denise. "Forget her!" says Kristy, the most callous person alive.
* I think I might accidentally watch all of Kurt Johnson's filmography. The only one I have left is a James Ivory joint, which I've heard is mid.
* Poor Carla—69 takes on a commercial!
* She took THREE classes in Assertion Training, and making out with Brian was the first time it paid off
* Brave to assume the man standing in the middle of the street is just going to accept you yelling at him.
* I love the idea that Death fucked up and is continuing to fuck up over and over again trying to kill Denise. How is it this hard, when so many people die so often?
* Of course, Brian is every guy in Giallo — totally doesn't believe the lead and mansplains pseudo-science at her.
* One of the few times I've seen a woman throw up in a movie and it not be because she's pregnant.
* "Lots of things happened before you were born." "Like what?"
* The taxi driver looks like present-day Haley Joel Osment.
* The movie really labors to give Brian a chance to find a dead body so he can see it come back to life. AND THEN HE DOESN'T.
* The J cut with the guy's eyes opening and the record scratch is great!
* What an ending!
