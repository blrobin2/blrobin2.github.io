This film is a heart work — it warms and tugs as we experience young friendship, family discord, and the envy that robs of joy. The performances are remarkable, especially Bukky Bakray, who deftly portrays the weight and fear of too many responsibilities for someone her age. Her choices, even when they are frustrating, make sense.

My biggest complaints about the movie are the overuse of montage and the hasty way which some of the dramatic threads close up. That said, this film could have taken some dark avenues that I appreciate it didn't — I've seen enough misery porn about black women.
