Cliff’s wife has committed suicide, and this Christmas, he wants to speak to her. So, he invites friends over to hold a seance. But Cliff doesn’t just want a sign; he wants communication: he wants his wife back

The specter of WWII looms over them — the things they did because they had to do it — the ghosts of a mission that consumed their lives and innocence still haunt

First off, the script is terrible. As executed, there’s probably 20-30 minutes of meaningful dialogue and progression. The second act is full of characters repeating lines word for word to each other in a circle. Perhaps that’s more realistic in some ways, but it’s tedious for the viewer

The actors did pretty well, but you can tell they could only come up with so many ways of saying the same things over and over

Overall, I like the concept of this, but like so many high-concept movies, it doesn’t know how to think through the execution
