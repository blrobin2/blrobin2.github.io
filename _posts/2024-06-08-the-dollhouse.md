Director Kyra Elise Gardner is the daughter of Tony Gardner, who worked on special effects for Chucky. Here, she interviews people who have worked on the movies. They were a second family to her growing up.

Though brief, the short gives a delightful glimpse into the actual folks who worked on the films and continue to work on the Chucky TV show.
