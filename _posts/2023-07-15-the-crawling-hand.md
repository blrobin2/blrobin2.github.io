- Too many years at the Strasberg School
- Tell them I’m smoking!
- 10 seconds until he slaps the table…
- I recognize him, he used to be in Def Leppard
- You spend a hard day loading bodies, and you get one more than you bargained for… it’s Miller time
- That’s when sirens were sirens… and headlights were headlights… and hats were hats
- Nice swoon!
