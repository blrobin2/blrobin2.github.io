**Rating:** 2.5/5

* Too many years at the Strasberg School
* Tell them I’m smoking!
* 10 seconds until he slaps the table…
* I recognize him, he used to be in Def Leppard
* You spend a hard day loading bodies, and you get one more than you bargained for… it’s Miller time
* That’s when sirens were sirens… and headlights were headlights… and hats were hats
* Nice swoon!
