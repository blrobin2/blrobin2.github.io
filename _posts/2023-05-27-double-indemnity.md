A boring insurance salesman (Frederick MacMurray) opts in on helping a hot housewife (Barbara Stanwyck) kill her husband and commit insurance fraud because he’s too horny to say no

In telling his story through flashback, bleeding into an audio recording, we know he loses out on everything. But the fun is in seeing the plan play out and the wrinkles develop

It’s hard to fully appreciate just because it’s so influential and well-known, but the Raymond Chandler dialogue is snappy, the lighting is beautiful, and Stanwyck is a great femme fatale

<b>Stray Thoughts</b>

- Keys talks like Larry David as Mr. Steinbrenner in <i>Seinfeld</i>
- Seeing <i>Body Heat</i> first was a mistake. It’s essentially the same movie —<i> Body Heat</i> has a better ending
