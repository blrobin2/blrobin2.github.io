**Rating:** 2/5

Billy, a rock singer for Rocktoberblood, goes on a killing spree. Only Lynn survives. Billy gets the chair

Two years later, Lynn leads Rocktoberblood as Headmistress, singing Rainbow Eyes — the song Billy wrote for her. But at a concert, Billy returns dressed as Death, telling her to watch out because he's coming for her.

<blockquote><i>I want your hot steaming pussy blood all over my face.</i></blockquote>Everyone tells Lynn she's crazy, but she keeps seeing him. Is Billy back from the dead?

Written and directed by Beverly Sebastian, along with her husband Fred Sebastian, this film feels specially designed for the 80s rock nerd — whenever the plot kicks in, the skin starts to show.

The music sounds decent because the band <i>Sorcery</i> portrayed the band in the movie and composed several of the songs.

The lighting on this is horrendous. The exception is the live performance finale, which has the benefit of stage lighting.

I'm swinging back and forth on whether this is awesomely bad or not. In a few scenes, it is, but several scenes are slow and tedious. And the nudity is so pervy that it's hard to imagine putting together a group of friends who won't feel awkward in the TWO extended nude jacuzzi scenes.
