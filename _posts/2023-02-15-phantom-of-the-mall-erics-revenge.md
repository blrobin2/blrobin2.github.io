Vaguely reminiscent of Chopping Mall at the start — learned after that this is filmed in the same mall from Chopping Mall and a ton of other movies

Pauly Shore talking in his normal voice?!

By trying to be “Phantom of the Opera” but in a mall, the movie has almost no tension. The whole appeal is reduced to the zany kills, which are pretty good and occasionally funny, but few and far between
