Kenneth Magee, a writer, touches down in the UK, meeting up with his publisher, Sam Allyson, for lunch. Kenneth sees a woman across the dining hall. Sam suggests love at first sight, but Kenneth doesn’t believe in such things. Sam pushes Kenneth to develop his talents and branch out into more passionate territory. Kenneth believes anyone could write a novel on par with Wuthering Heights nowadays. So much so that he makes a $20 thousand bet that, given a night in an isolated, atmospheric locale, he could write said novel in 24 hours. Sam suggests the old, abandoned Bllyddpaetwr Manor in Wales.

It’s pronounced bald-patter, but Kenneth and Sam say bald-pate. Hilarity ensues?

Sam drives out to the manor, the stormy weather growing drearier as he draws closer. He pulls up to a Tudor-style Victorian manor with castle-like turrets. The inside is dark and cobwebbed, with sheets covering the furniture, banister, and statues. He sets up shop in a bedroom and works on his novel, Midnight Manor.

As he types, he feels an unease. He lights more candles around the room. At one end, in front of a faded tapestry, he finds a washbowl and pitcher full of water. He pulls back the comforter on the bed and discovers fresh linens on the pillows. Outside, on the floor below, he sees the outline of a figure enter a lit room and close the door. Upon inspection, he finds the manor occupied by Elijah and Victoria Quimby, caretakers for the manor.

Before Kenneth can dig further, another woman shows up — the woman he saw at his hotel. She tells Kenneth that he is in grave danger and must leave with her. She suggests a terrorist organization, but Kenneth doesn’t buy it. He overhears her call Sam, and she mentions the caretakers. But Sam informs her that there are no caretakers.

What the hell is going on? Who are these people? Why are they lying? Will Kenneth finish his novel and win the bet?

The film has a classic horror structure. Perhaps it comes from the 1913 play on which they based this movie. This is the seventh film adaptation, excluding theater, TV, and radio adaptations. So it makes sense that several critics found this adaptation “unnecessary.” I’ve seen none of them, nor has anyone recommended them.

I watched this because Vincent Price, Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing, and Jon Carradine are in it together, and this is the only time they were ever in a movie together. It’s nice to see them, even though they have little to do.

I haven’t seen Desi Arnaz, Jr. in anything — he has a classic charm and handsomeness that make up for his meh acting skills. 

The movie is delightful for Hammer and classic horror fans. It takes an hour before the plot commences, but the atmosphere is satisfying. I wouldn’t venture to watch this unless inclined before my mention of it.
