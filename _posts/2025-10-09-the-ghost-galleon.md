After a photoshoot, swimsuit model Noemi speaks with model agency director Lillian about the whereabouts of Noemi's roommate and fellow model, Kathy. Lillian reluctantly brings Noemi to Howard Tucker, the sporting goods magnate, who tells Noemi that they intentionally stranded Kathy on a boat as part of a publicity stunt with fellow model Lorena.

Kathy reports by radio that they believe they are in a position along the shipping line so that a passing ship will notice them. They cannot be sure, however, because fog envelops them. In the distance, they spot an old Spanish galleon floating toward them. They shoot off their flare, but the boat doesn't seem to react. As it gets closer, they can see no one on the galleon. The galleon collides with the motorboat. Kathy says screw this and boards the galleon while Lorena stays behind. Howard Tucker dispatches a helicopter to rescue the women, but it is unable to locate the motorboat.

For assistance in finding them, Howard and Lillian go to Professor Grüber, who is familiar with the weather in that area, and he assures them that it never gets foggy in that part of the ocean. When Lillian mentions a galleon, the professor assures her that the women will never return. He joins them, hoping for a chance to see this phantom ship himself.

Will Howard and team find Kathy and Lorena in time? What awaits them on the galleon?

Howard Tucker believes that money solves all his problems — it buys trust and confidence, allowing him to do what he wants. So, when Noemi, a staunch anti-capitalist, refuses his money, he resorts to more classical patriarchal modes of subjugation through kidnapping and SA. Similarly, Howard refuses to accept anything that isn't scientific, while ironically, the science professor is the first to believe that what they are experiencing isn't in their dimension of reality.

I like the galleon ghost designs. I haven't seen any of the other <i>Blind Dead</i> movies, so I'm not familiar with how the design compares to those films or if it's the same. I also like the spoopy vibes on the ship. I'm always a sucker for a haunted ship. The gore is whatever—if you care, you might be annoyed, but I found it good enough.

If you're not a horror fan, you might find this movie a little slow. While I don't think it necessarily makes the best use of its time, I believe the film builds effective tension through its patient unveiling. Still, this one is for the diehards.
