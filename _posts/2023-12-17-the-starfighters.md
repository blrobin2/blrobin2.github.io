**Rating:** 1/5

No one wanted to do this movie except Frank Conniff â€” if you ever ask yourself why they do a movie as bad as this, it's almost always Frank's fault.

According to Frank, the only reason they did this movie was that they were desperate, and all of the other options were somehow worse.

I submit my single joke: Only Angels Have Plot

* There's already too much flying in this movie
* Bob Dornan: Wild at Heart
* This plane is insatiable!
* And as the seasons change, the refueling continues
*  We spent billions so the Air Force could mess around. Yes, we traded the education of millions of kids for these planes
* This plane was recently sexed. It's a boy
* Wheels! What doesn't this movie have?
* Do you know that flying a plane is like making love: you have to pay
* I know I'm supposed to feel something but I don't
