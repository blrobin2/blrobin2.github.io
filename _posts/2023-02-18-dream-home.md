**Rating:** 2/5

Lit at times like a Wong Kar-wai film, flipping wildly between warm slice of life flashbacks and icy green splatter flick murders, I kept waiting for the moment where the two stories merged. But the brutality of the murders — and the intended comedy behind some of them — do not line up with the motivations of the character we’ve been introduced to. It feels like two different movies cut and paste together

If it matters, the gore effects are well done and super indulgent, so if you just want some torture porn, you can zone out during the flashbacks. If you want a critique on skyrocketing property values and the subprime mortgage crisis, you might need to look elsewhere
