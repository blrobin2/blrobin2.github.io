**Rating:** 3/5

The messaging is as unsubtle as possible, especially once the father finds the woman he brings home to tame — for example, when he sticks his hand in her mouth, she bites off his ring finger and spits out his wedding ring; he replies by punching her and telling her “that’s not civilized behavior” — when the mother asks if they should be doing this, he smacks her across the face and tells her that it’s time to go to bed

When his son sneaks down to… the father says “boys will be boys”, just in case you’ve missed the first hour

For the subject matter, it has to be brutal and uncomfortable — anything less would devolve into pornography. That said, by the third act, the movie makes some choices that undercut the messaging in favor of an extreme ending

Overall, a real fucked up movie! I appreciate the intent more than the resulting product, but it has its moments
