This movie grew on me this time around! I've watched some boring-ass Godzillas, and this one is quite cuckoo.

The Orville Popcorn skit initially used Orville Redenbacher's name, but they changed it to avoid a lawsuit. They made the name change without consulting their lawyer, who told them after the fact that the name change did not, in fact, change the likelihood of them receiving a lawsuit.
