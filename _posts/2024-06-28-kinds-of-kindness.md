**Rating:** 3.5/5

With <i>Poor Things</i>, Yorgos Lanthimos displayed a more mature approach to his misanthropy. Here, he indicates that the maturity we saw was perhaps an accidental fluke more than an intentional choice. He's still the guy who made <i>The Lobster</i>, and all his classic proclivities are here: awkward sex, animal mutilation/death, deadpan acting, and sadomasochism.


<b>The Death of R.M.F. ****</b>
Robert follows his boss, Raymond, in every order. But when Raymond asks him to do something that puts another life in jeopardy, he says no for the first time. He finds out what that costs.

This one had me invested! I was sad to see it end. The other stories could have merged with this and made an enjoyable full-length. Still, it isn't lacking, and I liked it the most.


<b>R.M.F. is Flying ***</b>
Daniel's wife, Liz, went missing on a marine biologist expedition. She returns, but she seems off. Daniel suspects she might not be his wife.

This one is a bit of a mess. It has a few threads, and none of them coalesce. I liked aspects of it, but this one is the most upsetting by a mile.


<b>R.M.F. Eats a Sandwich ***.5</b>
Emily and Andrew are looking for a woman with very specific attributes, including the ability to bring back the dead. Emily misses her husband, Joseph, and daughter and secretly visits their house when they aren't there. But when they come back early, Emily's life changes.

I liked a lot of this one! It probably has the most complete arc out of the three. I was getting a little tired by then. So I might like it more when I can watch it before bedtime.
