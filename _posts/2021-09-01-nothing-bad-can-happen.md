Joke review:

So this is what would’ve happened if Bobby Hill kept hanging out with those Christian skate punks!

Honest review:

CW: child abuse, rape, torture, animal cruelty

This movie can either be viewed as persecution porn, and what some Christians think all non-believing families are like; or it can be seen as a red flag (or flags) for those who believe they must endure abuse or cruelty in the name of faith

The fact that you cannot be sure which is the film’s intended message can be seen as a weakness. I appreciate the director’s desire to leave the tension unresolved, despite the messiness it leaves in the movie

That said, this was not a pleasant watch, and I don’t think I would recommend it to horror fans or most people. It resonated with parts of my past (not the torture, don’t worry) and I think the performances ultimately elevate the material. I’ll probably never watch it again
