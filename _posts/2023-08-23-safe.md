**Rating:** 5/5

<b>San Fernando Valley, 1987</b>

Carol is a bored, rich housewife who suddenly becomes ill, and no doctor or psychiatrist can determine why

<blockquote><i>Environmental Illness: Are You Allergic to the 20th Century?</i></blockquote>All in white and pastel, accosted by black couches, black trucks unloading black fumes, black gangs invading the city

<blockquote><i>Dad, how do you spell "uzi"?</i></blockquote>She's safe as houses in a gated mansion: safe from harm, safe from herself and her hate. Walking the garden at night, she holds a wilted rose — a spotlight on her, security detail for the neighborhood

<blockquote><i>I found the whole 12-step thing just another form of addiction</i></blockquote>Julianne Moore is incredible in this — forever underrated

There are so many good overheard lines, but one of my favorites is a woman talking about her young son's seemingly psychosomatic illness. "He can't go into Chunky Cheese anymore! Why would he do that to himself?"

Funny, unnerving, cruel, beautiful — I love this movie, and I barely understand it. I'm going to spending a lot of time thinking about this one
