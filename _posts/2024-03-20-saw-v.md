Where did the budget go? This movie has none of the visual flair that the previous ones had. The style was silly, but at least it was a choice.

If you didn't like the previous movies, you won't like this one â€” it's a lot of flashbacks and previous movie footage. I'm so bored with this continuity!

Why did they hire two identical actors? They should have let Costas Mandylor talk in his Australian accent. Then, we would have some way to differentiate them.

A production designer directing the movie might have helped clarify what the traps do. I enjoyed the five-person trap sequences. It's the rest of the experience that blows.

I want to be fun and like these :(
