<b><a href="https://boxd.it/r6gwI">Bond, Ranked Bond: The Cold War’s Horniest Spy</a></b>

To survive family Christmas, I have been macro-dosing sangria, so we’ll see how coherent these notes are.

#### Stray Thoughts/Spoilers

- “This never happened to the other fellow.” Lazy lamp shading.
- Tracy di Vicenzo. Is she the best Bond girl? Every time she shows up, she owns the scene.
- Ahh, gotta beat up Tracy a bit to believe her.
- The sweeper whistling the Goldfinger theme is lame.
- “What she needs is a man to dominate her,” says Tracy’s father about Tracy.
- “The world is not enough,” is the Bond family coat-of-arms motto.
- BLOFELD DOESN’T RECOGNIZE JAMES BOND??
- Bond drops his kilt. Ruby titters. “It’s true!”
- We watched that dummy fall into the crevasse for so long! It’s fake arms waving in the wind.
- The horses look away in horror as Tracy and Bond fuck in the barn.
- “He had lots of guts,” says Bond as a snow machine obliterates one of Blofeld’s goons.
- Chekov’s wall spikes
- Ahh, this movie influenced the snow scene in <i>Inception</i>.
- A bobsled chase was not on my bingo board!
- Dropping a grenade in your bobsled is some <i>Looney Tunes</i> behavior
- The St. Bernard immediately wanting to play instead of help is delightful
- I knew the ending was coming, and it still hit me.
