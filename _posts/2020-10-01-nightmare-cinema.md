The Thing in the Woods: cartoonish sound design, I genuinely couldn’t tell if it was supposed to be funny until 12-13 minutes in... or at least that’s when I laughed. 1/5

Mirari: bad dialogue clearly no women were involved or consulted on the writing, no one’s motivations make sense, but at least it has a perspective. 1.5/5

Mashit: Clearly this director thinks in video game cutscenes, the camera is all over the place and nothing seems connected. I appreciate the idea and the director having fun with it, even if the execution doesn’t really work. 2.5/5

The Way to Egress: Suddenly, the caliber of this whole project amps up and we get an honest-to-god story. Weird, tense, stylish. 4/5

Dead: A little slow and cheesy, not too many surprises here. Once again, nonsense motives. There’s a moment when people are arguing through golden clouds in heaven that made me laugh. 2/5

In-between: Mickey Rourke’s outfit squeaks, and his face is so plastic that it’s hard not to feel like it’s his skin that makes the squeaking sound. Favorite lines of his (because they made me laugh)
- “Welcome to my nightmare”
- “Run! Go, you little motherfucker!”

Overall: I appreciate the effort all around, but I would only recommend one of the shorts and it’s on YouTube, so don’t bother
