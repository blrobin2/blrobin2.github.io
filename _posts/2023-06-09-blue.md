**Rating:** 5/5

A blue screen sets the stage for a surreal audio exploration of the director’s experience with dying of AIDS. Stories range from the mythical to the all-too-real, all themed around the color blue, beautifully rendered in a soundscape of Buddhist chimes, Greek choruses, and ambiance

A film with more layers than I could parse the first time through. It will require repeat listens — maybe not too soon — it’s a rough experience
