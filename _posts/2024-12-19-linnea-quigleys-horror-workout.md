Pink, french-manicured hands cuffed with dozens of sparkling bracelets turn the shower on. As the bleach-blonde hair comes into view, we see our hero, Linnea Quigley, lathering herself up. We watch prolonged shots of her boobs and ass as the credits roll.

<blockquote><i>Hi, I'm Linnea Quigley. I'm usually the girl impaled on antlers or eaten by zombies in the movies.</i></blockquote>

Linnea talks about her career and we watch extended clips from the various movies she's been in. She then goes through a "routine" — more PG ogling than anything.

The whole thing has a budget — there's a chase scene with a dozen decent-looking zombies — but it's not a movie.

<blockquote><i>What about what you do when you watch my movies — you think that doesn't burn any calories?</i></blockquote>

As a cultural object, it's pretty singular, so I don't know how I would rate this. But I can advise anyone who isn't a diehard 80s horror fan to skip this one.
