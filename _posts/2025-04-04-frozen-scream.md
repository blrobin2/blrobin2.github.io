Rifftrax are cowards. They keep all the gore and self-harm but censor the nudity.

Renee Harmon wrote, directed, and starred in this. It's hard to tell where technical limitations end and odd choices begin, and the film's quality doesn't depend on the answer to that question. I can't say I enjoyed it, but I appreciate some of its weirdness. The score is quite delightful.

- — Immortality. Who would want it in a world like this? — What?? Because you could live to the year 6969 and say nice. I thought that was common knowledge.
- I told them you have the Pep Boys tattooed on your back, and they don't believe me, Ann.
- It seems we brought the wrong flavor of Fanta. Will the ritual still work?
- I wonder if keeping a picture of your dead lover is pagan?
- When the rats recovered, their personalities were altered, diffused, almost soulless. They no longer told jokes or played their beautiful chamber music together.
- — Hello? Anne, I'm cold. Help me. I'm so cold. — When you get an obscene phone call from Fairbanks, Alaska
- This weird, tiny lake knows when you're lying, so be honest.
- Jack Around the Shack (to the tune of Rock Around the Clock)
- She's making the face women in yogurt commercials make after eating yogurt.
- Niles will never forgive Fraiser for getting him into this mess!
- Oh, her name's Anne?
