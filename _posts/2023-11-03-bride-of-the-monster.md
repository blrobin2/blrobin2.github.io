**Rating:** 2/5

Bela Legosi crushes it! This is far from Ed Wood's worst. It's not good, but I could follow what was happening for the most part

* I wonder where she's registered?
* Wipe your feet, Tor
* I got water in my galoshes!
* Embrace death, Roy
* Kiss the bird, professor
* This is Motel 666, you get it?
* Hello! Ancillary character waiting to be killed off!
