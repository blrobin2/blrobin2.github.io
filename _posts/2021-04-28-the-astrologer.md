**Rating:** /5

Another awesomely bad late night film a la The Room or Fateful Findings, except with the budget for an actual cinematographer, a number of exotic settings, and halfway decent score and soundtrack

It starts off kind of slow and goofy but it really ramps up the insanity by the end, highly recommended
