A woman chained to a pentagram. A hooded and cloaked man, the executioner of an inquisition, performs a ritual in which Satan impregnates her with his son.

The other monks catch him and torture him on the rack for making a pact with the devil. He claims Satan is the true power, so a priest axes him in the chest. The man claims that when his axe is retrieved, he will return at full power.

Cut to the present day, some teens go camping near a graveyard that robbers have snuck into. They're looking for a grave with tons of gold. They dig it up and see nothing, but their psychic is sure, so she jumps in and falls through a trapdoor

They find jewels, but she gets bad vibes about a crypt. But the dude doesn't care. Inside is the executioner. The kids remove the axe. A strange wind blows through the underground chambers. It starts to rain outside.

The body rises from the crypt, and it wants its axe back.

The gore is pretty effective for a low-budget production.

The soundtrack rules — cheap synth grooves to run from monsters to.

This isn't amazing, but it's plenty of fun. To anyone who says this is a generic slasher — what the hell are you talking about?

<b>*** Stray Thoughts / Spoilers ***</b>
* Running around with her hand cut off, the wound just shooting blood everywhere
* The machine gun isn't allowed in the slasher rules. Of course, it's ineffective against the living dead
* The hand through the chest to get the chain back
* And coking through the wall!
* I love that the cops instantly go to the priest like, "This is some devil shit"
* The dude ends up looking like a <i>Buffy</i> baddie
