<blockquote><i>That's the point; the guy I dreamed up doesn't exist. And if he doesn't exist, I'll never die of a broken heart</i></blockquote>Sisters are witches whose bloodline is cursed such that if they fall in love, the person with whom they fall in love will die

I love the aesthetic, and it's mostly a pretty lighthearted affair. Well, except for when they accidentally kill a guy

The movie has an exquisite corpse of a script, just so many thoughts hacked together — I'm not sure if all three writers were ever in the same room

That said, this movie gets a surprising amount of mileage from Sandra Bullock and Nichole Kidman's charm and chemistry. Did they ever work on anything else together? I haven't found anything

A perfect lazy weekend, "put something on while doing chore" kind of movie

<b>stray thoughts</b>
* 90s movie soundtracks are so saccharine
* the use of "this kiss" works for me, and it shouldn't
* the driving sequence to "a case of You" is so surreal — the way daylight shifts through the scene
* The dude says "my wife," like Borat
* don't fall in love with a cop! come on
