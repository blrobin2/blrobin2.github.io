**Rating:** /5

Letterboxd categorizes this as horror. I agree.

* Ah, snowmen, one of my top 10 things I like to pretend is Parson Brown.
* In our attempt to create life, we have only condemned ourselves to death!
* His disturbingly realistic hands are made for fish-squeezing.
* Now we've got penguin church â€” this short is bringing up a lot of big concepts.
