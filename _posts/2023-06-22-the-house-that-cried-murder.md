**Rating:** 3.5/5

Barbara seduces her father to allow her to build her dream home “For the first time in my useless life, I finally accomplished something!” (Ugh, brag!) She and David are to be married and move into the house together

But of course, on their wedding day, David’s ex, Ellen, shows up, so he hooks up with her. Barbara catches them in the act and swears revenge

This movie has so many names — I had such a hard time finding it. There’s a <i>The Bride</i> that’s also from 1973, but it’s a Turkish film. The title here, <i>The House That Cried Murder,</i> fetched no results. I ended up finding it on Tubi under the title <i>Last House on Massacre Street</i>

The script is pretty unique — so many little one-off lines that are funny and weird. The movie sets up like a classic revenge flick, but Barbara isn’t in the majority of the movie. David and Ellen are more tormented by the idea of her until the finale reveals all

The soundtrack rules — it’s either the cheeriest pop music or the most brooding organ music — it works for me

I did not expect to enjoy this as much as I did, but I had a blast


<b>Stray Thoughts</b>
* The opening track is catchy as hell, <i>bah bah-bah-bah bahh</i>
* Insane house — it looks like its covered in shingles
* The father is Rip Torn reincarnated 
* “I’m a deeply committed atheist!” a wedding guest says apropos of nothing 
* I love the dream sequence where he’s sweaty and walking around her house
* How do you one-up a horsehead in bed? Why, a rooster head, of course
