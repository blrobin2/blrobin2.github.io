Sarge believes enemy soldiers are on the horizon. Sam sits with him, unsure of what is happening. Nurse Janie calls Sam to dinner, assuring him no one has seen the enemy. She also visits Harriet, asking her to leave behind her doll, whom she believes is her baby. Janie mistakenly touches Harriet's baby, which causes Harriet to threaten to kill her. The threat shakes Janie. She returns to Sam to say goodbyeâ€”she cannot take her post anymore. Jennifer wanders by, dead-eyed. Danny, one of the other patients, runs into Harriet's room and steals her baby, sending her into a frenzy.

Outside, Dr. Stephens works with Judge, encouraging him to chop wood. Janie comes out to reveal her plan to leave. Judge strikes Stephens in the back with the axe, killing him. He raises it to attack Janie, but Dr. Geraldine Masters stops it. She vows to finish the work that Dr. Stephens started. Someone sneaks into Harriet's room and takes the babyâ€¦ again. They leave it in Janie's room, convincing Harriet that Janie took it. So, she strangles Janie and smashes her head with a suitcase.

Soon, Charlotte Beale joins the only living doctor, Dr. Masters. Unbeknownst to Masters, Stephens hired Beale a week before. Masters is reluctant to hire someone, especially when she plans on changing how the place is run. Masters gives a long rundown of every patient and their pattern. But don't think the murders haven't stoppedâ€”the movie just takes an eternity to get there.

Conceptually, this movie is standard psych ward schlock. But the plotting is so convoluted that it's hard to tell how good the performances are. It feels like the actors are trying to make it all work but are struggling. I mean, the depictions of insanity are trash. But sometimes, the movie approaches something surreal that I kind of enjoy.

With a Z-grade budget, the movie looks like a made-for-TV movie from the era. The gore is suitable for the styleâ€”cheap but effective. And don't worry, there's a handful of superfluous nudity. You pervert.

This movie isn't for everyone's tastesâ€”it kind of sucks. But I'm so captivated by it?? Also, as others have said, this movie doesn't belong on the Video Nasties list.

<b>**_ Stray Thoughts / Spoilers _**</b>

- Dr. Masters is another one of the patients, isn't she? Or the woman pretending to be Dr. Masters. She gets so weirdly bent out of shape.
- The phone guy is sassy as hell â€” I kind of dig it.
- I hate how much I relate to Allyson.
- The lack of locks on the door is wild. That's another reason I think Masters is a patientâ€”of course, she lives on that floor, but the doctors shouldn't live in the same space, right? Or am I giving this movie too much credit?
- Man, I'm so good. ðŸ˜Ž Or it was obvious, I don't know.
- Charlotte being a patient too isâ€¦ hmmâ€¦
- The closing credits over all the dead bodies are inspired.
