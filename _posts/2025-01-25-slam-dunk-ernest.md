**Rating:** /5

Neal put this on at 1:30AM, and I got to where Kareem Abdul-Jabbar gave Ernest the fancy shoes before calling it

<i>Addendum: 2:30PM</i>
Watching an Ernest movie in 2025 is like intentionally barrel-aging milk. Like, this is what you asked for. I'm not sure how you thought this would taste.
