Trelkovsky looks at a new apartment. The previous tenant, Simone, threw herself out of the window and in critical condition.

Before taking it, Trelkovsky goes to visit Simone in the hospital. There, he meets Stella, a friend of Simone's. He lies about being Simone's friend, so Stella confides in him. After feeling up Stella at the movie theater, he calls the hospital to learn that Simone is dead.

He takes the apartment. His loud friends and total disregard for the other tenants leave him paranoid that the building is out to get him. But he's just an asshole who sees himself as a victim.

Roman Polanski is an awful actor. I don't understand why he cast himself in the lead.

The conceit doesn't justify the movie's length. This could have worked in an Amicus anthology. The movie is about as clever and competently constructed as one.

Isabelle Adjani is a gem, so an extra half-star is for her.
