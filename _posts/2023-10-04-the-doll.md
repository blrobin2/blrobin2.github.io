A woman has more than a few troubles — her mother is in the hospital but cannot afford treatment, her boss is consistently touching and assaulting her, and she is close to losing her apartment due to a lack of payments

After visiting her mother in the hospital, she buys a weird doll from a creepy man. Later, at home, she swipes her cup on the table, shattering it and accidentally cutting herself and bleeding on the doll. The doll comes alive and offers her wishes in exchange for blood

First, she asks for money — not familiar with monkey paw wishes. The next day, a cement truck crashes into her bus — when she comes to, she sees a dead man on the bus with an open bag full of money

Not learning anything, she continues to use it to varying degrees of consequences

This movie has solid special effects! Otherwise, it doesn't have a whole lot going for it, but I appreciated the effort
