<b><a href="https://boxd.it/qBmUY/detail" rel="nofollow">Anti-Criterion Challenge 2024 | 28/52 | That same director’s lowest-rated film (Ang Lee)</a></b>

<b>Liège, Belgium</b>
Henry Brogan is a 51-year-old sniper who works for the DIA. He’s in Belgium to assassinate a terrorist aboard a train. Everything goes smoothly until a young girl approaches the target. Because of the wait, Henry hits the target in the neck — still lethal, but not his intent. His spotter captures it on his phone, which disgusts Henry.

<b>Buttermilk Sound, Georgia, USA</b>
Henry meets with colleague Del Patterson at Henry’s home, announcing his retirement after the “sloppy” shot. He rents a boat from a new manager named Danny. He takes a boat out to meet with Jack on his yacht. Jack shows Henry information that suggests his target in Belgium was innocent. Henry demands a meeting with the informant and chastises Jack for contacting him.

Of course, the DIA is keeping tabs on Henry, and they capture the conversation with a satellite. Or, you know, Jack’s in on it. Either way, the agency director declares Henry a rogue. Clay Verris, a private military contractor, demands they use Gemini since no one else can take out Henry. The director denies him the opportunity.

On his way back, Henry finds a bug on his boat. The only one who could have put it there is Danny, though she denies it. That is until he produces her credentials. They bond until Henry realizes assassins have killed Jack and Henry’s spotter. He grabs Danny and they escape.

It looks like Gemini is on the table, after all. Clay sends out his top assassin. And he bears an uncanny resemblance to Henry.

I watched the 60 FPS version since people seem to like it. It seems to hide the seams of the de-aging work okay — the CGI stunts: not so much. But I watch movies with shitty FX all the time, so I don’t care. It looks like they did some de-aging or something to Clive Owen — he looks indeterminately uncanny valley.

Mary Elizabeth Winstead is a total badass who saves this movie. Will Smith does everything possible to turn off the charisma that made him famous. I suppose the younger self is flat to make the de-aging easier, but as his older self, it’s frustrating.

The action sequences are okay, playing closer to silly fun over grounded. The goopy, stretchy fight sequences between the Wills resemble Neo vs. the 1000s of Agent Smiths.

The film explores similar themes to <i>Civil War</i> — the remorse of the old guard vs. the thirst of the new. It feels like Ang Lee is contemplating what will replace him. Since <i>Life of Pi</i>, Ang Lee has prioritized tech over the story, and his movies have suffered.

I can’t play contrarian and act like this is secretly brilliant. Some folks praise any movie that takes a creative risk because they want to encourage Hollywood to take chances. It’s hard to call an action movie starring Will Smith a chance as much as déjà vu.

It’s a fun, dumb action movie. The rest is noise.
