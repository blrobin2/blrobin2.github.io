A guy wants to bring back The Old Ones, even though it's, you know, a bad idea

The visuals in this are so trippy and striking — the posterized sequences are successful at conveying that bleeding of reality that comes with contact with The Old Ones

Unfortunately, the visuals are the only reason to watch this. The story is tedious, and no one is on their acting game — even veteran Ed Begley is phoning it in for this; I assumed Dean Stockwell is doing his best, but he's always been pretty meh (don't come at me <i>Quantum Leap</i>ers<i>)</i> — and at 87 minutes, the movie is still too long for the story

Just get high and watch it — that's probably the filmmakers' intention
