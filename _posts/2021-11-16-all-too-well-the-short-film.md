I held off on this until I was feeling emotionally ready for it… and I still wasn’t. Taylor Swift knows that the tiny moments are where the heartbreak lives strongest. Also, she pulled an amazing performance out of Sadie Sink

Is this cheesy? Of course. But does it feel honest? Absolutely, and that makes a world of difference
