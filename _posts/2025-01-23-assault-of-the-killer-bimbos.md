<blockquote><i>If there is such a thing as karma, we're in big trouble, guys!</i></blockquote>

A gangster named Vinnie is plotting the murder of nightclub owner Shifty Joe. Lulu is a waitress at the club who gets a chance to dance but blows it.  Peaches, a top go-go dancer at the club, stands up for Lulu when Shifty Joe calls her a bimbo. The two storm out and quit.

In the chaos, Vinnie pulls off his hit. When Peaches and Lulu hear gunfire, they rush into the office, only for Vinnie to hand off his handgun to them. When the crew comes in, it looks like Peaches and Lulu pulled the hit.

So, in a proto-<i>Thema and Louise</i>, the two hit the road and make their way to Mexico. Along the way, they pick up waitress Darlene, and the three of them watch each other's backs in a world that only sees them as bimbos.

Peaches has the most outrageous pair of sunglasses — one lens is a massive triangle that takes over most of her face, while the other is a typical lens.

The movie uses The New Artistocrats (formerly Knight Time)'s "I've Been Watching You," which is an absolute bop. Here's <a href="https://newaristocrats.bandcamp.com/album/new-aristocrats-featuring-knight-time-ive-been-watching-you-80s-extended-vocal-instrumental-remixes">the best version</a>.

A favorite at the 1988 Cannes Film Festival, I knew I had to include this in my birthday year challenge. It's nothing groundbreaking, but its charm is hard to deny.
