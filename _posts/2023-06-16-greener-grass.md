**Rating:** 3.5/5

I listened to a podcast where the directors talked about <i>Polyester</i>, UCB, and their approach to filmmaking, and it sounded right up my alley

Jill has a new baby, and Lisa cannot get over how adorable it is, so Jill offers Lisa the baby to keep. It doesn’t take long before she regrets her decision

Credits over teeth bedecked with braces and a withering smile. Every adult has braces

The world is oversaturated, scored by chronic soft 80s TV synth. Initially, it feels like <i>Tim & Eric</i>, but as it goes, it develops its absurd world

It also has something to say about parenthood — much of it critiques the way parents measure performance and conformity in their children. It’s the developed perspective and continuity between the absurdity that helps this comedy to stand out

Like all sketch comedy, some scenes work better than others, but it’s consistently funny and enjoyable

<b>Stray Thoughts</b>
* “Oh, we just bonded. I’ve been her mom since she was born.”
* Always delighted to see Mary Holland in anything — she’s so funny
* The kid playing Julian is so good — the lines are funny, but his delivery is perfect
* Beck Bennett’s obsession with drinking pool water should stop being funny at some point, but it isn’t
* <i>Kids with Knives</i> seems like such a rad show
