**Rating:** /5

Oh, I love SOV horror. The plot isn't much, but those kills are fucking gnarly. Also, god bless a low-budget horror movie that doesn't try to compensate with irony-poisoned humor.

* A hidden agenda implies the existence of hidden action items.
* The things you put birdseed in are now in major motion pictures.
* — I hope that don't burn the fucking forest down. — That was Smokey's original catchphrase.
* I hate having spiritual awakenings triggered by the realization we're not alone in the cosmos!
* He's hunting for needlessly specific chyrons.
* C'mon, feeders — eat what you want, but eat what you take!
* It doesn't matter where they're going — they parked in a horrible place.
* I'm so jealous of your white, bubbly stigmata.
