Oh, I love SOV horror. The plot isn't much, but those kills are fucking gnarly. Also, god bless a low-budget horror movie that doesn't try to compensate with irony-poisoned humor.

- A hidden agenda implies the existence of hidden action items.
- The things you put birdseed in are now in major motion pictures.
- — I hope that don't burn the fucking forest down. — That was Smokey's original catchphrase.
- I hate having spiritual awakenings triggered by the realization we're not alone in the cosmos!
- He's hunting for needlessly specific chyrons.
- C'mon, feeders — eat what you want, but eat what you take!
- It doesn't matter where they're going — they parked in a horrible place.
- I'm so jealous of your white, bubbly stigmata.
