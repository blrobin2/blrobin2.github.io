**Rating:** 4/5

* the St. Sebastian statue with glowing eyes that mirrors her mother’s death
* the way the thunder rolls when her mother says “prom??”
* the lighting of the dinner table with the Last Supper tapestry, so that it looks they’re sitting at the table with the disciples

Sissy Spacek is perfect in this movie, I cry for her every time
