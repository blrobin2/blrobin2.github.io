Jigsaw's targets in this film are insurance execs.

<blockquote><i>Everybody thinks we're the bad guys. Nobody mentions the millions of people we help every year without incident, the millions of dollars we donate to charity every year, or all the free clinics we support.</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>These people have no respect for the lives they're destroying. Once you see death up close, then you know what the value of life is.</i></blockquote>

Mark Hoffman is still walking around, having planted evidence that convinced Dan Erickson that Strahm was the Jigsaw helper. But Lindsey Perez is still alive, and neither she nor Dan is done.

The movie-long puzzle is pretty good. The movie gives it more time than the continuity bullshit. Although they also made the continuing story somewhat more interesting.

Not a great movie. Still, it's better than most of the Saw movies thus far.
