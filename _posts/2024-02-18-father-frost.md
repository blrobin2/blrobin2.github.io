**Rating:** 3/5

Jim Mallon's last episode as GPC. I wish this was a Joel episode — it fits his sense of humor more.

I like how this movie looks — supposedly the Czech dub is the best version of the movie. This English dub isn't great but doesn't interfere too much with the experience.

* Arsenic sucker, that ought to do it
* What does a mushroom eat for hallucinations?
* What's the matter? Am I un-BEAR-able?
* That horse is not a real blonde
* I pray for the death of Jack Frost
* I guess this is a magical land. I hate magical lands.
* Hi! Behold a pale horse!
