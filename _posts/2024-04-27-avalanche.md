I despise the NPH / Felicia Day song. I almost pulled an Uzumaki and shoved scissors into my ears. Honest! I really almost did it, I swear to god!

You'd have to fuck up pretty bad for me to hate a Robert Forster romantic role. I'm also high, so _vague awkward gesture_

- She packs light — just a basket of kittens
- Don't embarrass me in front of all my Facebook followers!
- Man's gotta eat — I eat lumber
- Go that way really fast, and if something gets in your way, turn!
- I'm getting mixed signals — are you about to eat me?
- You know when men are horrible, but you still hang around them?
- I bet her smoking saves the day
- Sure it's pretty, but what have we learned?
- There it is! The agony of defeat! Thank you!
