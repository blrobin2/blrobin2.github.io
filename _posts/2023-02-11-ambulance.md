**Rating:** 4/5

It’s funny, this sort of by-the-books — but very well-executed — action film is a nice change of pace from the dance choreo John Wick-types

Is Jake Gyllenhaal the next Nic Cage?

<i>Sailing
Takes me away to where I've always heard it could be
Just a dream and the wind to carry me
Soon I will be free</i>
