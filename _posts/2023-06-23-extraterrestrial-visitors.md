**Rating:** 1.5/5

* Pod People got no reason to live
* Tonight, music by Rick Wakeman
* What is he, an LA cop?
* ðŸ‘ŒIt stinks!
* Is this white reggae? Oh, itâ€™s Morrissey
* Is he gonna borrow a cup of sugar from Satan?
* Trumpy, you can do stupid things!

I forgot that this is a different movie from Mac and Me, and I wondered why the other alien killed somebody
