Roger Corman has a speaking role in this?? For a cheapie, (some of) the special effects are pretty good! I wish the movie was better

- Oh floating translucent blob, you're my only friend
- She's molting! Oh, gloves
- That tissue isn't human, Jack. It's Kangaroo Jack
- Another successful adventure for Young Al Bundy
