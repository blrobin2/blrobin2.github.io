**Rating:** 2/5

This is the first episode that lines up with the premise presented in the opening credits — Pearl chasing them through space

* The map you are about to see is true
* Oh dot, I've always wanted to go there
* For every action, there is a Jackson
* The natural radar of pine trees protects our borders
* codependent airplanes
* You're fascinating 
* It may have broken from something alive, it could be me, I don't know!
* A woman with luggage??
* Those gosh darn heteros. What are you gonna do?
* Mr. Mantis Goes to Washing-DEATH
* He's flipping us off!
