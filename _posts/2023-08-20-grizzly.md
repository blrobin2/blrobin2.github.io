**Rating:** 2/5

An amusing low-effort Jaws rip-off — the screenwriters claim they wrote this before Jaws, but even costumes line up for some of the match characters for Jaws

Grizzly bears in movies are incapable of looking dangerous — they are dangerous, but their training doesn't let them be scary. So, they don't put it in the first bit of the movie. But when the bear does show up, he looks so cute

Why the hell do they keep the park open? I know, I know, "something something politics."

The makeup for the injuries looks solid in places — brutal when the child loses a leg

Christopher George shows up in the most random stuff — he is so charmless and flat, but he cranks it up a bit

Not good, but it's easy-going
