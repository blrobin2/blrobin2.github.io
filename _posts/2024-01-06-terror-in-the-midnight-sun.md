I didn't intentionally choose a RiffTrax movie, but it's hard to turn down the opportunity

It's not like I could follow this plot anyway.

- Do we live on crust? That's revolting
- John has no idea what he's saying, does he?
- Anyway, here's a dot and some annoying noise
- Guess the animal people are invading somewhere
- He's trying to pass the aurora borealis off as steamed hams
- I left my tray table down during the landing, and nobody noticed!
- Good news, I brought lutefisk for everyone
- Something pushed these animals down the stairs
- Musical score courtesy of Dennis sneaking into Mr. Wilson's basement
- The audience demands a lot more skiing!
- The movie discovered editing?? Where were you when we needed you, editing?
- The reindeer are barking up a storm
