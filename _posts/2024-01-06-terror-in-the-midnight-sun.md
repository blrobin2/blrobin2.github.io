I didn't intentionally choose a RiffTrax movie, but it's hard to turn down the opportunity

It's not like I could follow this plot anyway.

* Do we live on crust? That's revolting
* John has no idea what he's saying, does he?
* Anyway, here's a dot and some annoying noise
* Guess the animal people are invading somewhere
* He's trying to pass the aurora borealis off as steamed hams
* I left my tray table down during the landing, and nobody noticed!
* Good news, I brought lutefisk for everyone
* Something pushed these animals down the stairs
* Musical score courtesy of Dennis sneaking into Mr. Wilson's basement
* The audience demands a lot more skiing!
* The movie discovered editing?? Where were you when we needed you, editing?
* The reindeer are barking up a storm
