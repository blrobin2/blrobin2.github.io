**Rating:** 2/5

Season 8 and first Sci-Fi episode! 

Crow doesn't know Mike, and Mike says that Crow seems different — a nod that Crow is voiced by Bill Corbett. As much as I loved Trace Beaulieu, Bill Corbett is funny (even if he wrote what Eddie Murphy considers his worst film, <i>Meet Dave</i>).

In the credits, they abandon the bit where Cambot is looking in a mirror so his name appears backward

* Gowns! There will be gowns in this movie!
* Listen to that! I heard the "ooo ooo ooo ahh ahh ahh" creature 
* Oh, cram it, nature!
* Vince a-Gill-man??
* Does it even occur to them to check for a zipper?
* Everyone's drifted over to the world of barnacles exhibit 
* -- Sawfish! — Yeah me too, there are lots of them
* Yes, I'm the rare blue-finned... oh, you're looking at the gill man
* It took me two months to teach that to chimps!  Of course, a couple of chimps drowned
* I'm sure if there were a gill man in Helen's room, someone would tell me.
* Back to hog futures
* Helen, did you kill a dog to lure me to your hotel room?
* Here, Chris the dog! Christopher J Dog, you get back here!
* It's Deluth, baby
