Joel and the <i>MST3K</i> gang showed this unaired proof-of-concept at a convention. When Joel quit standup, he moved back to Minneapolis. He had an idea for a show about the last living man and his robot companions at the world's end. A guy with access to KTMA studio wanted to do something with Joel. Joel referenced <i>Silent Running</i>, which had robots made from found material.

The proof-of-concept is about 15 minutes. It has Crow, Gypsy, and Beeper. Beeper was an R2-D2-type who spoke in beeps while Crow translated. The Satellite of Love was a ship Joel designed. Over the transmission, he shows off his robots and other inventions he made — what would later become the invention exchange. He suggests there are 25 robots on the ship.

I'm not rating the movie since I didn't see the whole thing. It looks cheap but fun — I'll definitely watch it sometime.
