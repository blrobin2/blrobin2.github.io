**Rating:** 3/5

* Nice electricity, George
* Don't worry, they were jerks and I like everybody
* He and Sinclair are on a second-name basis
* — It's a U-boat! — A me-boat?
* So that's where iceberg lettuce comes from!
* Could someone please turn off the Halloween Spooktastic Sound Effects CD?
* Good thing we don't mate for life!
