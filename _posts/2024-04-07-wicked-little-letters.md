<blockquote><i>Women officers don't sleuth, love</i></blockquote>Edith (Olivia Coleman) is receiving dirty letters. Her father, Edward (Timothy Spall), and she believe it's her crass Irish neighbor, Rose (Jessie Buckley). But when hundreds of people receive similar letters, Woman Police Officer Moss (Anjana Vasan) looks into it, regardless of whether her supervisors permit it.

<blockquote><i>— Woman Police Officer Moss
</i><i>— You don't have to say that every time — people can see you're a woman</i></blockquote>Jessie Buckley continues the trajectory of <i>Women Talking</i>, where she participates in decent movies with outdated messages. Here, the message seems to be women can do man stuff, too.

<blockquote><i>— She boozes and curses
</i><i>— You do, too. Why is it different when she does it?</i></blockquote>More interesting is a thread the movie starts on how fathers fuck up their kids and the way they perpetuate those cycles.

I'm not sure where that goes because the movie malfunctioned. The theater turned on the lights halfway through, and the audio cut off soon after. The manager said there was nothing he could do about it.

Thankfully, the movie's conclusion is apparent from a few minutes in, so I didn't feel I missed any plot. But for whether it has any nuance in its themes, I cannot say.

I'm not rating this since I didn't finish it, but I'm also not planning on revisiting it.
