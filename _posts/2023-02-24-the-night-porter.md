**Rating:** 2/5

Haven’t watched much, if any, <i>il sadiconazista</i>, so I don’t know where this falls on that particular “quality” spectrum

Also unsure if Liliana Cavani should be the one poking at the wound of the Holocaust. It doesn’t seem like she’s (only) after cheap exploitation, but she also doesn’t seem to have anything to say about Fascism beyond the oft-recounted folktale in Freudian circles of the Holocaust ultimately being an expression of sadomasochism

As a result, the sadomasochistic relationship the movie centers is portrayed as mental illness —a phantom of a trauma neither can shake, a game of codependence that ultimately leaves neither able to survive

I don’t know what to ask of this movie
