Elliott Kalan and Joel spotting! There are a couple of jokes in this episode that have Elliott's sense of humor written all over them.

I don't hate this movie! The special effects are pretty neat — a couple are full-blown magic tricks — and the plot goes in a couple of unexpected directions. It also has one of the more coherent understandings of time travel I've seen.

- The beats are too sick — you gotta bring in the drop
- It isn't just a picture — it's a thousand words!
- The hills have... guys!
- And that was the day we ate the last eagle
- Do as I say, not as I do!
- Nightingale effect setting in... now
