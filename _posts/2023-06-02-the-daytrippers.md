**Rating:** 4/5

Eliza (Hope Davis) finds a love note she didn’t write that may be directed to her husband Louis (Stanley Tucci), so she goes into the city with her family — her sister Jo (Parker Posey), Jo’s boyfriend Carl (Liev Schreiber), and her mother and father (Anna Meara and Pat McNamara) — to investigate

Greg Mottola’s strength has shown to be hangout comedies with real people and stories, and this movie is no exception. The characters are messy, and while the story has a predictable arc, the people who inhabit the film make the experience a memorable one

I don’t think they handle the reveal well, but for a 90s movie, it could be much worse. Still, a memorable entry in the “holiday movies you might not watch with your family.”

Stray Thoughts:
* Is Stanley Tucci just Jason Schwartzmann without the hair?
* The mom is so funny — “Carl, you’re a smart man. What is this? I don’t understand poetry.”
* Low budget, filming in the car with closeups by necessity, putting everyone’s thought processes in different frames — people talk, and no one listens — makes the movie feel cozy
* The wavering focus of the camera moving through the party is so effective 
* Woo, good ending!
