**Rating:** 2/5

Crow calls the evils "dickweeds." Is that TV safe? I guess it doesn't matter on local access.

This movie is about an assassin at the Super Bowl. This may be the first movie with Tom Selleck in it that I've seen. It makes sense, since this is a made-for-tv movie. It's also got my boy Ken Howard.

* That's his messed up teenage daughter. Or his messed up teenage wife. Oh, look, her car is messed up.
* Hey, it's a hotel for luggage. They gotta stay somewhere.
