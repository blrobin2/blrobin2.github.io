<b>Thoughts/Spoilers</b>
* From the esteemed director of <i>Evil Bong</i> and <i>Head of the Family</i>
* Was this shot with a first generation webcam? 480p-looking movie
* "I smell something in the air. Smells feminine."
* Mommy issues!
* Millard Findlemeyer. Googling that last name only returns results for this movie
* "Wherever you are up there, I hope they have strippers and Lone Star"
* Wrestle-a-palooza
* Joe Bob Briggs officiated Robin Sydney and Charles Band's marriage
* Julia won Miss Pretty-Face at Waco
* That's such a big gingerbread cookie mold
* "How many notes eat cheese and live in the sewer?"
* John Carl Buechler worked on the gingerbread man effects
* Margaret Blye is crushing it
* "She's about as cold as a fresh creek catfish"
* Killsbury Doughboy
* Eating a murderous gingerbread man is bound to have consequences
* Jonathan Chase's Gary Busey impersonation is pretty spot on
* "I Can't Help This" by Charles Band playing over the credits
* The closing credits look like a 90s TV opening credit sequence and I love it
* That is the slowest closing credit crawl I've ever seen. I guess so that they have time to play "I Can't Help This" in its entirety
* Joe Bob tearing up at the end of the episode is so touching
