Watching a restored 96 version of this because it was available. Wish I found the 74 minute version…

This is giallo writ horny, even by giallo standards — perspective shots glaring at pubic hair and body parts for several uninterrupted seconds, multiple unsimulated masturbation scenes… you get the picture

Really, the tamest parts of this movie are the murder scenes. They’re slow and the action is broadcast way before it happens, so there’s no tension. The exception is the last 3-4 minutes, which goes sweaty and bloody real quick

Like I kind of wanted to know who the killer was, but I wanted the movie to end more. And then once they revealed it… let’s just say I wasn’t satisfied

There’s a scene with an open window after a lesbian sex scene that must have influenced season 6 of Buffy (IYKYK)

It’s kind of funny at times — the cops shooting the killer at the end has to be one of the all-time ridiculous onscreen deaths — but not enough to justify a watch with friends

It’s fine from a technical standpoint, it just doesn’t do anything all that interesting

You’ve got so many better options out there, don’t bother with this one
