Harry has met the perfect girl, Julie. When his alarm doesn't go off, he misses picking her up at the end of her shift at the coffee shop. He tries calling her on a pay phone but receives a call — "It's happening! This is the big one!" — followed by machine gun fire — "Forget what you heard. Go back to sleep."

4:10 AM — 50 minutes to nuclear war... maybe

The movie is well-paced, but the near real-time progression is almost maddening, but I guess that's the intent

The secondary characters in the diner are a little cartoony, but they don't take up a significant portion of the movie

The third act is where the movie tightens up, and the movie's message comes into focus: love will kill us all

<b>Stray Thoughts</b>

- Did <i>Adaptation </i>use the same stock footage for its "Where to begin?" sequence
- Killer Tangerine Dream soundtrack
- Cliff Notes for <i>Gravity's Rainbow</i> sound... unhelpful
- Pouring the entire creamer into the entire pot of coffee is a mood
- "Nuclear war. What a crock! Over what?"
- Who walks fully nude through a gym? I guess the 80s were a different time
- "Oh no!" billboard
