**Rating:** 2.5/5

This movie has one of my favorite posters. I've clicked it multiple times only to remember its an <i>MST3K</i> movie and that I would watch it soon enough

Despite what these dorks think. this movie makes enough sense and is pretty fun

* I saw <i>The Undead</i> at un-Pine un-Valley
* Satan, the prince of cabaret
* Oh you can kill me. It's okay, I don't care
* When I touch you, I think about myself
* The knight from Muncy
* Digs graves and plays with your mind
* Hey, they're smudging the orange grove!
* — How will you kill her? — By witchcraft and sorcery of course. Oh, and I'll need a gun
* This guy was never in heaven — he got kicked out of community theater
* Oh now I don't get it!
* I'm ready for my execution, Mr. DeMille
* Ugh, this guy is like Satan
