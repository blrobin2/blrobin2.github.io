<i>The Souvenir</i> is that frustrating and too-common story of a terrible man having a chokehold on Julie's life and creative work. <i>Part I</i> explored his living shadow and the excuses codependent lovers make for their addict partners. <i>Part II </i>follows his overdose and Julie's time in film school as she is making her student film and moving on

I remember liking <i>Part I </i>but being frustrated by its sparseness, not finding a deeper emotional connection. <i>Part II </i>functions in part as a meta-criticism of that sparseness as Julie makes her student film, — called The Souvenir — the school board criticizes her script for similar reasons

And the school board is proven right, at least initially — the movie is difficult to watch because you are seeing a director who is too close to the material, too cut off from the emotional pain, to keep everyone on the same page

But, as many filmmakers can attest: somehow, we get to the end, and a movie is made. The climactic sequence is unexpected, and I'm unsure how I feel about it, but I think I like it

The film is a rare case of the sequel enhancing the original — <i>Part I </i>needs <i>Part II</i> to complete it, to give it shape and direction

#### Stray Thoughts

- Richard Ayoade is so funny — such a pretentious asshole
- Of course, the only boy who can convey any sympathy or emotional intelligence is gay
