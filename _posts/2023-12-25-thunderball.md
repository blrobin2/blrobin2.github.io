<b>Stray Thoughts / Spoilers</b>
* Jet packs
* Guess they hadn’t decided Blofeld looks like Dr. Evil yet. The figure behind the shades has a full head of hair.
* Oh cool, more SA on Patricia. She ties him to a machine and says, “First time I’ve felt safe all day.”
* Bond blackmailing Patricia for sex. Such a cool dude.
* They showed perfect mask replication in From Russia with Love. But they made this guy get facial reconstruction surgery?
* They must make these cars out of kerosine-soaked paper, the way they go up in flames.
* Dominique Derval
* Why do they change the actor who plays Felix Leiter in every movie? It’s confusing.
* Throwing a guy in a backyard pool for sharks to eat doesn’t feel like the cleanest way to dispose of a guy.
* If you’re a member of SPECTRE, why would you wear an ostentatious membership ring?
* The pane of glass between Sean Connery and the sharks is visible. From what I read, one got past it and nearly bit him.
* The dog peeing in the middle of the parade
* If you wrap a leg wound with a wet handkerchief, it feels better and you can dance on it.
* The rocket pack that shoots yellowish green bubbles rules
* Did they actually shoot a shark? It was bleeding out of its gills.
* A plane yeets them out of the raft. THE END
