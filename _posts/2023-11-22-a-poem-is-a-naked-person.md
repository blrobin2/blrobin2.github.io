<b><a href="https://boxd.it/pXW6q/detail">Criterion Challenge 2023</a> | 22/52 | Wilco's Closet Picks</b>

A documentary about musician Leon Russell.

Produced between 1972 and 1974, this only received a public release in 2015. Russell financed the vanity project.

Wilco said they loved this movie but said nothing about why.

Leon Russell was a Southern rock musician with a few hits during this documentary. Several artists in different genres have covered "A Song for You," but I can't recall hearing any version.

Removed from its subject, it's a collection of weirdos shit-talking each other.

I had to watch a snake slowly crush and eat a young bird while some dude ranted about capitalist consumerism.
