Bluesy rock as two women walk the castle grounds. They each grab a candelabra and go up the stairs. At the top, two vampires, chained to the walls, drive stakes into their hearts. One tells the women that they must go to the tomb and stab the others.

Night falls as they enter the graveyard. They open the crypt, but they are too late. A woman emerges from her grave. The women scream.

A newlywed couple goes to a castle to see the bride's two cousins. She hasn't seen them since childhood. All she remembers is that the castle is beautiful and the cousins are weird.

But a woman in town tells them that the cousins died yesterday. Still, they drive up to the castle. There, the two women from earlier greet them — custodians of the castle who served the cousins.

The bell tolls, and a woman named Isolde crawls out of the clock. She plays with the bride's hair. The bride is entranced. Isolde takes the bride to the graveyard, where they and the custodians drink from a goblet. Isolde bites the bride on the neck.

Things are not what they seem. For one, the cousins are still alive. Technically.

The cousins used to be vampire hunters — renowned ones at that time— but alas, the vampires got them. So now they're insufferable dweebs for eternity.

The atmosphere is so perfectly gothic — the castle, the fog, skulls, and candles everywhere — I love it

The music is annoying late psychedelic guitar trash.

Plot-wise, this isn't interesting. I guess because there isn't a strong plot — it's predominantly vibes.

The groom just walking around with a gun, shooting anyone or anything.

I would like this more without the cousin vampires. They're annoying and rape-happy.

Still, no one creates a vibe like Rollin.
