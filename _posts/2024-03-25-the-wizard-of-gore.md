<b>Cult Movie Challenge 2016 | 38/52 / HG Lewis</b>

<blockquote><i>Are you certain you know what reality is? How do you know that at this second, you're not asleep in your bed, dreaming you are here in this theater?</i></blockquote>
Montag the Magnificent performs death-defying magic on unwitting volunteers. But later, they die in manners similar to the trick performed onstage — beheadings, impalements, bisection, and whatnot.

The film comments on how movies "give you the luxury of grisly dismemberments and deaths without anyone getting harmed."

The gore in the movie is still nauseating — using actual animal guts is a surefire method.

The movie is a novelty for horror fans, but it doesn't do enough for me to feel anything more than appreciation. The filmmakers made a competent and (mostly) coherent film — a rare W for Lewis.
