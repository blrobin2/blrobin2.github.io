Coffin Joe is back, baby, and he is still obsessed with the continuity of his bloodline. This time, with the help of his assistant Bruno, he'll kidnap six women and put them through horrifying trials. The one who feels no fear will bear his child.

But when given the opportunity, will he take it?

The "horror" is ultimately a Christian fear of an atheist who reproduces. And yet the film's sharpest critique is unintentional — Coffin Joe and the church take the same stand on the value of children's lives over women's, especially when only one can be saved during childbirth.

I love the handwritten opening credits! The images they use sell the fucked up experience you're about to have

The movie has some striking and memorable images — people buried alive, covered in spiders and snakes, scarred with acid, and so on.

The movie is pretty front-loaded. The story gets meandering and slow for large swaths. But it picks up once the movie changes to color.

I like facets of this — it is an improvement on the previous film, even if it isn't consistently exciting.

The version on Shudder has long swaths of dialogue with no subtitles. I understand a little Portuguese, but only enough to know I was missing parts of the story.
