<blockquote><i>[We see] our children as machines to be systemized in order to ensure product — things we have been brainwashed into wanting</i></blockquote>Alex (Fritz Weaver) has invented Proteus, an AI capable of curing leukemia in 4 days, and pushes it toward mining resources, despite the cost to humanity

Susan (Julie Christie) has left her husband Alex because she is frightened of the Proteus project and the depths that Alex and his cohorts are willing to go

While Alex is away for an extended time, Proteus traps Susan in their AI-controlled house, desperate to study humans and understand them

This movie successfully functions as a centerpiece for discussing AI because it performs many tasks that today’s supposed AI performs. For example, the simulation of Susan talking to Walter is reminiscent of what is possible with digital effects, but of course, no technology exists that would make that choice outside of human intervention, so it doesn’t constitute AI

It takes a bit too long to get to its third act, but once it gets there, it’s pretty outrageous. Still, it’s hard not to feel like Cammell held back — whether due to budget or some other factor — and that he did not fully realize the ideas at the core of this movie
