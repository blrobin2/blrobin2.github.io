<blockquote><i>Yes, I'm Petey Wheatstraw, the devil's son-in-law!</i></blockquote>

Petey was born in Miami during a hurricane. He comes out six years old and beats up the doctor and his father.

As a teenager, Bantus trains Petey in Kung Fu and self-respect. Petey vows not to bow to anyone.

As an adult, Petey becomes a successful comedian — so successful that rival comedians funded by the mob take him out so they don't lose their heads.

Lou Cipher visits Petey and offers to bring him back to life. He has one condition — he must marry the devil's daughter and provide him with a grandson.

In case the description is unclear, this movie is silly as hell. Life is miserable, so let's make folks laugh.

This film came after Moore's success as Dolemite, establishing his reputation as a poet of the streets. His Petey Wheatstraw character isn't too different, especially when he comes back from the dead.

<blockquote><i>If you cross the devil, he's going to be mad as hell. I mean, as heaven.</i></blockquote>

The filmmakers did not intend this movie and Rudy Ray Moore's comedy for me. Still, I appreciate Moore's story and his unique comedic perspective. He never takes himself too seriously, and he knows how to entertain.

Also, this is as close to a horror movie as he made.
