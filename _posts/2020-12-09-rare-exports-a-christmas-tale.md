**Rating:** 2/5

While yet another iteration of “what if Santa was actually a bad guy?”, this one deals with Santa as an entity that has been locked away only to be uncovered by miners

They never actually deal with Santa and they somehow figure out how to sell Santa’s elves for profit by training them to be nice and exporting them (hence the title)

The music is constantly whimsical and inspiring, despite nothing going on

It’s a solid build up to a terrible ending
