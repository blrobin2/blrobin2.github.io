A couple living in the Cairo suburbs, Lamia and Nader, have twin sons — one is in a coma after an unknown accident. The parents feel trapped in a prison, caring for him. They have found a solution, but they are worried about the consequences. They’re going to turn the kid in a coma into a vampire.

Where did the vampire blood come from? How will their son handle never growing older? As their nosey neighbors and friends come by to check on them, they wonder if they haven’t traded one prison for another.

The acting is pretty consistent. Nelly Karim and Dhafer L’Abidine are good in a soap opera way. The kids appear robotic, as if directed to be. I mean walking around the house, turning their head before their body, their arms pinned by their sides type of robotic.

The color and cinematography are passable, bordering on good in some scenes. Some tighter shots and better lighting would help this tremendously. The lighting borders on cruel to some of the older actors.

With such a cheesy score and completely overbearing sound design, the movie falls flat and becomes a tedious watching experience.

Like <i>The Room</i>, the story is repetitive. I like one twist and how it plays out! The others are confusing.

This movie is not very good, but it’s pretty funny. Invite your friends who enjoy watching bad movies over to watch this, and you’ll get a few laughs in.
