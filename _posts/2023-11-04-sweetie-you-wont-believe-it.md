Authorities warn against going into the woods. Women keep going missing.

Dastan, sick of his nagging pregnant wife — how dare she need any attention or input from him? — dodges that bitch (his words) and goes fishing in the woods with his friends.

Meanwhile, a moronic gang of four shoots someone in the head. Our fishing heroes witness it, so the gangsters chase them to kill them.

Emerging from the woods is a man, his face marked with scars. In a sudden act of aggression, he stabs one gangster in the eye, leaving him writhing in agony, and then fades away. The other gang members find him dead and think the fishing boys did it. Do you see where this is going?

The movie highlights its disdain for women with the only other female character, a gas station attendant with acne. She repulses the men so much they don’t get their change for their purchases.

The movie draws its humor primarily from gory murders and scatological humor. While it may not be inherently wrong to use these for laughs, in this context, it becomes joyless and cruel.

In the end, the message seems to be, “Boys just need their bros, you know?” Otherwise, it’s a hastily constructed grouping of gross-out gags.

The scarcity of good horror comedies leaves horror fans wanting more. This has a budget and competent cinematography. It’s just not very good.
