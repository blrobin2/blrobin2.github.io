In the distant future of 1999, the United Nations Science Committee confined all the monsters on an island called Monsterland. There, scientists study their behavior.

Suddenly, all the communication systems go offline. The research lab and the rest of the island filled with a mysterious yellow gas. UNSC sends a satellite to observe the island. Whenever they get close, something jams their communication.

Emergency broadcasts from the world capitals reveal the monsters are attacking â€” Rodan in Moscow, Mothra in Paris, Manda in London, Baragon in Paris, and Godzilla in New York. Tokyo, however, remains untouched.

The spaceship Moonlight SY-3 detects a UFO. Before they can act, they receive orders to return to Earth and investigate Monsterland. There, they discover the secret plot that puts the entire human race in jeopardy.

Though the movie features eleven different monsters, the plot streamlines the events into one major story. It's been ages since I've had this much fun watching Godzilla.

The special effects are the best they've been thus far, and we get significantly more fights and action sequences.

It'll be hard to surpass this one. I'm not sure if any of the remaining Honda Godzillas for me to see will top this.
