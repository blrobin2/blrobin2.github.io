**Rating:** 3.5/5

Obviously thankful for this if only it brought about one of my favorite TV shows. At this stage, however, the show has exhausted the humorous elements from this, so it’s hard to watch without the show in mind

Nick is the funniest of the vampires, his nonplussed attitude really works for me

The Beast before the reveal is kinda funny

Nice seeing Rhys Darby, he’s funny

The cops searching the house is funny — the cops in general, actually, every time they’re on screen I laugh

I was a bigger fan of the concept than the execution last time around. This time I think I’m overall more onboard and able to enjoy it
