Gilles (Paul Naschy), a drifter looking for work, ends up doing groundwork at the home of three sisters — Claude (Diana Lorys), defined by her prosthetic hand; Nicole (Eva León), who needs to get laid; and Ivette (Maria Perschy), who uses a wheelchair, but her injuries may be psychosomatic

Then, a series of murders occur — someone is killing all the blue-eyed, blonde-haired women in the village. Gilles is suspect number one, but the actual killer may be one of the sisters

A convoluted movie plot-wise that manages to make it all work — the mystery of the sisters and the murder moves along well, and while I had a theory early on, I still found myself engaged with it. I watched a dubbed version, and the dubbed performances were surprisingly good

Solid film — a standout in 70s Spanish horror

Stray Thoughts

- Menacing minor-key rendition of Frere Jaques is hilarious, but they develop the hell out of it
- The murder of a live pig onscreen :(
