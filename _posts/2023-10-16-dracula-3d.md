</b>
Bad wigs, poor acting, non-existent pacing, cheap sets, an Ed Wood-ass soundtrack, and artless cinematography come together for a remarkably inept movie

Rutger Hauer is doing his damnedest to make his scenes work. I'm not saying he's great here, just noticeably better

Why does Dracula have a picture book explaining his secret?

How did four people write this?

It's Dracula, alright. But a horny opening and ridiculous effects aren't enough to save this bad boy
