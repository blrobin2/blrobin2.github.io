* The Bond theme I've heard the most since it played on classic rock radio
* Why would M walk directly to the bedroom?
* The tarot card reading is somewhat on point
* No seriously, why can't they keep a Felix for more than one movie?
* The dead taxi driver car stunts were tense!
* "For 20 bucks, I'll take you to a Ku Klux Klan cookout."
* Jane Seymour as Solitaire
* Bond pleads to Solitaire to fuck him, using a tarot deck of exclusively Lover cards to trick her and take her virginity
* A "holy shit!"
* Calling this a boat chase is generous. A couple of solid stunts, but it keeps going and going.
* You can see the buoys they placed for the stunt driver to hit the right trajectory
* Chekov's magnetic watch
* Mr. Big inflated and exploded
