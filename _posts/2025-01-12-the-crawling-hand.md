This episode is one of my faves — so many jokes, here's some I liked this time around:

- — You alright? — Shut up and throw the cup away
- Gotta have that hand!
- I can't believe she's gotta do that scene over again
- [Drinks water] Good!
- June's boy?
- John, George, Paul, Ringo? Who am I kidding, they're never getting back together
- He's going to soil that kid's stadium blanket
