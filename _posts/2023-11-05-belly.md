<b>The only difference between <i>Belly</i> and <i>Casino</i> is that <i>Belly</i> is good.</b>

The film is the story of two friends, Tommy Bundy (DMX) and Sincere (Nas), as they rise in the drug game, fall to the snitches, and transcend into something more than spiritual.

Throughout the 90s, Hype Williams was redefining what hip-hop music looked like. From the vibrant visuals of Positive K’s <i>I Got a Man</i> to the glossy science-fiction of Missy Elliott’s <i>The Rain</i>, Hype had an eye for the aesthetic. His vision put him leagues above other music video directors.

He didn’t want to follow the trends — he wanted to establish them.

The resulting movie is a visual feast of Black style and Black skin. Its beauty pre-dates Barry Jenkins’ successes in <i>Moonlight</i> and sits alongside Wong Kar-wai’s colorful compositions in <i>In the Mood for Love</i>.

My only complaint lies in the story structure, which is often confusing. Don't believe the critics, this picture is great.
