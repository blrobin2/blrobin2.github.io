This movie rules! I had a smile on my face for the entire third act.

<b>Stray Thoughts/Spoilers</b>
* Dr. Holly Goodhead
* Bond was still surprised to see a woman doctor in the year of our lord 1979
* Bond kills a henchman, and Drex just lets him keep playing?
* The guy hiding in the coffin!
* The high-speed gondola/motorcar
* Callback to <i>Spy Who Loved Me</i> where the guy looks at alcohol after spotting a Bond vehicle, wondering if he's drunk and hallucinating — a thing that definitely happens
* The code to the door is the <i>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</i> theme.
* The clocktower fight
* "Play it again, Sam," says Bond as Chang falls through a piano. The only piano joke the writers could think of?
* How does the diary shoot a dart??
* Bond at Carnivale in a tuxedo
* Jaws chewing through the cable for the cable car
* The woman who smiles at Jaws does NOT have braces. Never did
* Dr. Goodhead tears out a tuft of that guy's hair
* Bond dressed as Clint Eastwood, watching two monks fight
* MORE boat chases. At least Bond has <i>Wacky Races</i>-grade weapons
* Jaws is included in the selection of perfect human specimens — Nietzsche's Übermensch is alive and his name is Jaws
* Space station emergency stop
* Oh my god, all those men in space shooting each other with lasers. <i>Star Wars</i> wishes
* Chekov's wristwatch dart gun
* Jaws and his partner having some champagne before being launched into space  — "Don't worry, they'll make it. It's only 100 miles to Earth"
* Zero gravity space sex on the monitor. Q says, "I think he's attempting re-entry, sir."
