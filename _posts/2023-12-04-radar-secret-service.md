- Look at all those dead cows under that tower
- War is good! Stupid peace
- Can radar save our stifling marriage?
- Evidence that christ himself invented radar!
- Send up some gas juice! You know, laugh water!
- Employees must wash tongue before returning to work
- Boy, vintage cars were really popular back then
- the calls are coming from inside the car!
- I gotta go shave above and below my mustache
- Thanks to radar, the scene promptly ends!
