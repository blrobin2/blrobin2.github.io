Somebody told me that Cillian Murphy hangs brain in this — I just wanted to see how Cillian Murphy’s penis was doing since we haven’t seen it since <i>28 Days Later</i>. No dice!

We’ll have to wait for the 4K UHD screen grabs to conclusively say if I saw his testicles through Florence Pugh’s legs — if you are imagining a sexy scene, you forget that this is Christopher Nolan here — a man who I can only presume has missionary position sex with his WIFE, thank you very much, for the express purposes of procreation

Reach out in the comments if them<i> Peaky Blinders</i> boys give up the goods, because this gal is thirsty, and lord these New Mexico deserts are dry
