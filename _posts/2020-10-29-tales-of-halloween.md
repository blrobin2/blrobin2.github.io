**Rating:** 2/5

It seems to be a common problem with most anthologies: there’s maybe one good story, and bunch of awful ones. With 10 stories, there’s 3 that I kind of like:

- The Weak and the Wicked
- Grim Grinning Ghost
- Bad Seed (this one I actually like quite a bit)

Thankfully, the stories are all very short, so it’s an easier-going experience than 4- or 5- story anthologies that can feel like an eternity
