**Rating:** 3/5

My review for this was turning into a rant, so I'm making some bullet points:

* I love April Wolfe, who co-wrote this movie. Her podcast <i>Switchblade Sisters</i> is a major reason why I started watching horror again.
* I like the original <i>Black Christmas</i> fine, but it isn't sacred ground to me.
* I like how we know the killers from the get-go.
* I don't mind how overt the feminist bent is. Sometimes, being straightforward isn't necessarily a negative thing in a world where men watch <i>Whiplash</i> and think the message is "work harder."
* I don't like the supernatural angle. It's present in the opening text, so it wasn't a surprise.
* I don't love Landon. If anything is cringe in this movie, it's him.
* I don't like the cheap pull quotes in the script. "Boys will beâ€¦ well, you know," "Did you just 'not all men' me?", and so on.

Overall, I completely understand not liking this. The .5-star ratings are confusing, though.
