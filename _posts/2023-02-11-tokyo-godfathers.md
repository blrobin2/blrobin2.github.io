On Christmas, a homeless trans woman finds an abandoned baby who would become the child she couldn’t have — her miracle virgin birth

Is Satoshi Kon, whose sensibility always straddled between progressive and exploitative, the best person to tell this story? Probably not

But this is also one of the rare depictions of a trans person from this time that attempts a sympathetic portrayal, if only in the name of a larger question: for all those who desire to be mothers, how does god decide who gets to be and who don’t?

I dare you to predict where this movie goes
