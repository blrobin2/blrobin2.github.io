Tommy runs through the rain in his yellow mackintosh. He stands before the grave of Jason Voorhees. He hears a couple of boys coming, so he goes to hide. The men dig up Jason’s grave, yipping and hollering like they’re digging for gold.

As they pry open the coffin, Jason’s machete-welding hand swings up and stabs one of them in the stomach. Before the other can react, Jason stabs him in the neck. Jason steps out of the grave, hockey mask and all. He sees Tommy in the bushes and approaches him with his machete. Lightning glimmers against the blade as Jason brings it up.

Tommy wakes up in the back of a psychiatric facility transport van. He’s now a teenager. The van takes him to a halfway house for troubled teens called Pinehurst. Neighbors of Pinehurst despise the place, scared of the “crazy kids.” They’re the worst characters in any of the movies thus far.

The movie's theme seems to be “If you think Jason’s crazy, look at everyone else!”

Joey pesters Vick a bunch, so Vick kills him with an axe. So begins the theoretical murder mystery that the movie tries to set up. Who is killing all these people? Is it Vick? Tommy? The neighbors? Is it Jason, or someone pretending?

You can tell the lack of faith in their special effects. Even when we have a simple throat slit, the camera zooms in to where it happens just below screen.

Almost every woman in the movie shows their boobs at some point. Considering some are only on screen for a minute or two, it’s pretty impressive.

They set up a chainsaw v. machete fight that could have been great but poorly pieced together.

I don’t hate this movie. But it does so little that I can’t say it did anything for me.

#### Spoilers \_\*\*</b>

I like the idea of Jason becoming a persona <i>a la</i> Ghostface that people use to murder folks. It’s a shame they don’t carry that forward with the next movie.
