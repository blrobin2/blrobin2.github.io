**Rating:** 2/5

* Now, let's see if we can strand this baby
* Can I have some borscht, Dr. Stalin?
* Boy is that guy square
* I hate it when people sing along to the radio
* Man is this great, I got a place to live and a brand new dad!
* Dear mom, I hate Camp Granada
* Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right, here I am stuck in a made-for-tv movie
