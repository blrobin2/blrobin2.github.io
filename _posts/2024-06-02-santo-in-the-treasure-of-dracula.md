**Rating:** 2.5/5

Apologies to <a href="https://boxd.it/MltZ" rel="nofollow">CinemaMystic</a>, I jumped on the Gizmoplex season. And judging by how poorly the crowdfunding went, probably the last season for a while.

Straight away, the opening is noticeably cheaper. Which I don't have a problem with! <a href="https://boxd.it/MltZ" rel="nofollow">Some folks</a> say the show was at its best when it felt lo-fi.

Thin Jonah! No more Elliott Kalan on the writing staff :(

* Remember, you've convinced your wife of 30 years that you're blind
* Dream of earless, silver-faced demons
* Madam, may I interest you in some cholera?
* If you see my neck or legs, we'll have to be married
* A vampire? In this economy?
* The suspense is killing the orchestra
* You fool! I've been me the whole time!
* Santo, don't make me kill you over that sweater
* Most of wrestling is different types of hugs
