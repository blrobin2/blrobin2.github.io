Gael García Bernal is great in this. While too old for the part — his character is around my age — he gives an energetic and heartfelt performance.

The wrestling matches were entertaining, which is this movie's most prominent success. I loved all Cassandro's costumes and seeing Gael García Bernal's thighs.

The story does not have any major conflict. Saúl Armendáriz's real life was far more dramatic. I'm happy to see a gay character not try to commit suicide or get beat up or murdered. But we needed more than what the movie gives us to carry a 100-minute film.

That said, the characterization and interpersonal dynamics of the Saúl character are sharp and play out in subtle but motivated ways.

In the end, it's too much of a biopic to have a strong personality.
