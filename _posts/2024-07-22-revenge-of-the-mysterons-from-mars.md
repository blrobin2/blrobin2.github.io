Joel and Crow are stranded in space on Thanksgiving. They at least caught the Macy's Thanksgiving Parade. Tom Servo makes his first appearance after the commercial break.

Another Supermarionation movie â€” four episodes of <i>Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons</i> sewn together. Another Gerry Anderson joint. This episode aired the same day as the previous episode, <i>Invaders from the Deep</i>.
