Nami's Late Late Night used to be a hot show, but the ratings are low.

Nami receives a snuff film in the mail. At first, it shows road signs and landscape signifiers. Then, a woman in chains. A blade cutting into her leg. A shiv piercing an eye. Finally, a shot of Nami, disgusted.

Nami puts together a crew to investigate. Hopefully, whatever they find will boost their ratings.

The map shows they should be in a field. Instead, they find an old army base. They split up and explore.

One by one, someone murders them. Meanwhile, Nami meets a stranger who knows the killer.

A sick soundtrack, outrageous special effects, horrifying murders, and wild cinematography make this a memorable experience.

Poor pacing and underdeveloped characters knock it down a tad.

Still, it's wacky as hell.

<b>Stray Thoughts</b>

- The spastic blue-toned scenes remind me of <i>Tetsuo</i> — thanks to Japan Home Video.
- Camera flash as the only light source is always creepy.
- So many pranks! No wonder folks die.
- One theme sounds like "All Around the World."
- These women are braver than the troops — whenever you see me saluting, it will secretly be to them.
- That last shot. Holy shit. I can't wait to watch the sequel.
