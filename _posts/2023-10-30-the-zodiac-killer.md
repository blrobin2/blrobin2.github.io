This movie is a portrait of a mail carrier with a mentally ill father and a love of killing strangers and getting attention for it. If only his father loved him.

The movie wildly swings from the most tedious conversations committed to film and jaunty jazz scoring shocking murders.

This came out while the Zodiac Killer was actively writing cops. Tom Hanson claimed to have made this to lure the Zodiac out of hiding since he couldn't resist seeing it. I don't know how that helps anyone.

The end credits are so eerie, taking photos of the murders and then changing focus to the credits

I love that this movie, based on fact, has an actual psychic.
