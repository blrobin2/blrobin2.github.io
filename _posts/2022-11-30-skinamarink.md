An anti-<i>House of Leaves</i> where space contracts, commentary is absent, and the camera can only manage to find the liminal spaces where something shouldn’t be

The meta plays out in the artificial film grain, the rough audio quality, and the goofy sound effects (windows and toilets disappear with a 50s sci-fi warble). It creates so much distance between the viewer and what’s happening on screen that it’s hard to feel anything

Where films like <i>We're All Going to the World's Fair </i>use artifice to enhance the narrative structure, this one uses everything in its power to hide the fact that there’s not much here — you must construct the horror yourself from the Lego pieces the film provides. Truly, I would not have understood a single thing that happened or who said what if not for the closed captioning

It’s not a terrible film — in fact I kind of like it — it just made some choices that I think detract from making this a memorable or worthwhile experience
