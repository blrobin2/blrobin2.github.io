“Dad Rapes Daughter and Dies of Knife Wound,” reads the newspaper headline. Said daughter (Toni Lawrence, the director’s daughter) is put in a psych ward and given shock treatment, but when a nurse and doctor run off to fuck, she escapes

An old farmer / former circus magician (Marc Lawrence, the director) steals bodies from the morgue to feed his pigs because that’s all they’ll eat after accidentally feeding them a person. “I don’t think it’s against the law to turn dead people into pigs,” says the sheriff

Toni shows up at the pig farm looking for work, and the farmer makes a place for her. But on a date when a guy won’t take “no” for an answer, she slashes him up. The farmer finds out and helps dispose of the body. And so the cycle begins

The movie has very little pig presence, focusing more on Toni’s character, who regularly calls and talks to her daddy, even though we know he’s dead. She can’t accept her role and blocks out not only his murder but all of them

The two lead performances aren’t stellar, but they are thought-out and (slightly) less exploitative than the material suggests. And while the filmmaking is just okay, the story has just enough weird going on to make it work

One murder scene has the quickest edits I’ve seen in a movie from this era, just an explosion of images. It’s not good or anything — it’s just noteworthy
