**Rating:** 3.5/5

Gillian received a compliment once that she would make a good murderer. So, she starts on a documentary called<i> I, Murderer</i>, about how to perform the perfect murder.

She's putting scripts out there, but folks don't want to do her material. But when some producers tell her to be bold and take risks, she takes them up on it.

The documentary expands from the perfect murder to the steps to becoming a serial killer and getting away with it.

The film is not subtle in the language it lampoons â€” unlikeable leads, strong female characters, and anything around intersectionality that comes out of a producer's mouth.

It gets off to a rocky start, but once it gets into her making the documentary, it's so funny and uncomfortable.

It gets fucked up, but it does so by committing to the bit. I don't love all of it, but that's the point.
