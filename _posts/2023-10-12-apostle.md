A cult has taken Thomas’ sister to their island. Thomas (Dan Stevens) must go in secret and rescue her. 
<blockquote><i>Don’t pay the ransom until you see her alive</i></blockquote>Among the flock, Thomas learns about Prophet Malcolm (played by Michael Sheen) and the god to whom he is a prophet. He also sees the mercy given to those who do not belong. Namely, none.

The movie balances honoring <i>The Wicker Man</i> and creating its own original storyline, exploring faith and the pain it takes to keep it alive.

Its violence is brutal (expected from Gareth Evans of <i>The Raid</i> fame) and doesn’t always feel necessary.

Despite its silliness, the script never failed to engage me. Overall, I enjoyed the secrets of the story and how it ended.
