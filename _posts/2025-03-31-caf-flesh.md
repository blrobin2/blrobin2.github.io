<blockquote><i>Able to exist, to sense… to feel everything—but pleasure. In a world destroyed, a mutant universe, survivors break down to those who can and those who can't. 99% are Sex Negatives. Call them erotic casualties. They want to make love, but the mere touch of another makes them violently ill. The rest, the lucky one percent, are Sex Positives, those whose libidos escaped unscathed. After the Nuclear Kiss, the Positives remain to love, to perform… And the others, well, we Negatives can only watch.. can only come.. to… CAFE FLESH…</i></blockquote>

I know what will turn you on: three men dressed as babies, a rat-faced milkman, and a woman casually knitting before jerking off the rat man's tail. Stephen Sayadian is fully committed to making the world weird and the sex boring. Or, you know, maybe that's everyone's thing in the future.

Yes, I only watched this because Charli XCX mentioned watching it. Maybe it's because there's a man dressed as a baby wearing a BRAT bib?

This score fucking rules.
