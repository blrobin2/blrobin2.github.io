This film has the classic Dracula characters but with some changes. Jonathan Harker comes on as a librarian to Count Dracula (Christopher Lee).

Only this time, Harker knows that Dracula is dangerous and intends to use his position to end Dracula's reign of terror.

Van Helsing (Peter Cushing) rides into town to find Harker. In this version, they are already friends and working together to stop Dracula.

The plot changes help speed up the time to action â€” so much so that Harker gets only a few minutes of screen time before Dracula takes him.

The movie still has some lulls, especially with getting Lucy's family on board. But I love Hammer, and I love Lee and Cushing together, so this would have to be pretty bad for me not to at least like it.
