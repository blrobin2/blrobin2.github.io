Maddy’s best friend Alexis was a cheerleader at Blackfoot High. Maddy was putting together a video profile on Alexis for her media tech class, encouraging Alexis to show off some cheerleading tricks. Alexis’ teammates throw her in the air but miss her. Alexis lands on her head and dies.

Two days before the start of her senior year, Maddy tries out for the cheerleading squad. Though her presence throws the team, Maddy’s gymnastic background lands her a place on the squad.

Later that night, Maddy’s ex-girlfriend Leena comes over unannounced. Leena’s cat, Madeline, got sick after Leena gave her the name. Or rather, the cat died. And yet, Madeline is alive and well in Leena’s arms.

Maddy attends a cheerleader pool party. There, she convinces Tracy that Terry cheated on her. Tracy, drunk and vulnerable, kisses Maddy. Terry witnesses the kiss and can’t get it out of his head. The following evening, the football team and cheerleaders have a rager. Terry shows up and punches Tracy. Martha tries to call the cops, and a series of events leads to the cheerleaders dying.

Leena, however, has some tricks up her sleeves that unleash absolute chaos.

This movie takes nearly half its runtime to get to its premise. Once it does, the tone shifts from teen drama to supernatural comedy. I don’t mind — it’s funny! It’s just disjointed.

I’m surprised I don’t see more comparisons to <i>Jennifer’s Body</i>, what with the resurrected bloodsucking and gay shit. I’ve seen mentions from <i>I Know What You Did Last Summer</i> to <i>Pretty Little Liars</i>. This movie is its own thing — it makes some wild choices I’ve never seen before.

I’m bummed that the movie ends on a cliffhanger. This movie’s negative reception means a sequel is unlikely.

I have no idea how to rate this, but I had a lot of fun!
