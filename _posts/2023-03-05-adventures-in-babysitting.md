**Rating:** 2.5/5

Daryl is the most annoying onscreen presence in recent memory. In fact, every dude in this movie sucks so hard

The conceit that the carjackers wrote their entire business plan in a Playboy magazine is…

Elizabeth Shue is fantastic, that hair never quits

I chuckled here and there, but this movie hasn’t aged super well
