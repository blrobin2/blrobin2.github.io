Seems Altman likes smart-asses who end up in trouble whether they like it or not

Warren Beatty isn’t very good in this, he’s handsome but has nowhere near the charisma to carry a movie by smirking instead of acting, but the movie moves along fine in spite of it

The Wild West is boring as hell, but everything has a weird murky glow, oversaturated yellows and reds, and that weird Altman humor. Also, the third act really comes together and makes for a compelling finale

In the end, it turned into something I enjoyed a good bit
