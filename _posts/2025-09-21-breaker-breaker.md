**Rating:** 1.5/5

This film was Chuck Norris's father's favorite movie of his. Why do trucker movies have to have arm wrestling subplots? I guess it's just this and <i>Over the Top</i>.

Beware the Jack Nance jump scare — I love that he's going full Nance while talking to the famously unexpressive Norris. This movie is so much weirder than the premise suggets — Nance fits in more than Norris.

I love the name Arlene Trimmings.

* This rattlesnake sure likes bittin!
* I sure do love unspecified things.
* Thumbs up to the truck things you're doing!
* He says he can put you down in 10 seconds! He says he's the best damn veterinarian in the whole county.
* Hold on, just gotta put on my death skull codpiece so you know I'm not very nice.
* — They arrested a flag? — Yep, its colors ran—flat out defied every bumper sticker and Big Dog tee shirt in town.
* A quick pose for Tiger Beat over here…
* The kind of van that says, "Ask me about my blacklight poster of Tom Bombadil."
* -- They killed your uncle George. — But uncle George is supposed to shoot me in the head this afternoon!
* — Just get in the car! — My six-word review of Driving Ms. Daisy
