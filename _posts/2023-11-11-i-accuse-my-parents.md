* Wanted: mother
* It says here your feet don't exist
* So Jimmy, do you like your kneecaps?
* Yes Satan, speak to me through this song
* Quite a long line at the petty larceny line
* It's the three hardboiled eggs she ordered
* Jimmy is suddenly seized with an essay idea
* Hey, Cafe! I've heard of this place
