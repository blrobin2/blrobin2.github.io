**Rating:** 3/5

Kaiju hellraiser? Some dummies dig for treasure where you aren’t supposed to and wake up a demon vampire thing. Hijinks ensue, and a water imp is awakened and fights the demon thing. He fails, cut to, like, 100 good demons coming out and partying

Definitely a kids' movie — despite the blood and cursing — but all the monster costumes ruled
