Gerard, a chaotic bisexual who lives for dick and double vodkas, meets Christine at a lecture after a failed cruising attempt. Christine is always filming Gerard, and he loves the attention, so they start hooking up

Gerard is also a Catholic who has some life-destroying visions — a hotel room with an eye seeping through the peephole, a woman pointing a gun at him (or is it a key?), Christine castrating him with a pair of scissors — real average stuff

As Gerard spends time with Christine, he discovers she has another boy toy, Herman, that he'd love to get a piece of. So Gerard sticks around in hopes of meeting him — having a vision of Herman on the cross in underwear he chooses to pull down

He also begins to believe that Christine is a witch

It's good to know that Paul Verhoeven has never had a subtle bone in his body. Though a spiritual precursor to <i>Basic Instinct,</i> this is much hornier and gorier. Gerard's always got his dick out for god and country — I haven't seen this much casual dong in a movie in recent memory

Despite how wild this sounds, it isn't without its duller moments. Still, it's enough of a raucous journey to recommend
