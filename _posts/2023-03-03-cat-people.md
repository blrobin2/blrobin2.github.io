**Rating:** 4/5

Stray thoughts:
* Why is he keeping that cat in a box all day? Also, what a terrible gift, regardless of whether it’s for a cat person or otherwise
* When he says he’s never been unhappy before — more than once — and that it makes him question his love for Irena… what a fuckboy
* Jean Paul is a good cat name
* The chase down the alley is such a good scene, the sound design added such a sense of dread
* It’s clear now how little Paul Schrader did for his remake other than add some sex and violence — which is fine with me — but his version also felt less tense and ambiguous 

Jealousy is a hell of a drug
