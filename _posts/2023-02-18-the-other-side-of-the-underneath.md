**Rating:** 3/5

Confrontational, shrill, hysteric — in its own terms, a performance hellbent on freeing the expectations and portrayal of the “sane” woman from the patriarchal foundations of psychoanalysis, whose primary interest parades as a means to a healthy society but is, as most cultural institutions, another form of subjugation and control — it is not me who is sick, but the system that deems me so

By today’s standards, most of the imagery is at most as shocking as an Alice Cooper concert. The more interesting parts are the improvised therapy sessions

Still, I dig it
