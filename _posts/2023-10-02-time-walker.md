**Rating:** 1/5

* So far, this looks like the dramatization of a movie
* Bless... this... mess?
* Everyone wears cleats in this film
* So tell me, what do you think of The Critique of Pure Reason, doll face?
* Are you suggesting that our fungus... is among us?
* And don't wash a red towel in a white load!
* bright lights, big mummy
* who is humming?!
* [slo-mo] oooopsieees
