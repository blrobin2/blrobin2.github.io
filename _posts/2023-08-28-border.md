A border guard can smell shame, guilt, and rage, making her excellent at detecting smugglers. Her unconventional appearance makes her a social pariah. She's living with someone, but her family does not trust him

When a guilty smuggler who looks like her tries to cross, she senses something wrong but cannot find it on them — they both have a scar just above the tailbone, leaving her to question her origin

The movie feels like it could have functioned as a trans/queer allegory until the third act, where the narrative twists into something else — it's unnecessary and will likely ruin the movie for a lot of folks

The movie still works and is internally coherent — the theme of not belonging and not knowing why remains strong, along with some notes on generational trauma

The character design is subtle and thought-through, and the actors bring an added dimension

Overall, it's a finely crafted movie — it just happens to throw away its most compelling bits
