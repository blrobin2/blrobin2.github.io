**Rating:** /5

Now this is a proper MST3K movie. The visual effects are insane, and everything else is so bad

* Watch me play God
* My unrelated narcolepsy!
* Tell them I died trying to kill an adult
* I learned this smile from a playing cardÂ 
* They can't be killed because they're already dead, just like the Minions
