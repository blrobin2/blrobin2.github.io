Now this is a proper MST3K movie. The visual effects are insane, and everything else is so bad

- Watch me play God
- My unrelated narcolepsy!
- Tell them I died trying to kill an adult
- I learned this smile from a playing card
- They can't be killed because they're already dead, just like the Minions
