<i>Bengal, 1910</i>

We center on the Roys, an impoverished family in a small village.

Durga gets in trouble for stealing fruit from Mrs. Mukherjee's orchard. Though Durga's mother, Sarbajaya, discourages it, Auntie Indir does not see the harm.

Indir also upsets Sarbajaya by taking food as she pleases from their food.

The birth of baby Apu brings a moment of unity to the family.

Harihar, Sarbajaya's husband, is a priest and does not bring in much money. Harihar aspires to be a poet and scholar. They hope Durga can find a good husband who will care for them. Meanwhile, he travels to the city in search of better job opportunities.

As Apu and Durga grow up, they become close and share moments of wonder — seeing folk theater or looking at pictures in a bioscope. At night, they listen to the sound of a passing train.

One day, they go far from home to fields cut with power lines and train tracks. They can see the passing train. Life moves on, even when they aren't home.

Nothing lasts forever, so appreciate the small joys, the moments of confusion and sadness, the brief seconds that remind you that another world exists outside your own.

The film has a rambling quality — time starts and stops, and some moments seem frozen while others jump out of nowhere. It circles its themes and plot points, hitting them at different stages of life and watching as they develop. Initially, the film may appear aimless. But the story builds collectively.

The film draws on neo-realistic ideas, focusing on a small cast and story. Though we see the difficult social conditions, the movie diverges in how it engages with Apu's imagination. Ray worked with Renoir on The River, so he applies those lessons here.

Though Indian film has been around as long as moving pictures, this was one film that brought India international attention.

While the film captures an authentic Bengali experience, it also conforms to more art house expectations — notably, excluding the popular song and dance in Indian cinema.

The soundtrack is perfect. Ravi Shankar's sitar transcends cultures and speaks with universal emotions.

The movie paints gorgeous landscapes and genuinely incredible compositions. It offers a unique window into a different time and life.
