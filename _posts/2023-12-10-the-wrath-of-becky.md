**Rating:** 3/5

Becky has been running away from foster home after foster home. Two years later, she remains off the grid, working as a waitress in a diner and training herself in self-defense and parkour.

She lives with an older woman named Elana, who picked her up when she was hitchhiking. Elana is a misanthrope like her, but she teaches her gratitude, which helps put her life in perspective.

The radio details a Proud Boys-adjacent group called the Noble Men, riding into Becky’s neck of the woods. After Becky “accidentally” spills coffee on one of them at the diner, they follow her home.

When she wakes up, Diego is gone. Her only lead is that these guys were heading to Darryl’s. Thankfully, the town only has two Darryls.

Unlike the first movie, the villains don’t speak in vague racial purity terms, but say legitimately fucked up and misogynistic stuff. It’s over the top, but still motivated.

The kills are pretty good, but too few. The choreography is clumsy but not heinous.

I had reservations about this sequel, but the news of another coming piqued my interest.
