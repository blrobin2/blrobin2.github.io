**Rating:** /5

* "I bet cowboys don't have to wash all the time." Hell of a dream, Billy.
* It's not sissy to be clean. Take it from me, an empty chair who watches you sleep.
* Lie down and close your eyes. You're in Soapy's world now.
* You and I must tame animals more dangerous than bucking broncos. I'm talking about our feelings, Billy.
