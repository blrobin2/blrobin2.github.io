<b>I've heard of muscle memory, but this is ridiculous!</b>

Bill (TV's Jeff Fahey) is a criminal psychologist. Leaving a consultation, he gets in a car wreck. Bill loses an arm, but doctors perform an experimental surgery to graft a new arm onto him. Before he goes under, he sees several surgeons with shotguns and others dismembering a body.

In a class he teaches, he explores the motivations of what could make a seemingly functional human turn violent. During the class, he keeps having visions of blood and strangulation.

His arm has a tattoo, "Striker" — a tattoo only given to death row inmates. Running his prints through AFID, he learns his new arm belonged to a convicted serial killer.

<blockquote><i>You have this guy's arm. You don't have his personality.</i></blockquote>

Remo (Brad Dourif) got the other arm and now paints disturbing images — the same images Bill sees in his head. Mark has the legs and can dunk a basketball but can't control his car.

The three band together, even though Bill seems to be the only one suffering. That is until Mark returns home, and someone is waiting to take his legs.

From a filmmaking perspective, this is a hit-or-miss movie. It starts strong but sags severely in the middle and almost makes up for it within the last ten minutes.

Still, this absurd pulp hits a few pleasure centers for me.

#### Stray Thoughts/Spoilers

- Jeff Fahey thinks those ice-blue eyes can act for him. He might be right.
- What a killer car wreck scene! I don't know how that stunt guy is still alive. Is he... is he still alive?
- Why do they wait to put him under until after he's already getting his arm removed?
- The surgeons carrying shotguns is so funny
- I would be so scared to move my arm the way he does with all those sutures
- The daughter sees his new arm. "I still love you, daddy." Nothing is more crushing than the words of an honest child
- His new arm is better at fingering his wife
- Kim Delaney is so pretty. If she were my wife, I would simply not hit my kids
- Wow, this third act is ridiculous! The handcuffed car chase is hysterical! I laughed so much during the last 10 minutes
- Charly walking away from the wreck, limbs in hand, big explosion — so funny
- The saw in the soundtrack is sci-fi spoopy.
- The prop gun still has the safety notch on it
- Wife decides that getting expert finger blasting is worth the safety of the kids
