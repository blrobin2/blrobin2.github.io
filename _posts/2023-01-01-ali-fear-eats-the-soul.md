**Rating:** 4/5

Postwar Germany loves to pretend that they’ve cleaned up their past, looking down on America whose white supremacist policies heavily influenced the Third Reich, but hate does not disappear, it only finds a more convincing costume to hide beneath

And what does that do to the person who must endure it — who is told it’s no big deal or a misunderstanding? What becomes of them?

Melodramatic, at times clunky and “very special episode”-esque, but plenty of beautiful moments throughout
