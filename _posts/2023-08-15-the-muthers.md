<blockquote><i>These aren't girls — they're pirates!</i></blockquote>
Cirio H. Santiago is one of the blaxploitation pioneers, this being one of the earliest films to star four black women — he also made his stunt folks take real hits and directed women with getting the breast bounce in the frame in mind— he <b>also</b> avoided the rape and torture scenes frequented in these women imprisonment flicks (but probably because audiences were over it by this point)

History's messy — that's all I'm saying

The movie is built entirely out of tropes but is well constructed, all things considered
