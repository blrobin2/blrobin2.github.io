The guy's name is Firehead because he can shoot lasers out of his eyes.

Jack Lemmon's son is in this, and he cannot help but emulate his father's mannerisms. As he is starring in Firehead, you can probably guess at his acting talent.

Christopher Plummer out-acts everyone with one of his hammiest performances.

I despise it when the Rifftrax dudes comment on how unattractive a woman is.

- Why is my sign in English?
- He's about to open a matryoshka doll of whoop ass. Well, and another smaller one, then another one, then another one, then the whoop ass.
- Damn it, Firehead! This time you've gone too far!
- Ivan's unpredictable — one minute, he's terrible, then next, he's great!
- Oh, Firehead, you watchman-murdering scamp!
- Gah! A nondescript sedan doing nothing!
- It’s so confusing, like there's a fire in my head, like I'm some kind of Firehead!
- Yeah, death rocks!
- So they vant a vorld var. Vhy?
- That was a truck-load of acting, Christopher.
- I love a guy with destructive superpowers waiting until the last second to use them.
- Johnny Two-Times on the phone there.
