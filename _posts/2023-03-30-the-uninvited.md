Brother and sister buy a seaside house that has “disturbances”. Though we see small things like flowers withering, they only begin to know something is wrong when they hear crying in the house, but cannot find anyone else in the house with them

The daughter of the original owner is distraught that the siblings bought the house, remembering her mother who died in the house

The brother and sister show little to no fear about a ghost being in their house. The brother is more upset that the daughter won’t run away with him because she believes the ghost is her mother

Things only become more complex from there, and a fine mystery unfolds. It makes some odd choices that undermine it’s tension — characters will resolve problems like Batman, just talking out loud and extrapolating swaths of information

Aesthetically, it has a lot going for it. Story-wise, it’s a bit of a mess. But it’s overall an easy-going watch

#### Stray Thoughts

- They call their dog stupid just like I call my cat
- Great lighting! Great use of shadow to unveil new images
- The ghost manifesting is pretty creepy!
- “I assure you when that healthy little man laughs he is not delirious,” the doctor says to a woman regarding her infant
