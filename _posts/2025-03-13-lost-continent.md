<blockquote><i>There is a wonderful moment in</i> The Lost Continent <i>that we failed to point out in our treatment of it. During the rock-climbing sequence, when they are hauling Sid Melton up onto a plateau by the butt, Hugh Beaumont is in the background, completely losing it. He's barely trying to cover the fact that he's laughing. Look for it; you'll not be disappointed.</i> — Michael J. Nelson, The MST3K Amazing Colossal Episode Guide</blockquote>
I can confirm that he's just laughing—it's so delightful. I like this episode so much!
