**Rating:** /5

Saffron is the symbol of sacrifice â€” always denying pleasure, comfort, and help, always in the service of others. Saffron is the symbol of purity. To undress is to unveil a guarded secret. Saffron is the symbol of celestial gifts. When we won't grant our desires, perhaps an invitation will arrive too good to deny.
