<i>Movie CW // Sexual Assault, Abuse, Misogyny
MST3K CW // Misogyny, Mental Illness, Transphobia, Fat phobia</i>

An extended take on The Ventriloquist's Dummy from <i>Dead of Night</i>, which is one of my favorite movies. This movie adds a mentalist angle. I like this — it’s dry, but it’s creepy!

- If not for rock and roll, ventriloquy would’ve been huge
- How many hours of rotary phones added to movies over the years?
- We’re looking live at the footlights
- You really had to make a commitment to read posters in those days
- — Your fee will be… — Nothing, just a bag of puppet chow
- I think I’ll have a vodka sandwich
- Why am I not smoking right now?
- Look familiar Mike — girls leaving you for ventriloquists?
