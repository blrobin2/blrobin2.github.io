Following up Into the Spider-Verse is a difficult task, considering it’s probably the most beloved Marvel movie they didn’t make. They certainly made it bigger — more references, more multiverse Spider-Men in different art styles, more movies

I loved the movie’s first act in Spider Gwen’s universe — the art style is so expressive, and the colors are so beautiful. Beyond that, I felt the movie get longer in parts than necessary and that nearly every set piece overstayed its welcome. They’re all good, it's just too much of it, especially when there’s a whole other movie of content coming next year

Overall, it’s still among the best comic book movies, it’s just that that bar is growing lower with each passing year
