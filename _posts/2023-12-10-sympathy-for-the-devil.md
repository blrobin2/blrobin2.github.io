**Rating:** 2/5

A guy drives with his son at night. He drops off his son at his grandmother’s and drives into Las Vegas. His wife calls, going into labor.

The driver pulls into the hospital parking lot. He sees a man with pink glowing hair. His blue eyes are daggers. Then, the man is in his car, pointing a gun at him.

The passenger tells him to drive. The driver tries to protest, but the gun says otherwise.

As they drive, the passenger knows the driver, or at least thinks he knows him. The passenger also believes that the driver is lying about who he is.

Cage is sweaty and unhinged, like I haven’t seen him in ages. Maybe it’s the Boston accent. The movie hinges on his performance, and there isn’t enough to carry 90 minutes. Still, it has its fun moments.

This movie is slooowwwww. The movie thinks it’s building tension, but the filmmakers don’t establish enough for it to be tense. So, after 15 minutes, it’s just watching and waiting for the revelation that puts it all together.

The reveal isn’t satisfying enough to justify the whole movie.
