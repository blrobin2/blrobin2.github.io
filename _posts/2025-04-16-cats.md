**Rating:** 0.5/5

* They're finally home to scoop my clumps!
* My cats only behave like this when they have intestinal parasites.
* Necromantical cats, raising cats from the dead!
* Is… is this cat sex?
* Bring back the Hayes Code!
* Oh good, I was afraid we wouldn't have to think about cockroach crotches.
* Yiffing and showing feet? Excuse me one second…
* — Look what the cat dragged in! — Oh, I get it! It's because they're cats.
* The movie is making DeviantArt of itself.
* Ooo, a cat!
* This music sounds like it came free with move-making software in 2003.
* Fine, so far as it goes, but is this really advancing the plot?
* Sega Dreamcast-ass-lookin diva
* I haven't seen a feline this upset since Paula Abdul dumped MC Scat Cat.
