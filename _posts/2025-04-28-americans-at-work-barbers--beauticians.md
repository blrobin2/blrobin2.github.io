<b>From Rifftrax Live: MST3K Reunion</b>

Jonah Ray and Joel Hodgson riffing

- Finally, a movie about clown thermometers? Finally!
- For more than six thousand years, the art of cutting hair has been practiced as a craft. Then, things got serious.
- So when you see a woman on the street, be sure to give her a shrill whistle and tell her to smile!
- Alright, it's your turn again.
- — Can I have a smoke, Dad? — You mean, "May I have a smoke?" And sure!
