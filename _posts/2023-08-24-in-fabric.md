Sheila purchases a dress from a witchy woman with anachronistic language usage. Then, bad things happen

Foregoing horror, the movie opts for the uncanny and weird, sometimes with humorous results. The movie reaches its logical ending about an hour in, so the film repeats its narrative with another person. It isn't a feature-length story

In addition to the repeat stories, we get scenes themed around the dress and its collection of sellers, but they don't inform much other than, "Yep, I was right! They're weirdos." For example, the frightening man masturbating to the witches fingering the mannequin on its period is... a lot

The soundtrack and audio are outstanding â€” if Peter Strickland has proven anything between this and<i> Berberian Sound Studio</i>, it's that he understands how to use sound effectively

Happy to see Gwendoline Christie in anything, but she has almost nothing to do here

I appreciate the mood the filmmakers chased after, but I don't think it lands, despite several flashes of compelling ideas
