**Rating:** 5/5

I was worried about Cronenberg returning to body horror as a sort of desperate attempt to win back his core fan base, but while this builds on concepts explored in earlier films — new flesh, surgical tools, organic technology — it makes its own statement about the nature of dysphoria and the performance of the body for the other

This might be my new favorite Cronenberg, but we’ll wait for the recency bias to wear off to confirm
