**Rating:** 1.5/5

* Hey, watch who you call “pervious”
* Socks and violence
* Dude, totally awesome job in there, really coming together as a group
* A beast so hideously expensive we couldn’t show it on screen
* Well you CAN just stand there, it’s possible
* Taking someone out of the sight of an omnipresent being is a difficult thing to do when you think about it
