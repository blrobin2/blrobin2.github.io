A woman sits in front of a mirror, putting on geisha makeup. A gorilla-like humanoid creature closes the partition and attacks. Blood splatters against the paper doors. 

<b>MANSTER.</b>

Dr. Robert Suzuki returns to his remote lab atop a volcanic mountain. His secretary Tara hands him a gun. He must handle Genji. The doctor enters the lab, passing Emiko, who resembles Sloth from the Goonies. She didn’t always look this way.

The doctor finds Genji hunched over — the creature who killed those women. The doctor shoots, killing Genji before throwing his failed experiment into the volcano incinerator.

Meanwhile, Larry Sanford, a foreign correspondent for World News, scales the same mountain. Before he can return home, his final assignment is to interview the reclusive Dr. Suzuki. 

Suzuki pours Larry an unusual liquor as they discuss cosmic rays and evolution. Larry grows weary and passes out. Dr. Suzuki has given Larry the elixir. It will work this time — he’s certain.

<b>MANSTER.</b>

This movie is hysterical. Every moment’s absurdity forgives script and performance weaknesses. It’s not good, but boy, is it a blast.


<b>*** Stray Thoughts/Spoilers ***</b>
* I watched a colorized copy of the movie because that’s what Prime had.
* Both Robert and Larry scale the volcano in nice suits. It’s not an easy climb.
* Robert immediately asks Larry if he’s fucked anybody while he’s in Tokyo. “I’ve been a good boy, if that’s what you’re asking.”
* Larry’s wife, Linda, is HORNY. She calls him often. “I have your picture, but it isn’t as good as the real thing.”
* Larry’s making out with Geishas and getting drunk on sake —  so much for being a good boy.
* Hot mineral baths with Tara. “Now I’ve seen everything, or I’m about to.”
* Uh oh! Linda shows up while Larry has Tara in his arms. His wife makes him choose, and he chooses Tara!
* The dude’s just killing everyone.
* Tara says, “I don’t care — any emotion I ever had was killed in me a long time ago.”
* He’s sprouting another head on his shoulders!
* Tara gives Robert a ritual blade. Is she telling him to kill himself?? He puts it down and grabs a gun instead.
* The colorizing process has a fit on the volcano.
* Woah, he became two entities!
* The fake volcano erupts in the background.
* Whelp, there goes Tara. So, I guess he chooses Linda after all.
