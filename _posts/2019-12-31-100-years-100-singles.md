There's no way a single song can represent an entire year. And yet, here I go, trying to find my favorite single from each year. Not the most important single, the best, or the most revolutionary: just one that I like. I focus on songs that were released as singles, so I can't pick some random B-side from an album I happened to like that year.

This is impossible, and I'm second guessing every choice. Oh well, here it is:
