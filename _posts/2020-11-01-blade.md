**Rating:** 2.5/5

This movie is BLUE 

Like a lot of action movies, they regularly sacrifice their own internal logic for the sake of big set pieces. There’s at least 30 minutes that could be cut, most of it exposition or redundant dialogue that does nothing to develop the plot

But Wesley Snipes is solid, Deacon Frost has good villain charisma despite having a terrible haircut
