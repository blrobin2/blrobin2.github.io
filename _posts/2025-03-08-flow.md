**Rating:** 3/5

This is the only animated movie I can recall watching where we got fixated on the tech used. It has a video game quality in how it chooses which assets to give higher fidelity, and the movie ends up feeling like a 90-minute cutscene.

I kept thinking about my black cat, and I got all teary-eyed. But there was a point where they put the cat through the same paces over and over, and I lost that emotional thread.

Without dialogue or any explicit themes beyond mutual aid, it's easy to apply whatever allegories or metaphors you want over it. I was also high as shit watching this, so who knows what deeper meanings I missed or misapplied.
