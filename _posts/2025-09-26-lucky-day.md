**Rating:** 2/5

Mary Jo Pehl and Bridget Jones Nelson riff on this one.

Amanda Donohoe! You know, from <i>Lair of the White Worm</i>? She responds to any information as though she's been told it'll be another 20 minutes before her table is ready.

Based on Mary Higgins Clark, so you know it's good.  Seriously, though, these soft TV mysteries are so cozy, even when it's basically <i>The Room</i>. That is, a dude with a bad accent and incredibly repetitive scenes.

The end credits song is a fuckin bop!

* Let's get out of here and go try on hats!
* That's exactly how an aspiring actress would set out the dip.
* Over-under on how many times they say "Bill is Missing" this movie?
* Don't yell in front of the spice rack!
* Brace yourself, Mavis Beacon.
* — It will be just a matter of time before she loses her life as well. — Well, he's not wrong.
* This is the perfect movie for people who find Matlock too fast-paced.
* Are you kidding? I can think of a million reasons to kill an old man.
* I have no idea what you're talking about, but I think I just invented gaslighting.
* I think you better thank Bill, or the guy who killed him.
* As an older and wiser cop once told me, don't date suspects.
