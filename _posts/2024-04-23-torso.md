Three people have sex with a doll between them. The man gouges the doll's eyes out. The camera shutter clicks while the film camera stays out of focus.

A professor discusses St. Sebastian in a beautiful church.

That night, a masked figure murders one student and her partner. He uses a knife to gouge out her eyes.

The students go to a party. One girl isn't having it and leaves two guys. They get on their bikes to pursue her into the woods. But there, she runs into the masked figure.

As students keep dying, the women in the class suspect it's someone in the class, perhaps the teacher himself.

The camera's leer as the killer is so uncomfortable! It makes me feel upset, which is impressive. Also, boobs come out for any reason. You could convince me Tinto Brass filmed this â€” a murderous Tinto Brass.

I prefer the original, more giallo title, "The Bodies Bear Traces of Carnal Violence." The theme is catchy as hell.

There's one scene in particular that is so prolonged and tense! It surprised me it worked, considering how long it is.

I don't know what to say. This movie influenced the slasher genre as an early giallo. Check it out!
