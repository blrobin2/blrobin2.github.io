The movie manages to be tense in a couple of places. The observatory chase is pretty fun!

- 12 angry teens
- court-appointed parents
- message from the governor: you're grounded
- just check off whether you want lethal injection or the chair
- [phone ringing] That means something, I know it!
- can't we just have a normal Thanksgiving where we drink and don't talk to each other?
- [stepping over several cigarette butts] did you have Rod Sterling over for dinner!
- being a war hero must've been really easy back then
- is she making a double-nintendo?
