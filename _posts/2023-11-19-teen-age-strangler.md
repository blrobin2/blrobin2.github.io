**Rating:** 1/5

They got Mike singing and doing characters, which fits him better. There are some truly offensive trans jokes this episode â€” the early 90s really couldn't help themselves, could they?

* What a busy night in downtown St. Paul
* Is this a teenager who strangles or someone who strangles teenagers?
* You're quite handsome. Can I touch your gun?
* Bored Straight
* Interrogation room and showers
* Leave Mikey alone! He's working on his novel!
