They got Mike singing and doing characters, which fits him better. There are some truly offensive trans jokes this episode â€” the early 90s really couldn't help themselves, could they?

- What a busy night in downtown St. Paul
- Is this a teenager who strangles or someone who strangles teenagers?
- You're quite handsome. Can I touch your gun?
- Bored Straight
- Interrogation room and showers
