**Rating:** 2/5

* So these were the Carter years…
* Sound by Hannah-Barbera
* Jack’s not getting paid enough to run
* It’s a wanton, unauthorized bris!
* Don’t rob me of my joy, Joe
* What kind of lure do you use to catch cocaine?
* Is that a Sears 12-piece suit, or is it from the Johnny Carson collection?
* They’re listening to one of those nature tapes
* (Jack Pallance Voice) Look, just take a Watchtower and read it!
