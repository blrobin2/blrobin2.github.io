<b><a href="https://boxd.it/pOK5i/detail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hooptober 7.0 | 24/32 | highest-rated horror film from the 50s that you haven't seen and can access</a></b>

<i>CW // Death, Suicide, Misogyny, Mental Illness</i>

We open at Stonehenge:

<blockquote><i>It has been written since the beginning of time, even onto these ancient stones, that evil, supernatural creatures exist in a world of darkness. And it is also said man, using the power of the ancient runic symbols, can call forth these powers of darkness — the demons of hell.</i></blockquote>Professor Harrington drives through the woods at night, speeding to the gates of Lufford Hall, the home of Dr. Julian Karswell. Harrington demands to see Karswell, to beg him to undo what he did. He promises Karswell to call off the press and the investigation to grant privacy to Karswell and his followers.

The clock strikes 9 PM. Karswell's face sinks, insisting he will do what he can but that Harrington should go home. Harrington, relieved, returns home. But before he enters his house, a billowing cloud of smoke hurdles towards him. The smoke coalesces and manifests as a demon. Harrington tries to drive away, but it is too late — the demon parts its mouth, unveiling its fangs.

Back at Lufford Hall, Karswell burns a newspaper, whose headline promises an exposé on Karswell's satanic cult at an international convention on paranormal psychology.

Dr. John Holden, a prominent psychologist, flies into London to attend the convention. Lloyd Williamson, personal aide to Professor Harrington, meets Holden at the gate. Williamson explains Harrington's bizarre death.

Holden joins Williamson and Professor O'Brien to pick up where Harrington left off on Karswell's cult. Holden does not believe in demons, but he may be the only one.

The movie explores the line between the scientific and the pseudoscientific.

The soundtrack gives me goosebumps — more still when it cuts out the soundtrack and lets the silence accumulate

The cinematography is sharp and builds tension. It creates a sense of isolation at times and the feeling of an unknowable presence at others.

The film commits to a dramatic irony where we know that demons are real (or are they???). So, we watch Holden's rational superstition to see what would change his mind. Meanwhile, we share experiences of spiritualism and other similar beliefs, and the movie is more ambiguous about their truth.

Niall MacGinnis has such an unusual energy — he has the perfect demeanor of a villain who always has the upper hand.

The demon manifesting special effects are incredible — billowing smoke adds an unknowability to its pattern, adding suspense to if and when it shows up.

Love, love, love the climax!

#### Stray Thoughts / Spoilers

- The amount of space they had on the plane is truly astonishing. Holden could almost go horizontal in his seat without bothering the person behind him
- I love the niece chastising Holden for mansplaining psychology to her
- Greymalken the cat is perfect
- The footprints!!
- Sure, they're going to bring this guy out of catatonia with meth
- That demon rips him to shreds! (to shreds, you say?)
