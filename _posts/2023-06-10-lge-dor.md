**Rating:** 4.5/5

The church won’t let them fuck, so they shit and kiss and suck on statues and throw shit out windows. In the end, Jesus emerges from the orgy castle from 120 Says of Sodom

It’s fine — I mostly like how many people it pissed off

Fuck Salvador Dalí! He tried to get Buñuel to tone this down so it wouldn’t upset Dalí’s fascist friends. Buñuel made it without Dalí, and then Dalí decried the movie as propaganda against the Catholic Church, inspiring anti-Jewish groups to riot at screenings
