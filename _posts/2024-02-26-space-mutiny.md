**Rating:** /5

<i>Movie CW // Violence, Murder, Blood, Misogyny
MST3K CW // Misogyny, Homophobia, Transphobia, Ageism, Eating Disorders, Body Shaming</i>

And so begins perhaps the best run of movies on the show: <i>Space Mutiny</i>, <i>Time Chasers</i>, and <i>Overdrawn at the Memory Bank</i>.

I would watch this movie outside of <i>MST3K</i>. The exterior shots are all from the original <i>Battlestar Galactica</i>.

* We've got some Benedictine monks in the floorboards, unfortunately
* Thick McRunfast
* Open fire on Blitzen
* How dare you insult my knowledge of ancient dentistry?
* — Hey you! — You mean me or my familiar?
* Ow, my mask!
