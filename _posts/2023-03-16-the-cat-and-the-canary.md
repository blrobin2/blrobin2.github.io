**Rating:** 3.5/5

I’m gonna end up watching all the <i>The Cat & the Canary </i>adaptations, aren’t I?

Bob Hope injects his sense of humor by being the character who has been in these sorts of radio plays before, so he is able to predict everything that happens. His jokes are so rushed sometimes that it feels like he’s trying to riff on the movie he’s in a la Mystery Science Theater. It’s exhausting at first, but I got used to it

As I’m watching, I realize how much David Hyde Pierce is influenced by Bob Hope’s physical mannerisms, particularly in Fraiser

This one has some long shadows, but nowhere near the atmosphere, leaning more into the comedy than the horror this time around

Also, it doesn’t really change up the core story or even the scenes, so it was fairly straightforward

Still, it’s a creepy house with secrets so I’m into it

Oh and great cat!
