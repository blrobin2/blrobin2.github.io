**Rating:** 1/5

* Oh, something suburban is attacking them! I don't know what it is, but it's definitely not urban or rural!
* Bass Pro Shop endorsement, is that you?
* Sorry, kid, there's a new shopping area, so I gotta kill you.
* Lot's wife refused to investigate Sasquatch, and look what happened to her!
* How come Spielberg never used a purple vortex scene transition?
* I went to heaven and there were hot dogs everywhere.
* I'll never give up on my quest to eat Sasquatch.
* But Coily the Spring Sprite turned all the springs into pipes!
