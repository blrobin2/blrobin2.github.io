* Love the reflective pool title cards
* Dance flip book!
* Love the Art Deco stage sets!
* The record skip
* Slap That Bass in the Art Deco ship interior
* Ginger Rogers is so iconic
* Fred Astaire can eat my shorts
* Let's Call The Whole Thing Off on roller skates, with the pratfall at the end!
* The mask serenade is so off-putting but I'm glad it worked for Linda?
* So many gay men!
