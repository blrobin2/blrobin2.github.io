**Rating:** 3/5

Some cool visuals — and some really dull ones — and some ideas that could be fleshed out into something good, but this one seems to default on building it out with pastiche to other directors of this ilk

I haven’t seen <i>Antiviral</i>, but with this and <i>Possessor</i>, I haven’t been excited by his work. Glad to see something weird in theaters, though

Also, if the unrated version doesn’t hang more brain, I will kill myself
