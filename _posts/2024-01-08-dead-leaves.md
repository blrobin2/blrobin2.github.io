Two cyborgs wake up on Earth with no memories. They react just like anyone else would in that situation. They go on a crime spree. The cops catch them and send them to a moon prison called Dead Leaves.

The manic art style is fascinating, but the characters, story, pacing, and pretty much everything else are deeply uninteresting to me.

Then again, I’m not the target audience. This is for 14-year-old boys.

I don’t mean to be mean. It just isn’t for me.
