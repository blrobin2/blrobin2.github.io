**Rating:** 4.5/5

Every frame of this looks like a woodblock print. It’s also pretty fucked up, real unscrupulous dudes get what’s coming to them!

The part where he keeps stabbing at ghosts and is accidentally stabbing people turns funny after like 3 times

The more surreal the movie gets, the better
