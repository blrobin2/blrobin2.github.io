**Rating:** 2/5

While I appreciate the dedication to realism by loading it up with commercials (at least half of the runtime...), it’s exhausting trying to determine which are just jokes and which are clues/plot pieces (spoiler alert: they’re all jokes). For a version of this that works, see 1992’s Ghostwatch
