<b>It's <i>Harold and Maude</i>, but without all the stuff</b>

In a world of mirrors and duplicity, Ben Gottlieb works through the grief of losing his wife and his singing voice. In his silence, his loved ones rise to speak on his behalf — perhaps they can help recreate the image of what he lost. But it's only when he works with Carla Kessler, a 70-year-old woman who wants to finally have her bat mitzvah, that he learns how to speak for himself.

Ben is the sort of schmuck for schmucks — his grief is a selfish beast that toys with the people in his life while he uses them to get what he wants. The film is no one's story but his, and so even the proverbial love interest is a projection — her pain is his mirror to find himself in, and her desires are only granted in the most rote way.

In that sense, I appreciate the film's earnest presentation. But I had a difficult time connecting with it on an emotional level. Still, the comedy is solid and the filmmaking is artful and intentional. I'm glad I got to see it in the world's smallest movie theater.
