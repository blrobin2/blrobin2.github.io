<b><a href="https://boxd.it/pOK5i/detail" rel="nofollow">Hooptober 7.0 | 14/32 | 2nd film in franchise 6/7 | Decades 5/6 | 1990s</a></b>

Five years after the events of <i>The Slumber Party Massacre</i> (and kinda sort of <i>Sorority House Massacre</i>), five women buy the same sorority house. They stay overnight to meet the movers and begin renovating in the morning.

Janey waits until they move in to disclose that this is the old Hochstatter place with several gruesome murders. How else could they acquire the place at such a low cost?

Lighting strikes — a storm comes that night, knocking out the power. Their neighbor, Orville Ketchum, comes over and tells them about finding the bodies and Hochstatter's death. He reaches into his pants, appearing ready to reveal his penis, but instead produces a basement key.

They go to the basement like the Scooby Gang, finding Hochstatter's tools and an Ouija board. After multiple shower and clothes-changing scenes, the women gather around the Ouija board in their lingerie. They take shots and try to contact Hochstatter's ghost. The planchette flies off into the fire.

Janey goes downstairs for a shot when a figure in black grabs her. The shadow of a hook descends — a cartoonish volume of blood sprays all over the kitchen walls. Suzanne goes looking for Janey. Her foot gets caught in a bear trap.

Who's doing this? Is it Orville? Hochstatter's ghost? A third thing??

Unlike <i>Sorority House Massacre</i> and <i>The Slumber Party Massacre</i>, women did not write and direct this movie. Directed by Jim Wynorski of <i>Cleavagefield</i>, <i>The Bare Wench Project</i>, and <i>Para-Knockers Activities</i> fame, this movie recycles <i>Slumber Party</i> footage and distorts the space-time continuum. I get it. The giant drill footage is more outrageous than anything in <i>Sorority House</i> or, sadly, this movie.

It honestly doesn't matter. It's one of the rare cases where not watching any of the prior films will make this easier to understand.

This movie leans hard into parody, making several winking references to slasher tropes.

The movie knows exactly what it is, so it's easy-going and fun. It loses steam once it goes full slasher but doesn't implode.
