James Miller (William Shimell), author of Certified Copy, is running late for a book reading and signing in Tuscany, Italy.

James says that he got the idea of the book Florence. He writes about how art forgeries can lead to appreciating the original. The original work of art achieves merit by certifying its authenticity. We should grant the same process for and graces to the copies. A cell phone call interrupts him.

Juliette Binoche (credited as She) and her son arrive late to the reading. She invites James to her place to see her gallery of forgeries. James isn’t interested, so she drives him to Lucignano for coffee. They share stories, jokes, and various musings, all spoken in English.

At the coffee shop, James steps outside to answer another call. The Cafe Owner talks with her about marriage and time. She says all her husband cares about is himself and his job and that they’ve been married for 15 years, insinuating that it’s James.

As they leave the cafe, she and James speak in French, and the tone and trajectory of the movie changes.

The film is like the <i>Before</i> movies because it focuses on one day together. This film has ulterior motives. It doesn’t want you to know about them until it happens.

A wedding anniversary in a city overrun with brides and grooms — photographers setting up the lights and couples practicing smiles for the pictures. Brides lined up for photos. Some are happy, some are sad. One bride in the background of a shot puts drops in her eyes so that she appears to be crying.

Echoes of love — its hopeful beginnings, its forgetful middles, and its shambling endings. The tolerated quirks from early on become the start of every fight. Memories they thought they shared become disputes about who is right.

Love and its happiness aren’t about whose memories are correct. It’s allowing both copies to exist and to grant authenticity to both.

I got more out of thinking about this instead of watching it. The movie is still compelling.
