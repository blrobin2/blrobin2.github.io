**Rating:** 2.5/5

Joel's cut his long hair! He's looking like the Joel I know (aka slightly less of a massive pothead).

This is the final Gamera episode of the KTMA era. Dr. Forrester suggests that Joel's rockets are powered by ratings, so if their jokes aren't good, then their ship will crash. I don't know if that carries into the official show, but I like the idea.

This movie has the worst dubbing I've ever seen. It's so scattered. But the spaceship effects rule, especially with the VHS scanlines and color distortions.

* Kid's say the darnedest things. Did you know that?
* — How can I make mom understand? — Psst, the telescope, over there
* Wake up, or I'm dying
* People from the future are so smug. Did you know that?
