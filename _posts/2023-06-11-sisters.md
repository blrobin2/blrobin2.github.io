A 2006 remake of De Palma’s <i>Sisters</i> because “everyone else is doing Hitchcock remakes, why not do a Hitchcock knock-off remake?”

Thankfully, unlike, say, Van Sant’s <i>Psycho</i> remake, this tries to approach the story from a new angle, looking for an empathetic treatment of the sisters as well as a more coherent way to arrive at the climax (including a belabored relationship to hidden cameras)

The movie spends most of its time with the story beats from the first 20-30 minutes of the original, so the journey for Sevigny‘s character takes a sharper turn, requiring a pile of flashbacks and onscreen text to justify itself

Music queues are way over-the-top — someone waking up to a jump scare sting? Just have zero confidence in the film

Pretty rote, uninspired filmmaking otherwise

#### Stray Thoughts:</b>

- Call from A!? What is this, Pretty Little Liars?
- The most useless cops (redundant, I know)
- The most unnecessary breast shot in a movie, literally a 2-second flashback of Sevigny in the bath
