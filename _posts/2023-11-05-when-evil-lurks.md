This movie is only about demon possession because they call the monstrous thing a demon. But it's a zombie flick. Something called "rotten" births some unspeakable evil if you kill it. In the meantime, it spreads through (?) to people all over town, driving them to disperse it, and so on.

We get regular stops to talk and introduce new rules about demons, evil, how to avoid them, how to find them, etc. Over and over, the movie grinds to a halt to explain something. Throughout the movie, you must know the new rule before the next scary thing happens. And then the movie ends, and none of it has any weight on what happened to the characters.

This movie is vague enough about its themes that you can choose whichever one you want. I’ve seen reviews say the possession is a metaphor for COVID, toxic masculinity, depression, immigration... you get the picture.

Solid gore, decent scares, and twists, but this is far from the masterpiece that folks sold to me. It's a mean, bleak little horror movie — let it be that.
