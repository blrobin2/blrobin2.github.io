**Rating:** 1.5/5

Despite my better judgment (and because of my completionist tendencies), I'm giving the <i>MST3K</i> reboot a shot

TV's son of TV's Frank is funny

* Bones. Jim. Fossil bones? Fossil Jim?
* Now you're Mr Filing Cabinet
* Fire in the aquarium? That'll sort itself out
* — Dr. Darby? — No, these are just glasses, Dr. Darby was much taller 
* What about shooting him? I mean REALLY shooting him?
