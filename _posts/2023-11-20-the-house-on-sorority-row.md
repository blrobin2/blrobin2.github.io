<b>Stray Thoughts</b>
* The most Chekov of guns
* Everyone goes around and gives an exposition toast. It works for me!
* Tearing the waterbed seems like it would cause significant water damage to the house.
* Oh, this is <i>I Know What You Did Last Summer</i>.
* The house band is pretty good! Richard Band, I think?
* Sedative dream sequence — killer light, totally wild vibes
* Great ending! Tense and well-paced
