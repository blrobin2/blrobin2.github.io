<b>Stray Thoughts</b>

- The most Chekov of guns
- Everyone goes around and gives an exposition toast. It works for me!
- Tearing the waterbed seems like it would cause significant water damage to the house.
- Oh, this is <i>I Know What You Did Last Summer</i>.
- The house band is pretty good! Richard Band, I think?
- Sedative dream sequence — killer light, totally wild vibes
- Great ending! Tense and well-paced
