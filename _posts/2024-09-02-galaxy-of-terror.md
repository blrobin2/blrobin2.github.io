#### Stray Thoughts / Spoilers

- The second the New World Pictures logo came up with the hand-drawn lasers, I knew I'd at least enjoy the movie's effects
- It's wild that James Cameron worked on an Alien rip-off before directing Aliens
- What's up, pre-Freddy Robert Englund?
- Grace Zabriskie is so chaotic â€” this might be the youngest I've seen her
- The slurping sound effect is _chefs kiss_
- The Solaris-like elements are pretty sweet
- The giant maggot, SA-ing someone to death, is pretty fucked up
