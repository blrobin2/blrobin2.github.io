**Rating:** 2.5/5

<b>*** Stray Thoughts / Spoilers ***</b>
* The second the New World Pictures logo came up with the hand-drawn lasers, I knew I'd at least enjoy the movie's effects
* It's wild that James Cameron worked on an Alien rip-off before directing Aliens
* What's up, pre-Freddy Robert Englund?
* Grace Zabriskie is so chaotic â€” this might be the youngest I've seen her
* The slurping sound effect is *chefs kiss*
* The Solaris-like elements are pretty sweet
* The giant maggot, SA-ing someone to death, is pretty fucked up
