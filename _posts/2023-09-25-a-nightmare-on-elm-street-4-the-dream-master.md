<blockquote><i>When deep sleep falleth on men, fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake
</i><i>— Job 4:13-14</i></blockquote>Despite (spoiler alert) Freddy dying in the 3rd movie, this movie keeps with the logic of the franchise and says, "No ❤️"
<blockquote><i>You shouldn't have buried me. I'm not dead</i></blockquote>Tuesday Knight replaces Patricia Arquette as Kristen, calling the Dream Warriors into her dreams to tell them Krueger is back. When dog Jason pees fire onto Krueger's grave, that somehow brings Krueger back

Kristen pulls Alice in by mistake, passing something to Alice. As each person around her dies, she collects something from them psychically. Alice keeps talking about The Dream Master — someone you can summon with a rhyme

Alice's disassociated fantasies are so relatable — talking to the boy she's too shy to say anything to, yelling down her emotionally abusive father

The soundtrack rules:

- Divinyls - Back to the Wall
- Dramarama - Anything, Anything
- Billy Idol - Fatal Charm
- Sinead O'Connor - I Want Your (Hands on Me)

This one has some of the wildest effects and greatest set pieces so far:

- Krueger rematerializing
- The model swimming in the waterbed
- Sucking out that girl's soul
- The people meatballs
- The barbell/cockroach scene — fucking insane — my face was twisted in disgust the whole time
- The car wreck
- Krueger in the mirror and the retint body horror

This is the movie that turns Freddy Krueger into the catchphrase, "bitch"-obsessed moron that haunts pop culture. I like the creativity of the effects and sets, but I despise the Krueger character

I should rate this lower, but the creative effects are unparalleled in any of the mainstream slasher franchises
