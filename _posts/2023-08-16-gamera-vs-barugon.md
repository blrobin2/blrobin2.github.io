**Rating:** 1.5/5

* Gamera. Bill Gamera
* I'll shoot myself to prove we're friendly
* Death, where is thy sting? We're waiting
* Oh no it's Barugon! Boy, could he kiss!
* That's right, don't try to understand him. Just rope and throw and brand him
* Where's Gamera? He got top billing! He must have a really good agent
* Hey Joel, when you went to the drive-in, did you spend a lot of time in the trunk?
