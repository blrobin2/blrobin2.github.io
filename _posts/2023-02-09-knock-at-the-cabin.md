**Rating:** 3/5

Shyamalan takes a compelling idea and squashes out the ambiguity in favor of apocalyptic Christian pornography. I don’t think he meant to, he just has his proclivities as a filmmaker that he will never deny, movie be damned. Which also means that you know exactly how at least 3/4 of this movie will go if you’ve seen one of his movies before

That said, the performances were great, the cinematography was satisfyingly off-putting, it was fairly well-paced despite knowing it’s trajectory, and it was even tense a couple of times when it didn’t neuter the tension for flashbacks that added surprisingly little to the narrative

Overall, it’s a classic Shyamalan flick: bad, but in an interesting way
