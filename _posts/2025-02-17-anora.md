Mikey Madison is the movie. Even though her character is barely a sketch, she brings a lot with her performance.

With how much skin this movie shows, it's disappointing, bordering on worrying that they didn't hire an intimacy coordinator.

An 85-minute cut of this movie would have been a riot. We could have gotten to the last 10-15 minutes so much quicker for the same (earned) payoff.

Still, this movie has a lot going for it, and I was engaged for most of it.

When Patricia realized this movie was from the same director as <i>The Florida Project</i>, she actually left the house. She hates <i>The Florida Project</i>.
