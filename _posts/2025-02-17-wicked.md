**Rating:** 3/5

Cynthia Erivo deserves the world. I've been an Ariana Grande fan, for better or worse. Michelle Yeoh. Enough said.

I am happy for the Kristin Chenoweth and Idina Menzel cameos.

Jeff Goldblum is good at The Wizard but shouldn't be in a musical.

Can digital not recreate the lushness of technicolor?

The cinematography isn't a satisfying match for a musical. The film has many set pieces that are blink-and-you-miss-it with the chronic cutting and movement. I guess it's more aesthetically pleasing than <i>The Wiz</i>'s static blandness.

How did they put half the musical in the same runtime as the stage version?

I've always had a soft spot for <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>, so despite my misgivings about this movie, I enjoyed being in the world.

Oh, and Defying Gravity still hits
