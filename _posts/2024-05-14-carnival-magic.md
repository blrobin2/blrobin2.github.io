**Rating:** 1.5/5

Mark Hamill shows up and does a slightly less horrifying Joker voice

* That's Alex, my beautiful son
* — Reach inside — Ew, of what?
* What stage of grief is playing with chimps?
* I'm sitcom mad!
* The classic stereotype of a greedy chimp 
* The power of Gus compels me
* Back to whipping cats in an empty tent
* Gah damn tiger shot me!
* I reject your all-encompassing love!
