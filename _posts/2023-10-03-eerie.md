Rumors haunt the halls of an all-girls Catholic school — abusive Mothers, suicidal girls. When one girl dies a gruesome death, guidance counselor Pat Consolacion tries to help the girls cope and possibly solve the mystery of who (or what) killed the girl

We soon learn that Pat has an unusual ability: she can commune with the dead. And so, she comes to know Eri, a deceased student who has watched over the school

The film deals with believing in god when the world is cruel and violent. Pat believes that in the absence of god, we must step in to help one another. Another nun at the school thinks that corporal punishment is the only thing that will help these kids

The movie has jump scares, but it’s not particularly scary. Some of the imagery is intense and gory, though, so it can be hard to watch for that reason

I appreciate the ideas at play here, and I think the movie is overall well put together — I don’t think it has much to help it stand out beyond being from the Philippines
