**Rating:** 5/5

Canned pineapples or chef’s salad, one song or another,  someone you just met or someone who works at your favorite snack bar — love or distraction, does it really matter? Things are going to change anyways. But change takes time, and fixations don’t just go away. What if they feel the same way? What if they don’t? What if they never come back? What if they do?
