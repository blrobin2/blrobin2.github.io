**Rating:** 2/5

I saw Aja’s remake of <i>The Hills Have Eyes</i> in high school, and it was the first time I had seen a movie that violent — the first half felt so over-the-top I couldn’t process what I was experiencing — and the first time I felt that sense of vindication and cheering for violence during the second-half revenge. I anticipated something akin to that in this movie

Cecile de France is on a trip to visit Maiwenn’s family. Maiwenn fixated on a taken boy, de France on Maiwenn, fingering herself to reggae — the sexiest genre — while the camera takes turns looking at all of the sleeping family members who will inevitably be murdered

Somewhere in the background is a trucker who likes to auto-fellate employing a decapitated head, who pulls up to the house unprovoked, ringing the bell with his oily hands and initiating his spree

A taut movie up to a point (see spoilers below for an explanation), and once that point happens, it is dumb as hell

Is it gory? Yeah, dude, it’s gory. Is it sub-90 minutes? Hell yeah, it is. Is it worth seeing? Not really


<b>***SPOILERS***</b>
If the opening dream sequence isn’t a dead giveaway, there is a twist that… doesn’t work. Logistically, it doesn’t make any sense. The filmmakers would be better off just letting it be some dude and sticking closer to the revenge film formula instead of trying to upturn it as carelessly as this
