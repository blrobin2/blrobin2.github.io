As I said in my Evil Dead remake review, I don’t have a strong tie to the original movies, so there’s nothing precious about them that this movie could sully

Compared to the remake, this is a more chaotic and fun experience. It retains the remake’s gore and viscera but tries much harder to develop characters and themes. They’re not vibrant characters, and it’s not a subtle theme — if I can’t care for these kids, can I be a good mother? — but it allows the movie to have a shape

Pacing-wise, it’s hit-or-miss. It never builds off its previous scare, so it doesn’t have the original’s relentlessness. But I liked that? The originals got exhausting in a way this one avoided

I also liked how the book was discovered, and the demon summoned

Overall, not bad, very gross, and so on
