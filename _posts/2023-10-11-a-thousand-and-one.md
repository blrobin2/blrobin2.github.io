Inez (Teyana Taylor) is living at the shelter again. She finds Terry on the corner. She tells him she’s his mother and that she’s going to be around now.

After a head injury, Terry ends up in the hospital. Inez comes to visit but tells him she has to let him go back to foster care.

<blockquote><i>Why do you keep leaving me?</i></blockquote>
Inez offers him a chance to come with her for a few days. Days turn into years as they find a place to live. Inez gets some fake papers for Terry, so the foster care system can’t find them.
<blockquote><i>There’s more to life than fucked-up beginnings</i></blockquote>

Inez invites Lucky, a long-time on-and-off-again boy, to live with her and Terry. As Terry grows up, Lucky becomes a father figure.

As the years go on, things get more complex for them. But Terry is bright and intelligent. Maybe he can break the cycle and get out of his neighborhood.

The advertising for this movie is horrendous. This film may seem arthouse, but it’s a captivating, accessible mainstream movie.

We meet Terry at three ages. Each actor does a great job bringing out a different aspect of Terry. Watching that growth is one of the most rewarding parts of this movie.

The film delves into the complex relationship between Inez and Terry, exploring the impact of their individual traumatic experiences. The film also explores gentrification and systemic issues, showing how even good intentions can backfire.

This is a solid debut film from A.V. Rockwell. I hope the recognition critics are giving this presents more opportunities for her.
