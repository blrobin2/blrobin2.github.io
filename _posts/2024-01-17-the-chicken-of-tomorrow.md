- Dedicated to the chicken who lost their lives in the great war
- These are your chickens on drugs
- My fellow Poultrymen, our cherished freedoms are challenged on all sides
- Time to die
- Room for thousands of guests, mostly chickens
- Put your mouth under a chicken
- Lick your eggs, or have a friend lick them!
- Some eggs don't even exist
- These chickens were smoking in bed
- Did America really need to be sold on the automotive industry at this point?
