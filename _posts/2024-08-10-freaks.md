I watched this movie at a movie night with some folks. It's just so half-cooked and not considered. It gets points for not doing too much info-dumping in its world-building. Lexy Kolker is the best actor in the movie at 9. But there is a point in the film where we know exactly where the movie is going. And it's so tedious waiting for it to get there. I stepped out to take a 20-minute phone call. When I returned, I immediately knew what was happening and where everyone was.

Most folks I watched this with liked it, so I'm not the target audience. Your mileage may vary.
