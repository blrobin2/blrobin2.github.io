<b>Northern California, 1980s</b>
Four sasquatches fuck and vibe. They try to find others of their kind but have no luck. As the seasons change and the dangers of the forest emerge, the group faces changes in their dynamic and the fate of their species.

The film has no comprehensible dialogue or subtitles — no guidance through this world. Not that the movie needs it — it's worth knowing beforehand.

Initially, the movie is about bodily fluids: piss, shit, puke, breast milk, and so on. We see how much like animals the sasquaches are.

I liked how it depicts their unassuming intelligence — the rituals, the artistic expressions, and the neuroses.

Ultimately, the movie explores human intervention and how humans, intentionally or otherwise, affect the Sasquatch

The movie initially annoyed me, but as it unveiled its intentions, I softened to it. Hell, a couple of jokes made me laugh. And, somehow, despite the odds, one scene managed to move me.

The movie is bold as hell, and I'm surprised it's getting mainstream distribution. The performances are what they need to be (except for Jesse Eisenberg, who sounded and acted like himself and broke the illusion). It doesn't totally work for me, but I came out happy to have seen it.
