Jake Gyllenhaal is a man trying to play two roles — the man who is married and the man who is having an affair. He is trying to figure out which one is the life that he wants. In the undeciphered chaos of his mind, he knows that one will overtake the other, but he is afraid of what is lost. But even when he thinks he’s made up his mind, the cycle begins again, and he has become hostage to something that he doesn’t understand about himself

This movie is the same color as NYC skies right now — a jaundiced yellow that puts Soderbergh’s shite color grading to shame

This movie is pretty funny in an uncanny sort of way — I feel like the filmmaking doesn’t let you know you’re allowed (supposed?) to laugh. Like Gyllenhaal says some ridiculous things

I wonder how much of the book has all of these elements. Regardless, the film feels like a fully realized concept, with just enough at the edge to keep you thinking

#### Spoilers\_\*\*</b>

The tarantula is subconscious desire — a thing that can feel small and kept under your heel like a dictator or a sudden monster whom you may not realize has overpowered you

At least, that’s my theory! It could also just be a scary thing to have in a movie ¯\_(ツ)\_/¯
