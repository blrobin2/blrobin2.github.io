<b><i>Black Swan</i> for boys — queer longing for straights</b>

<i>Whiplash</i> is a sadomasochist romance in which a kid learns to bleed at tempo for his chosen daddy. I'd love to see what David Cronenberg would do with this material.

<a href="https://youtu.be/t8-uoTD4fMQ?si=sgfjCAcs64Ck-Glu" rel="nofollow">Buddy Rich was a total asshole</a>. Benny Goodman was a complete shithead. JK Simmons turns the stories of their abuse into caricatures. For an example of how to pull off this repressed violence, see <i>Beau Travail.</i>
