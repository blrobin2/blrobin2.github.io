In her first American film, Audrey Hepburn is Princess Ann, who is on a goodwill tour of Europe to solidify her royal family's relationships with the Western European nations. We join her at her country's embassy that evening at a formal reception and ball given in her honor.

By all appearances, she is unphased by the laborious tour and the countless aristocrats with whom she has met. But we get a small glimpse as she pulls her foot out of her heel and stretches.

While Ann lies in bed, her assistant goes over the following day's events. Ann snaps and cries. They send for a doctor to make sure she is calm. The doctor gives her a sedative and suggests "she do what she pleases for a while."

Once everyone leaves, Ann gets dressed and slips out, hiding in a delivery truck.

Meanwhile, an American reporter named Joe (Gregory Peck) leaves a poker game to get some sleep before meeting the princess tomorrow. He comes across Ann asleep on a park bench. He doesn't recognize her as the princess and thinks she's drunk. Joe tries to get her a taxi, but when she gives the correct address, he assumes Ann is confused. After much hassle and confusion, Joe brings her to his place to sleep off the alcohol.

Joe wakes up late the next day for his interview. He rushes to work, only to hear that the princess is ill. He looks at the newspaper, and the picture looks awfully familiar. Joe suggests to his boss that he can land an exclusive interview with the princess. The princess, however, has different plans.

<blockquote><i>— Don't you have to work?
— Work? No! Today's a holiday.</i></blockquote>Both Peck and Hepburn are charming and funny. They have fantastic chemistry.

The camera finds all the perfect angles. It never feels composed. It feels like perfect timing.

The film has a laid-back, breeze pace. Nothing happens quickly. Even with police involvement, the stakes remain low.

This movie is the foundation for the contemporary romantic comedy, complete with innuendos, manipulation, and misunderstandings.

Most of the "tourism rom-coms" that followed did little riffing on this formula. The romance developed so organically that it completely took me in.

This movie is such a genuine delight. What an achievement! Can William Wyler do any wrong? Between this and <i>The Heiress</i>, he keeps exceeding my expectations.

<blockquote><i>— Rome. By all means, Rome. I will cherish my visit here in memory as long as I live.</i></blockquote><b>***Stray Thoughts / Spoilers***</b>
* This movie is the first Audrey Hepburn film I've seen as an adult. She's entirely too pretty.
* Her haircut stressed me out!!
* Peck is so creepy when he takes the camera from the little girl.
* Irving's cigarette lighter camera is nifty.
* This movie made the Vespa in Rome iconic, used most effectively in the modern classic <i>The Lizzie McGuire Movie</i>.
* The "bored princess who wants to have fun" trope is also a Disney staple.
* A kiss for Joe and a handshake for Irving
* It's bold of Joe to beat up the plainclothes agents.
* The guitar on the head — iconic!
* LITTLE CAT AT THE DOCKS!
* Wow, did their kiss make me swoon??
* I am crying! I know they must say goodbye, and it breaks my little heart.
* Joe is too mean to Irving.
* The press meeting is perfect. Peck's eyes epitomize bittersweetness. Hepburn too!
* Irving giving her the photos is so sweet.
* I'M SO GLAD THIS DOESN'T HAVE THE MISUNDERSTANDING FIGHT. I was worried about that.
