**Rating:** 3/5

<blockquote><i>We kill men… It is obvious. There’s not much to say</i></blockquote>Thomas freeloads about, meeting up with his old fling Peggy and staying with her and her roommates for a bit

Unbeknownst to him, the women are a radical political group who build bombs to cause chaos and kill any man they’ve been when for longer than five days, just in case

The movie is quiet and meandering, and the end sequence is slack. From what I read, the film satirizes political groups of its time, including one that actress Uschi Obermaier was once a part of, but even with that knowledge, I still feel out of the loop on what the movie is trying to accomplish

The acting is decent, the concept is interesting enough, and it is easy to watch — maybe give it a whirl if you know about late-60s political movements in Germany

<b>Stray Thoughts</b>
* people just drive into bodies of water in these movies
* “You need to watch a vampire move” — when the guy says he’s spoiled, why would they hurt him?
