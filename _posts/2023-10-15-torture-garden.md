Dr. Diablo (Burgess Meredith) has a fairground sideshow called The Torture Garden. Within, he shows off different torture implements, one on a living human being. For a small fee, he will show you "real" torture. Five guests step through and experience visions.

<b>Enoch</b>

A man presses his dying uncle for a cut of his inheritance. The uncle dies, swearing he does not have one, but when the man finds a hidden basement with a coffin, he discovers a secret he would regret knowing.

<b>Terror Over Hollywood</b>

A duplicitous woman edges her way into a date that grants her access to a famous actor. She gets her wish, but her curiosity gets the best of her when one of her coworkers survives a gunshot wound to the head.

<b>Mr. Steinway</b>

A pianist's playing suffers when he dates someone new. His girlfriend asks him to choose between his piano career and her, but the choice is not up to him.

<b>The Man Who Collected Poe</b>

A man who collects Poe meets a collector who has several first editions and even unpublished works of Poe. The two become friends, but the man cannot bear to only look at these prizes.

I would usually give each story a review, but they are all similarly dopey and fun. They play more like parables than horror stories, where the person experiencing the vision demands answers to dark secrets.

The film is a silly but consistent horror anthology, perfect for a hungover Saturday.
