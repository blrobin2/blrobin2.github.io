- Can't believe dad wanted a tombstone with the F-word on it so many times.
- Wait a minute, is that Bernie of "Weekend at" fame?
- These sweet leather gloves are the only salvation I need!
- Jeff Dunham puppet! Oh, phew, it's just a rotting corpse.
- My diary has a key — that's where I keep the dreams I get from the rainbow princess.
- Yet another door I like more than Jim Morrison.
- The bed bugs in this couch have left a colony in my ear. It tickles, hehe!
- Ah yeah, waking up in a strange house, hammering sounds nearby—it's like the time I got roofied by Bob Villa.
- This place is boarded up pretty solid now, windows right behind me notwithstanding.
- — How can you smile at a time like this? — Dianetics :)
- — I ought to drag you off and feed you to those things! — I'm always yelling that to the sack of bird seed I keep in my garage.
