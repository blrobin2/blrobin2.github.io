Starting your biopic with a dude flying is a choice, it took me a while after that to get my bearings

Maybe the only acceptable portrayal of Jesus as a white dude since the story is displaced to Russia? “If Jesus came back, we would crucify him again”

The raid is so well done, the scale and coordination of it all truly made my jaw drop. Although the horse violence was a huge bummer

The forging of the bell and bringing it to the city has big Herzog energy, I’d fully believe the actually followed a traditional bell-making method

Having only watched his later films, I didn’t know what an historical biopic by Tarkovsky would look like (I was also scared that I wouldn’t like it). Turns out it’s a masterpiece that had me in its grips the whole runtime
