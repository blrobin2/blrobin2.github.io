#### Stray Thoughts/Spoilers

- 22 years of litigation hell over this movie, and 52 total with Kevin McClory. Literally every Bond movie up to this point was negatively affected in some way, but especially from the 70s onward when Kevin McClory sued for sole rights to SPECTRE and Blofeld. It wasn't until McClory's death in 2006 that Eon could make Casino Royale, and 2013 when the McClory estate sold the rights that Eon could make Spectre.
- Max's blanket cropping algorithm cuts off the right and bottom of the movie — at least 40% of the screen compared to the version on Prime
- Fatima Blush
- James Bond's urine is poison
- Throwing a snake in a guy's car — not to bite him, but for spooking him into crashing
- Fatima kissing the snake and the snake sticking out his little tongue
- The transition between them sliding on the floor fucking to them diving in the water is pretty slick
- Chekov's horny fisher — "You did say you'd catch me later"
- Bond in overalls holding up a prize-winning fish
- How did Small-Fawcett find Bond in the lady's hotel room?
- Domino doesn't know what "C'est la vie" means. Clearly never been to Germany
- Domino more amused than horrified that a strange man snuck in and massaged her
- People in formalwear playing arcade games. That's a gala I would attend
- The Domination game is nonsense, but I love that early 80s CGI
- Can't accept a lunch date, sir, I plan on fucking for the foreseeable future
- Rockets that turn into jet packs? Now we're talking
