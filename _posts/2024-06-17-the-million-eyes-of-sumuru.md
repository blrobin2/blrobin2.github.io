**Rating:** 2.5/5

Jonah episode! I need to know Dr. Kabal's deal. I guess I should keep watching episodes? The laughing at jokes has grown fake and grating. Also, the most regressive commentary in ages.

I love a dopey eurospy flick. Strange Klaus Kinski appearance.

* Cigarettes and apple juice: a classic pairing
* Now, if I were a man, where would I ruin things?
* I was told there's some thigh killing here?
* — She sent me to kill you — Do it!
* Keep painting til they look like shoes!
* Make it like the Pink Panther theme, but change every other note
* Okay, who took the time to dry and press all those shorts?
* I love it when a plan kind of happens
