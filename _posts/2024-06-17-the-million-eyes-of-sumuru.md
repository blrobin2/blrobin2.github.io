Jonah episode! I need to know Dr. Kabal's deal. I guess I should keep watching episodes? The laughing at jokes has grown fake and grating. Also, the most regressive commentary in ages.

I love a dopey eurospy flick. Strange Klaus Kinski appearance.

- Cigarettes and apple juice: a classic pairing
- Now, if I were a man, where would I ruin things?
- I was told there's some thigh killing here?
- — She sent me to kill you — Do it!
- Keep painting til they look like shoes!
- Make it like the Pink Panther theme, but change every other note
- Okay, who took the time to dry and press all those shorts?
- I love it when a plan kind of happens
