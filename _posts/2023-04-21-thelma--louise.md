Felt like it was time to watch Ridley Scott’s magnum opus — and Hans Zimmer’s most well-renowned s<i>core after Cool Runnings</i>.

Right off the bat, I needed subtitles to understand Susan Sarandon's accent choice.

Geena Davis is perfect as always, no notes — bringing a gun on a road trip for “psycho killers, bears, or snakes.”

They’re both great, honestly. They give incredible performances of two traumatized people trying to cope with worsening circumstances.

“Every time we get in trouble, you plead insanity or some shit.” What kind of trouble are they getting into before this??

Christopher McDonald was clearly the influence for Kenny Powers, hair and mustache-wise.

Brad Pitt!? Geena Davis panting like a dog over his cute butt, is hysterical. Charming as hell, I don’t blame her.

I love the dude outside the gas station beasting out bicep curls.

The police are remarkably competent in this movie, but I guess they have to be for this plot to work.

The night lighting is so good, it’s exaggerated, but it really works.

Of course, one of the most iconic endings of all time. Ebert wanted to see their charred corpses at the bottom of the Grand Canyon. What a buffoon.

You know, I was kind of facetious earlier about this being Ridley Scott’s best, but the only movie of his I like more is <i>Alien</i>. I’d much rather he make stuff like this instead of the shit he’s been churning out for the past 20 years.

But the music sucks.
