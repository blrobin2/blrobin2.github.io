<i>CW // Violence, Abuse, Suicide, Murder, Blood</i>

Waves crash against the rocks. A house sits on the rocky ridge above. Cecilia (Elisabeth Moss) gets out of bed to dispose of the Diazepam-laced water she gave Adrian (Oliver Jackson-Cohen). She tip-toes through their technically advanced house to grab a tote bag, disable the cameras and the alarm system, and sneak out. She passes through Adrian’s optics lab, where he developed optic and augmentation technology. Her sister Emily (Harriet Dyer) meets her on the main road. Cecilia closes the passenger door, and Adrian punches through the passenger-side window. Emily speeds off.

<b>Two Weeks Later</b>
Cecilia stays with her friend James (Aldis Hodge) and James’ daughter, Sydney (Storm Reid). Cecilia tries to go for a run but sees another man running. Worried it might be Adrian, she rushes back into the house. Emily comes over against Cecilia’s wishes — Adrian could track Emily because he knows where she lives. But Emily tells her that Adrian is dead. The investigation ruled a suicide.

Cecilia doesn’t believe it. She tells Emily about how controlling Adrian was — deciding what she wore or ate or where she went and when. If she didn’t obey him, he could hit her, among other things.

Adrian’s will gives Cecilia $5 million, which she had to show up in person to claim. Back at home, Cecilia notices odd things — inconsistencies. Her conclusion is horrifying and feels impossible, but there's no better explanation. Adrian faked his death and developed a tool to make him invisible.

How will Cecilia prove it and get the help she needs? Or will she have to take matters into her own hands?

Elisabeth Moss gave an outstanding performance that had me connected to her and emotionally invested. Cecilia's situation feels hopeless, and it would take a monster not to root for her, but Moss gives it that extra mile and makes it feel real.

The cinematography creates such anticipation by drawing lines of sight and moving to spaces where no one is. The camera sees what we can't.

The runtime felt indulgent initially, but as it took its turns and developed, it all came together nicely. The ending is a chef's kiss on the lips.

This movie had me on edge the whole time — one of the most tense and terrifying films I've seen.
