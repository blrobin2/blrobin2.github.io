Lando is an ex-convict trying to get his life right. But gang members kill Lando and his son David. God calls Lando's name and he comes back from the dead.

Ben sends a psychic message to come help his Uncle Miguel and his family. The Prince of Magic has fatally wounded Miguel and plans to attack the others.

Lando, along with his wife, Langring, and his daughter, Becky, travel to Miguel's island. There, Lando will learn his fate: to stop The Prince of Magic and the master he serves.

And who is that master? Satan, duh, read the title.

Psychic fighting, snakes taking human form, ocean zombies â€” this movie fucking rules.
