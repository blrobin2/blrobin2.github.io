Some priest throws a sack of Ghoulies in a vat of toxic waste, then accidentally falls in himself. The Ghoulies are fine — they climb out and jump onto a truck heading to the circus. 

The son of the guy who owns the circus is trying to shut down Satan's Den, the haunted house that our hero runs. But the Ghoulies bring in the audiences while also managing to kill a few folks along the way

The plot is boring, but all the kills and mayhem are pretty fun (except for the hero's mentor's death, which is the one tragic beat)

I love these slimy little doofuses — this is a good bad movie
