<blockquote><i>And the Lord said, "I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth, both man, and best, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air. For it repenteth me that I have made them."</i></blockquote>

We get one of my favorite setups: a team of scientists goes missing, so instead of assuming the area is too dangerous, they send more scientists to find the previous expedition. The prior scientists were researching the aftereffects of the Bikini Atoll nuclear tests on the island's fauna.

Like a veritable three-hour tour, the weather gets rough, and their tiny ship is tossed. So, the scientists must stay on the island and continue the research. What they find is certainly not hinted at by the title.

This movie wastes no time getting bonkers. Before they even land on the island, a guy falls into the ocean and surfaces with his head gone. Then we get this gem of a line:

<blockquote><i>I hope that man's death is not an omen of things to come!</i></blockquote>

I was initially surprised by how many folks have watched this. But with a title like "Attack of the Crab Monsters," how can you not?

Was this movie an inspiration for <i>Annihilation</i>??

While the movie isn't outstanding, it's cozy to an MST3K-head such as myself.
