Dr. Craven (Vincent Price) tries to help Dr. Bedlo (Peter Lorre) turn back from a raven into a person, reversing a spell cast by Dr. Scarabus (Boris Karloff)

Jack Nicholson as Dr. Bedlo's son, Rexford, gets a fair helping of the fun, scaling castle walls and rescuing daughters and whatnot

As in all of the Corman Poe movies, the sets and costumes are all top-notch, but without that signature dread, I'm not as invested

Overall, the movie is silly and meandering, but I enjoy seeing these actors goof around with each other
