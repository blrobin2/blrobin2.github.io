A man has a strange dream. He wakes up next to his son. His wife is in the other room, staring off. He senses his wife has a bad dream about their son.

While walking with his son, a vehicle pulls up and stops near him. The vehicle drives over the child, but metal arms and steaming oil come from under the car.

The man seems to change. Water and static shoot from around him. Yadda yadda yadda, he turns into a machine.

The digital artifacts and terrible lighting make the movie look cheap. The audio is poorly mixed, so all the whispered lines are impossible to understand under the abrasive soundtrack. Where a wild visual effect should be, the camera shakes a bunch.

The only thing this has going for the film is the Nine Inch Nails song in the credits. Otherwise, it feels like a total retread of the previous movie, but worse. I don't get who this is for.
