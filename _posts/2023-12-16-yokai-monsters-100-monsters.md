<blockquote><i>There are strange things in this world that are beyond our understanding </i></blockquote>
A landowner wants to tear down a tenement house, as well as its shrine, to build a brothel.

He hosts a parlor game where the group tells 100 supernatural stories about legends or personal encounters.

At the end, he's supposed to perform a cleansing ritual. But the landowner sees it as feeble superstition and refuses. Instead, he gives everyone good luck tokens — piles of cash.

As a result, he leaves the door open for the spirits evoked in the stories to reap revenge.

I like the tone of this one a bit more than in <i>Spook Warfare</i>. It's more serious, but the story is more coherent, and the cinematography is excellent.

I love all of the Yokai designs so much. If a bunch of fellas who looked like that showed up at my place, I would freak the fuck out!

I love how the umbrella yokai is just a boy who wants to chill and get whacky.

The fight choreography is weak, and the story lags in places. But this was so much fun!
