The dance routines are pretty funny, especially the military/July 4th one

Matthew McConaughey doesn’t say “alright” enough, he’s quite good in this

McConaughey says he won’t put his kids in school, that they’ll stay home and learn about the stock market. Later, Mike says, “I’m not my lifestyle… I’m not going to be a 40-year-old stripper”, and we see the endgame for all of them

It takes about an hour before the actual movie emerges, and from there it’s a slow trickle down to the end

It’s not bad, it just long for how little it does
