* I'm turning off the seatbelt light... forever
* I got nothing but Dunkaroos, as you requested 
* No, you're supposed to keep on trucking—what have you done?!
* They're ineffectively guarding heaven now
* — Shoot anyone, ANYONE you don't know. — Aww, that's gonna take a while. The world is full of people I don't know!
* Use the toilet to kill him—that's the rule of Chekov's toilet!
* This guy's like Duolingo for slurs.
* — Don't be too anxious. — She's an efficient therapist!
* Don't do anything stupid. You don't want to go to double jail.
* This one's on the house. That's what Hugh Laurie said at the bar.
