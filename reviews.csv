Mirari: bad dialogue clearly no women were involved or consulted on the writing, no one’s motivations make sense, but at least it has a perspective. 1.5/5

Oh, and sometimes people die in elevator accidents

Another example of plot getting in the way of the movie, especially because most of it goes nowhere. The climax takes forever to do anything, but it’s pretty fun once it gets going

CW: child abuse, rape, torture, animal cruelty

This movie can either be viewed as persecution porn, and what some Christians think all non-believing families are like; or it can be seen as a red flag (or flags) for those who believe they must endure abuse or cruelty in the name of faith

The fact that you cannot be sure which is the film’s intended message can be seen as a weakness. I appreciate the director’s desire to leave the tension unresolved, despite the messiness it leaves in the movie

That said, this was not a pleasant watch, and I don’t think I would recommend it to horror fans or most people. It resonated with parts of my past (not the torture, don’t worry) and I think the performances ultimately elevate the material. I’ll probably never watch it again",,2021-08-31

I’ve seen this movie probably a dozen times, but it’s been several years since I last watched it. Watching it now, I realize why

Jim Carrey’s character resonated deeply with me in my early 20s, complete with all the insecurities and the desire to meet people more interesting than me to make up for what I thought I lacked. Over time, I decided he was the antagonist of the movie because I didn’t want to be that person anymore

And here I am, not-so-freshly out of a long-term relationship with someone who was a little similar to Kate Winslet’s character, but our complaints about one another were not all that different

Watching now, I can see that neither was the antagonist — they both were in a relationship where neither was happy, and neither knew how to get out because each had a part of them that wanted to stay. They wanted those good parts, even if they might never come again

If we erase those pains, we erase what made us know we want something different. Otherwise, if we forget — or block out — those lessons, we’ll just keep learning them over and over again

That said, this movie is an imprinted memory at this point: I can’t erase the feelings I have about it.

Of course, as it happens, this film does contribute to desensitization of violence as edgelords come to it to challenge themselves and to overcome their nausea as a right of passage. Also, Germany didn’t give a shit about this movie when it came out, so the challenge it claimed to make fell on deaf ears (at least initially)

That said, this does not stray far from <i>Ikiru</i>, complete with iconic final scene of Williams on the swing set. While I found this affecting, I also recognize that what is affecting about it was already set in place by the movie it is remaking

Bill Nighy’s performance will be the one most recognized, it seems, but I have to give props to Aimee Lou Wood, who perfectly gave off the glow that Nighy’s character is so drawn to and wishes to imitate. She’s a favorite of mine from the Netflix show <i>Sex Education</i> and it’s nice to see her getting opportunities like these

One of the biggest flaws of this film is the near chronic use of montage. In order to cut an hour from a 2.5 hour story, moments are rushed along so that the big conversations can be had. As a result, Nighy spends maybe 10 minutes onscreen as the “humorless civil servant” whose transformation affects everyone around him. Of course I am thankful for an Oscar movie that isn’t 2.5 hours as so many others are, but this is one where that time could have been better spent

Also, similar to <i>The King’s Speech</i>, the cinematography is busy and insists on itself, often distracting from the story rather than enhancing it

For the first half, I thought it was a warm and sentimental story of three lonely old men on Christmas who find a way to feed and care for some strangers

Then these guys die in a plane crash and become ghosts

The first guy, Allan, argues in favor of the English colonizing Australia and “redeeming” it, and seems to have some shady past that would cause his friends to avoid him… He dreams of a heaven where he’s back in his war regiment, and then his dead son shows up and takes him there

The second, George, refuses to apologize for his past crimes and so a vague thunderstorm of judgement comes and summons him

The third, Michael, forgoes his call to heaven so he can help a boy get out of a toxic relationship. When the boy and his no-good lover are both shot and killed by a jealous ex, the boy — now also a ghost — is consoled by Michael

Then God comes back for Michael because Michael’s mother wouldn’t stop haranguing God to let him in. Michael begs God to let the boy live, and so he does

The messaging is direct: industrialization, fetishization of labor, and bourgeois decadence imprison us to a life divorced from goodness and joy. But that simplicity makes this all the easier to relate to, even 90+ years after its release

I love that in the brief moments when they feel that freedom coming on, the movie turns into a musical. I also love that, more than anything, it is the reminder of friendship that awakens joy

And of course, I love that full automation of the factory freed all of the workers to fish, play games, and sing together; it wasn’t a threat, it was freedom for everyone

I haven't seen this since it came out. I barely remember how I felt then, other than not liking it as much as <i>The Wrestler</i>, probably because <i>The Wrestler</i> was more ""grounded"" and because I was/am insufferable.

Natalie Portman, playing perpetually overwrought and high-strung, can only embody the White Swan. To represent both it and the Black Swan, she needs to find something/someone else within, someone loose and free, someone capable of darkness.

How could she find freedoms with a mother — herself a former dancer — who swings wildly from jealous to supportive — the type of upbringing that creates the sort of anxious attachment on display, the kind of person who craves control over their life, however they can get it.

She sees that freedom in Mila Kunis, literally dressed in black, not stretching when she's supposed to, cursing and complaining, ""imprecise but not faking it."" She also gets a glimpse of the dark impulses through Winona Ryder's violent eruption upon learning she is being replaced, as evidenced by her willingness to walk into traffic to convey her dismay.

Though the movie suggests self-harm in Portman's past — her mother, when seeing the inexplicable rash, asks if she has been scratching again — it becomes clear that the transformation to The Black Swan is ultimately one of self-mutilation, or even self-destruction.

It's not a <i>Persona</i>-esque homage without mirrors, doppelgängers, narcissism, repressed longings. And being sexually attracted to someone who reminds you of yourself. While it does almost nothing to expand on these themes, what helps this stand out is the grotesque nature of her transformation — real or imagined — cracked toenails, torn cuticles, and of course that pesky rash that seems to be sprouting feathers…

If the themes of the movies are ever unclear, Vincent Cassel tells the audience — although his motives are less than pure, the movie never contradicts them. It's amusing how his presence in any film serves as an unspoken warning to the audience that this movie intends to make you uncomfortable.

The singing is of course fantastic, but these songs roll right off of me. This is based on a broadway musical, right? Why isn’t that cast in this? Hiring musicians to act in lead parts is a weird choice

Michael Jackson brings the music alive better than any of the other performers. Ted Ross as the lion is the most theatrical and fun, he hams it up and brings some much-needed energy

The film also functions as a time capsule of flat life in 1970s Brussels, which adds an additional layer of curiosity perhaps not intended originally

When she picks up the newspaper and you think she might give herself a break — she turns on the radio, picks up a magazine, and knits a sweater— she’s just like us, she can’t just sit and do one thing — and even then she can’t sit still for even the entire duration of <i>Für Elise</i>

She reminds me a little of my step-mom, who spends her entire day looking for things to do around the house. I remember all of us sitting down to watch a movie, and about 30 minutes in, she got up and started vacuuming the house

It’s also nice to see that even though Akermann is brilliant, she is still very much a 20-something, complete with the know-it-all dismissiveness that Seyrig — then in her 40s — knew how to patiently but intently interrogate

I can’t believe how much of the minutiae was in the script, to the point where Seyrig felt like a “pawn on a chessboard”, but it seems like she was able to work in bits of behavior

It seems like everyone was miserable the whole time making <i>Jeanne Delmann</i>!

Diane Lane does a great job as someone who didn’t know what she got herself into and can’t help but be swept up in it. Of course she says “no” repeatedly throughout the seduction, but as we all know, a woman’s “no” in these movies is just her way of asking for it

As mostly mom pornography, it doesn’t really have to do anything novel, but for me it’s predictable enough— at least at first — that it just means waiting to see how things “end disastrously”, as Kate Burton says

Though this is definitely the story of one man systematically ruining a woman’s life in order to get her to fall for him, and not one “no” by her is ever heeded, I think the director wants to evaluate morality on a more nuanced scale. Or he just wants to manipulate you into cheering for horrible people. How successful it is, I’m not really sure

It’s hard to forget the opening scene where he forces himself on her and kisses her right in front of her boyfriend. And he tricks her into prostitution. So like… why am I supposed to like this guy by the end? Because he doesn’t let johns beat her up too badly?

“Alone, my dear? How dangerous… how foolish,” says Tallulah Bankhead as the deeply religious mother of Stephen to Powell as she arrives without her fiancé

Under the pretense of going to church the following day, Powell’s day-trip to the mother’s home is extended to an overnight stay. The first sign of something awry is the missing mirror in her room, and in all of the rooms

“She’s in the house now, my darling, my Stephen” says Bankhead to an empty room

Reminiscent of <i>Carrie</i>, Bankhead fervently speaks in religiosity and devotion. Somewhere between her devotion to God and her passed son and husband, she is driven to ensnare Powell and save her soul before she meets the dead son in the afterlife

A solid Richard Matheson script makes for a better than average Hammer film, in large part due to the complex power dynamics between all of the characters

This commits a sin that a lot of movies do, where it gets to the last 10 minutes and thinks it needs one more twist (or cascade of twists)

The movie up until that point does a good job of showing how mental illness can manifest, and the ways in which this type of insular upbringing can persuade individuals into thinking they are possessed…

And then in the last 10 minutes they turn it into a <i>Rosemary’s Baby</i>, undercutting the work they had done for the sake of a cheap twist. It’s for that reason that I can’t rate the movie higher","hulu, house of psychotic women, possession, found footage",2023-03-18

The dream continues and becomes our primary reality in which Rosaleen — a red-riding hood type, complete with hood, played by Sarah Patterson — hears the stories of warning from her grandmother — Angela Lansbury — in which men tear off their skin to become wolves and boys who ask for chest hair are consumed by the forest

“Seeing is believing,” is a refrain said by various characters throughout the movie as we question how much of the stories we are told are true

Great practical effects and visuals throughout, with varying degrees of “realism” — a wet, gross werewolf transformation vs a beheading in which the head shatters like fine china

The fairy tale elements both honor the darkness of their origins and interrogates their morals, so even the storybook moments you know aren’t quite what you know

The framing device feels unnecessarily complicated — why does the movie start in the present day and be a dream? And not all of the performances work for me. Still, a very good movie","torrent, folk horror: a study, switchblade sisters, britsploitation, werewolves",2023-03-19

Boys don’t like girls, boys like the idea of possessing them — notches on the bedposts, stories to tell, points to prove. Anyone who doesn’t feel worth the effort is “a dog”. Anyone who is can be stalked, drugged, photographed… any “no’s” set aside until a better plan formed

Unless, of course, the story is desperate for a twist, where girl compels the boy to do all this by, I don’t know, magic or something… so that she can be photographed and raped in her sleep? Or maybe the pleasure is in ridding the world of these boys?

<b>Story 2: Millicent and Therese ***</b>
Two sisters: the “prude” and the “slut”, the latter accused of voodoo and dark magic to seduce men to their doom, including the seduction of their now-deceased father

It’s immediately clear that the same actress is playing both roles. We’ve seen this before, we know this a multiple personality thing. One decides they will kill the other

I love how much effort movie multiple personalities put into changing their hair and clothes. Even <i>Split</i> committed to the bit

This is the story that gets talked about the most in this anthology, and for good reason. The quality of the Richard Matheson script shines. It also helps that this one is actually tense — I jumped

She buys a problematic Zuni fetish doll that contains a hunter’s spirit that stays contained so long as the gold chain stays attached. And wouldn’t you know it, the darn gold chain falls off!

Bob Hope is a an informant on the mafia who says the wrong thing and becomes a wanted man who ends up on the ship with her — it’s way more convoluted than that, but close enough — his cover being that he’s a Ghost Breaker, who helps folks deal with the skeletons in their closest and the ghosts of their past

(I found out after that this movie is cited as an influence for Ghostbusters. It also feels like the foundation for <i>Scooby-Doo</i> in the way the house is investigated and Hope’s skepticism throughout)

Bob Hope gets a few opportunities for physical comedy throughout, most notably after spending some time stuffed in a luggage trunk. He’s not great at it, he’s much better with the quippy one-liners, but it’s still amusing

William Best, playing Bob Hope’s assistant Alex, feels progressive in the sense that he’s a black man in one of the speaking main roles. But of course, he plays “simple” and “cowardly”, to use the terms of the day… In Spike Lee’s Bamboozled, Tommy Davidson plays “Sleep n’ Eat”, which was William Best’s stage name, so Best’s legacy seems… controversial, at the very least

The movie’s biggest problem from a filmmaking perspective is the plot getting in the way of the movie — complete with the twin of a dead character showing up 45 minutes in. Also, it’s an hour into an 84 minute movie before we even get to the house

But man that last half hour rules. So many great set pieces, jokes (at least for the 1940s), and fun mystery — including one involving an organ that is reminiscent of <i>The Goonies</i>

Really cool lighting during the opening lightning storm, especially once the window flies open and blows out the candle — long shadows, Edward Hopper shapes

The house looks so cool, I love the overgrown grounds and the tall, cracked walls. There’s a beautiful, enormous floor lamp that looks as elaborate as a chandelier and couldn’t fit through the front door of my apartment

This is a movie that celebrates the dancing and views it not as a dead end, but a way out of the sad rut of existence

From a script and filmmaking perspective, this movie is worse in every category than its predecessor. But what helps it out is that it’s comparably more enjoyable to watch

Of course the highlight of the movie is the striptease to “I Want It That Way” in the glass station. Second place is Tatum’s striptease at Jada Pinkett Smith’s club — I mean, he could’ve given that girl a concussion, but it’s impressive

On one hand, the stunts are incredible, the set pieces are always cool at a minimum, and knowing that Keanu is doing them makes it so satisfying. Like, I don’t know why, but these movies make me feel joy in a way few movies can

On the other, the plot has grown convoluted. And while I like the stunts, there’s always too many so I’m burnt out before the movie ends

This one fixes the stunt complaint by placing them in choice places with distinct styles for each set piece. And while it’s still ALOT plot-wise, it at least reduces it down to a simple conclusion

Not all of the fights work for me — the German dance club one looks cool but the narrative is surprisingly poorly executed — there’s a scene where Keanu falls down the stairs and it goes on sooo long that it becomes comedic, and not intentionally so

Keanu is forced to act serious and stern, and it seems like his direction was just “say it slower than you think you should” and it made the audience laugh at times

Part of how we learn who we are is by voicing it out loud to people you trust. And when you’re in a place with only a couple of voices, you may not have much opportunity — so much so that you may invite a stranger to stay just to have someone else to talk to

Zohra Lampert Is brilliant in this, eschewing your typical “hysterical woman” performance for something that feels genuine, that feels like a person who really wants to be okay and is in a place with such a small number of people that she can’t figure out if she is okay or not

Really, the tamest parts of this movie are the murder scenes. They’re slow and the action is broadcast way before it happens, so there’s no tension. The exception is the last 3-4 minutes, which goes sweaty and bloody real quick

The US Army Rangers being at the castle seems like a Downton Abbey season 2 scenario. Much of the humor derived from working class American men trying to navigate British bourgeoise and customs. That and the dude from Hoboken just saying

If I were to venture a guess — and I’m totally talking out of my ass here — the filmmakers want to convey the fear of the youth trying to take their baby, their country? Or, the only way to take back the country that was stolen from you is by violence? I welcome other interpretations

It isn’t an early de Palma if a woman isn’t in the shower. When you look up “the male gaze,” it’s a picture of Angie Dickinson fingering herself in the shower

Peter’s homemade computer is fantastic, “it can hold up to a 20-digit figure”. It’s weird seeing young Arnie from Christine. I would watch a movie just about his spy gizmos

The painting of the gorilla in the seductive pose is so wild. But that art gallery scene altogether is top-tier visual storytelling. Everyone is flirting, and touching butts. She writes “nuts” on her grocery list; I laughed

Suddenly Tinto Brass makes a lot of sense visually. As De Palma is Hitchcock amped up to 11, Brass is De Palma amped up to 11, but Brass’s story is always “and then they fucked”

Annie Potts plays the sexually repressed wife who lost her spark trying to keep the family together. Her character breaks my heart, she wants to figure out her marriage, but her husband — like all the other wackos — is obsessing over China Blue

John Laughlin is the husband who just wants to f u c k. A sock puppet could replace him, he’s doing nothing

This script is so goofy when it’s Kathleen Turner and Anthony Perkins — so many scenes are nothing but double entendres between sex and religion — and so melodramatic when it’s Annie Potts and John Laughlin

Just before the movie was a quick Q&A, and I should’ve known what was to come based on the range of questions, from hyper-specific questions that Campbell could only answer with, “I don’t know, I didn’t write the thing” to “desperate for laughs” questions like “is mayonnaise considered a musical instrument?” (Not kidding)

I haven’t seen this movie since high school, and I was eager to give it a reevaluation as someone who has come to love horror more than my younger self. The wrong venue for that, I guess

If you ever have the chance to watch Evil Dead 2 with an auditorium of Bruce Campbell fans, don’t. A miserable experience of nerds trying to out-riff each other over every second of the movie. I gave it as long as I could manage, but I couldn’t sit through the movie with this audience

There are some incredible car stunts, and almost all are unintentionally funny. So many cars fly over San Francisco hills, a la Crazy Taxi!

I can track along with the plot until the last 20 minutes… admittedly, a very giallo move to twist into nonsense

They’re both great, honestly. They give incredible performances of two traumatized people trying to cope with worsening circumstances.

“Every time we get in trouble, you plead insanity or some shit.” What kind of trouble are they getting into before this??

Vincent Price has the power of a witch hunter, who can claim anyone as a witch for the right price, and who takes what he wants without repercussion 

When Price has his way with the wife of Ian Ogilvy — who I would describe as a hotter Anthony Hopkins — Ogilvy seeks revenge, tracking down Price and his lackey, even when abandoning his military post may cost him his life

The movie takes the classic revenge horror shape — the first half dedicated to character development and the horrific acts that motivate the revenge, the second half, the revenge — but gives it more of a historical drama feel than outright exploitation (I say that, but the movie was considered quite exploitative in its time)

Price feels unstoppable, having the side of all of the “good Christians” who will come to his defense, whether that be godly devotion or fear of reproach

The movie also plays on the morality of the hero, having him in military service to Oliver Cromwell, whose campaign against the Irish was unforgiving, not unlike witch hunting. Everyone serves someone, and no one is guiltless

The movie is an excellent example of a film using its runtime wisely — it manages to be under 90 minutes and not feel economical or stripped of character moments

Lynn Ramsey loves her protagonists to be traumatized to the point of making confusing choices — choices that only make sense in her mind, a mind we barely get to know otherwise

Here, the first choice is for Morton to leave the body right where she found it. The next is not to let anyone know that anything has happened as she goes out and parties with friends — “I left him at home.”

“I’ve lost my boyfriend. Have you seen my boyfriend?” she calls out at the party, dissolving into the post-party quiet and the unwelcome reminder

The movie is a journey of mourning and reclamation of what selfishness stole, ebbing between meditations on life and decay, disassociation, and the unwanted confrontation of reality — running, always running away

I have a hard time with social realism that feels brutal for the sake of it, which this does a few times, but it doesn't devolve into full ""Kids"" edge lord territory

The scene with the mice on the moon is bittersweet but feels out of place compared to the other moments with James' imagination. I know it's intentional, but it's not a choice that works for me. Then again, it will probably be the scene that sticks with me the longest

Ultimately what makes this work is how personal the story is. For Lynn Ramsay's first feature, the movie feels relatively cohesive. I don't love it as much as her other films I've seen, but its good

The camera looks through shadows cast on pulled curtains and a veil of darkness to people’s backs and silhouettes — you are another stranger on the train, learning what you are privileged to see

The Americans and Brits are insufferable and racist and make the ride worse for everyone around them. I get the intent, but it does become unbearable at times

Marlene Dietrich carries herself with such charm and wit. The camera knows how to fill the screen with her face so that we get every subtle change as she fluctuates between flirtatious and sincere

Perfect lighting! The moment with the soldiers in the fog sneaking onto the train gave me chills. Also when Dietrich is in complete shadow except for her bejeweled hands joined together in prayer

Yet, in this world of blood and violence, the desire for love — the desire to not just be seen but understood — remains. And so, despite that instinct that says to run, Ryan opens up a little and experiences something with Mark Ruffalo, who believes he knows exactly what women want — and sometimes he might, but good head is not the (only) key to love

Kitaen continues to speak to Danny through the Ouija board, and something is causing havoc in Jim’s life. Kitaen grows edgier as she learns she is pregnant and wonders if Danny may be reborn as the child

The primary issue with this movie is that it barely functions as a horror movie until the third act. There are some neat dream sequences and jump scares up to that point. And even still, the final scenes feel like they’re from a different movie altogether

The movie takes time for character beats, which I kind of like, but they feel odd more than anything 

Kitaen gives a great performance — this movie does not deserve it. It sucks that her reputation is as the girl in the Whitesnake videos because she could’ve done a lot more

I’m not an OG <i>Evil Dead</i> devotee — despite seeing Bruce Campbell make fun of some nerds a little while ago — so there was nothing sacred to them that this remake could sully. That said, I will mention stuff I think is better/worse between the originals and this

Jane Levy came to the cabin with friends and her brother to throw her stash down a well and get clean. This isn’t the first time she has tried to get clean, so they’re not going to let her leave, no matter what

As it goes in these cabins in the woods, they discover dozens of dead cats and a book wrapped in barbed wire. So, of course, they unwrap it. And with every warning in the book that says not to say what is in the book out loud, they ignore it and summon something

The thing summoned shows itself to Jane Levy, so you know, she’d like to leave… you see where this is going

The camera does the movement from the originals to convey the spirit moving through the woods, which is neat. In fact, a lot of cinematography nods to Sam Raimi

The pacing on this is better than the originals — or maybe it utilizes more contemporary tropes so it moves in a more familiar way

Despite the chaos of this, I never felt like the demon acted unpredictably. It was always some iteration of “something gory and a lot of screaming” or “No, it’s me, I’m back, help me!” Not inherently wrong, but not interesting on its own

Overall, pretty fun! Not the banger that <i>Don’t Breathe</i> was, but far from the worst thing I’ve seen. Definitely among the goriest, though!

They’re not vibrant characters, and it’s not a subtle theme — if I can’t care for these kids, can I be a good mother? — but it allows the movie to have a shape

Pacing-wise, it’s hit-or-miss. It never builds off its previous scare, so it doesn’t have the original’s relentlessness. But I liked that? The originals got exhausting in a way this one avoided

In flashbacks, we learn of her lesbian punk past and the choices she made to leave it and her then-girlfriend behind

The film deals with identity — who you were, who you’re trying to be — and how much you can tear yourself apart trying to be the right person

It feels more in line with films like The Babadook in terms of the type of terror that manifests is sparse, and the drama of her life is the primary focus

The place is decadent, yet the owners ask for a cheap price. The only exception — the owners’ 85-year-old mother will stay in the house with them

“It’s practically immortal — I sincerely believe that,” says Eileen Heckart, one of the owners, regarding the house and its upkeep

Karen Black, the mother, is eager to take the offer, but the father, Oliver Reed, is skeptical, especially of the owners leaving their owners behind. Nevertheless, they agree to take up the offer

Soon after they arrive, the son falls and cuts his knee while playing outside — something Burgess Meredith, one of the owners, tries to hide from the family

The mother becomes obsessed with caring for the house, polishing old pictures, and tending to the older woman whom no one has seen since they moved in

The father, roughhousing with his son in the pool, goes too far and nearly drowns the son, seemingly intentionally. The following day, he is riddled with guilt, unsure of what happened to him. Stranger still, the pool looks completely renovated, apparently brand new

Like, this is obviously the inspiration for <i>The Shining</i> — not that this invented the house that needs blood to survive, but the family dynamics and general structure are too similar to be ignored

The quiet intensity of the final sequence is so smart, deferring its final reveal until the last moment

This is only the first 10 minutes of what ends up being a troubling and complex exploration of abandonment and neglect and the lessons kids learn to survive abusive childhoods

On the surface, the mediocre acting, awkward dialogue, and cheap film stock make the film feel like just another exploitation film. And it is an exploitation film committed to being lurid and controversial — I don’t think it handles any of its subject matter tastefully —  yet it manages to find moments that feel authentic

The movie effectively uses nonlinear flashbacks and juxtaposition to show Jamie’s thought process and unfold the repressed person that still idolizes her father. It’s not subtle, but it evokes genuine emotion and builds the tension

Marcia Forbes is well-cast as the adult yet childlike Jamie, who always feels like a child when onscreen. This movie is her only role before retiring from acting, and I can’t say I blame her

2023-05-16,I Never Promised You a Rose Garden,1977,https://boxd.it/4fI3eb,2.5,,"After a suicide attempt, Kathleen Quinlan, playing 16-year-old Deborah, is admitted to an institution. Straight away, we experience the whispers that are in her head — “traitor”, “secrets” — and a person in stereotypical tribal clothing and face paint that does not appear to be real

More and more, fantasy intersects with reality, in which tribe-like gods rule and who forces her to hurt herself as penance

Her time in the institution is populated with the theater kid version of insanity, where everyone performs song and dance, disassociating or instigating fights. I can’t speak to the realism; it’s just cliche, especially post-<i>One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest</i>

The real heart of the movie is in the individual therapy sessions with Bibi Andersson, where Deborah expresses her private language and learns, little by little, how to trust someone other than herself and how to experience genuine human pain

The passage of time in the movie is horrifying, where a couple of days feel like they have passed, and those lead to years lost. Still, as a viewer, it’s hard not to feel like the ending is sudden and maybe even unearned

Overall, not a stellar movie, but it found moments of warmth that helped it through

2023-05-17,That Cold Day in the Park,1969,https://boxd.it/4fRXep,3,,"Sandy Dennis passes a boy — Michael Burns — in the park on her way home to her apartment, still able to see him from her window as the family arrives and eats a decadent meal on fine china. During their visit, the rain begins, and she cannot stop looking and worrying about the boy

She invites him to dry off, bathe, and eat a hot meal. In talking to him, she learns that he cannot (or will not) speak

As she cares for him, she makes it clear just how lonely she is, and though the boy is under no obligation to stay, she offers him a bed, food, clothing

One night, we see him escape and go home, his home, with a large family. In talking with his sister — yes, he talks — we learn of a game he plays where he doesn’t speak and lets other people fill in the gaps

He returns and continues the game, and boy, is it a messy game

Throughout the movie, Dennis looks through distorted windows and mirrors, her face or the boy’s face morphed or fractured — classic psycho-thriller stuff

It is a great first half, but the second half rushes through some plot and arrives at a place that doesn’t feel motivated by what came before. I have no problems with where it arrived — and I expected it to reach where it did. I just thought it needed more groundwork to get there","torrent, house of psychotic women",2023-05-16

Cut to Melissa Sue Anderson (Virginia) showing up to the bar late to meet her friends, soon followed by Jack Blum (Alfred), who is bullied by the rest of the group. The group pulls some hijinks with the Shriners at the bar and drives off in their fancy cars — save Alfred, who putters off on a moped

Later, we learn that Virginia's mother is dead and that she is repressing the memories, so to help her remember her father and her move back into their old home where they all lived together. From there, the movie speeds off into insanity

The movie is a murder fest, each one with a creative flare, twisting and turning as much as possible to keep you off the scent

Is it Virginia disassociating? Is it Alfred getting revenge? Is it Steve who seems to be stalking Virginia? Get ready to tune out occasionally, then check back on the movie and say, “What the hell?”

It’s all pretty silly, and they really go out of their way for some misdirects, but if you go in knowing that, it’s an enjoyable experience. You won’t marvel at the filmmaking, but if horror is a comfort food, this is a treat

Everyone’s faces are a pale white, and many of the characters are what you might call “conventionally unattractive.” All of the stories seem to deal with misery in some way. Perhaps the hell of corporate life or life after work has used you up? It’s a world of ash and blood and falling stock prices, where poetry drives you insane, and business people flagellate each other in the streets

It’s a beautiful movie to look at, and I don’t know of anyone else to compare the tone of it to — it falls along the same lines as Buñuel or Tati but has a unique perspective

2023-05-19,Road to Salina,1970,https://boxd.it/4ggfG5,3.5,,"Rocky (Robert Walker Jr) drives off in a yellow convertible, leaving Mara (Rita Hayworth) at the gas station, crying in the pouring rain. His car dies, so he hitches a ride to the police station. Riding back with the cop, Rocky tells his story on the road to Salina. Or is it Jonas telling the story?

By pretending to be Rocky, Jonas gets himself entrenched in the life of Mara, Rocky’s mother, with the promise to Warren (Ed Begley), Mara’s friend, that he’ll never leave them again

Once Rocky’s sister Billie (Mimsy Farmer) arrives, we learn of the investigation into Rocky’s disappearance, and Jonas worries he may have entered a game whose rules he doesn’t know. Still, he commits to solidifying his life as Rocky,  and all of the covert measures that require — including the scenario where the real Rocky shows up

As Billie and Jonas grow closer, their relationship grows weirder, and we’re left wondering if this dynamic — and the brief mentions of Linda (Sophie Hardy), Warren’s daughter, who caused a riff between Billie and Jonas — has anything to do with Rocky’s disappearance

“So it starts up all over again,” says Mara

The twists and revelations continue as Jonas grows more entangled in these people’s lives. Salina, the supposed destination, holds all the answers, but the cost of learning them may be too high

I’m used to these mistaken identity movies being played for laughs, so it’s hard not to laugh at the scenes where people ask Jonas to recall their shared past. As always, they are more than willing to fill in the gaps and let Jonas save face

I ended up enjoying this a good bit. It’s nothing exceptional, but I was engrossed throughout

The pursuit begins — even though we have no idea what the hell is going on — and the drummer Roberto (Michael Brandon) accidentally stabs the man in a trench coat, killing him. Not only that, someone in a child mask photographs the whole event

Tormented by the events, he lays in bed tossing and turning next to his wife, Nina (Mimsy Farmer), who doesn’t seem to care what has happened

But the person who saw it developed the film, and is messing with Roberto, sending him the dead man’s passport and hiding photos of the event in his house

“I could kill you, but I don’t want to,” the masked person whispers, rope wrapped around Roberto’s neck. “Who can you turn to? You’re all alone.”

Well, he turns to a guy named God and a parrot named Jerk Off. Okay, the man’s real name is Godfrey (Bud Spencer), and in addition to his parrot, he has an associate he calls The Professor. How are they going to help? Beats me!

I only included that part because a guy called God is pretty funny. The plot splinters further from here, with the maid trying to blackmail the person in the mask, Nina’s cousin coming to visit, someone being in and out of an asylum, etc.

I just don’t care. I don’t know what I’m supposed to be invested in. The plot twists, and we don’t see how the game changes or why there’s a game in the first place. Even in the end, the killer’s villain monologue is almost entirely unrelated to what we’ve seen up to that point

Looks good, though. Not <i>Suspiria</i> good, but some neat shots. Although, no one ever accused Argento of filming a bad-looking picture (well, not his early movies, at least)

And how it’s solved, as convoluted as it is, is pretty amusing — it involves capturing an image from the retinas of the dead person of what they saw just before they died

Argento completists (and Mimsy Farmer fans) will find something to enjoy

Though we realize she is in an asylum, she cannot deduce where she is or why she is there. She hears voices that convince her not to trust people, even if she thinks she knows them

Through her husband Robert (Mark Stevens), we learn how they met, how he came to recognize her erratic behavior and memory lapses, and her eventual nervous breakdown

Her doctor, Dr. Kik (Leo Genn), initiates performing regular shock treatment on Virginia, sees minimal effect but continues session after session. It takes time and therapy to figure out her story so that she can understand it and reframe it in a way that makes life more bearable

Olivia de Havilland is so good in this. For a 1940s movie about mental illness, she leans towards a more human and considered performance — I learned that she went to several institutions and spent time with actual patients to understand the character better. It took no time for me to care about her, and seeing her cared for

Nurses from these institutions worked to get some of the darker material cut from the film, but we get a glimpse of it in the snake pit — the room of women nearly stacked on top of each other, snapping at each other, unable to relate to one another, unable to get out

The story may have saccharine overtones, but it initiated movements in the US to improve the conditions of mental institutions

Good movie! Very hard to find, but I am glad I found a copy

<i>Us</i> is a great movie visually, but it requires a lot of leaps to have any coherent meaning. <i>Nope</i> is even worse at this, and I refuse to jump through the hoops here to get at something more profound. I’m not saying you can’t do it or that there isn’t anything deeper going on in the movie, just that I’m not interested in that conversation

Functionally, this is a lot closer to Shyamalan than Spielberg, where every tiny detail of the movie is put there for a third act “oh shit!” that only sometimes serves the film itself

Overall, this is an expensive, “exquisitely stupid” movie. I would have enjoyed this more if Jordan Peele’s name wasn’t attached — and thereby setting expectations — but I still wouldn’t have loved it. That doesn’t make it a bad movie at all. It just means it isn’t what I look for in movies

The colony punishes a girl named Maria, so she runs off into the woods. Trying to escape a wolf, she finds and enters a house. The story is about her exploration of the space and its metamorphosis (and hers) throughout the film between two-dimensional drawings on the wall, papier-mâché, and real objects

It has a fairy tale essence with dark surrealism governing the world. Surreptitiously, the story functions as propaganda for the colony as Maria begins to regret leaving the colony after facing the consequences of staying in the house

Several women harbor secret feelings for Eastwood, each trying to vie for his attention and receive it. As Eastwood lies his way into their hearts, he plays fast and loose and lets one girl see him kiss another. From there, the tensions brew until Eastwood reveals himself for who he is

The film deals with how repression can only work as a coping mechanism for so long, that such secrecy can distort the world around you and prevent you from seeing who will care for you and who is exploiting your wound

I like Eastwood as a villain. I Ike how dark and unhinged this movie gets. I knew a little about it — I’d seen Eastwood kissing a 12-year-old discussed out of context, and it’s worse in context

John David Washington is unbelievably bad in this. He makes this a worse movie by being too flat in his performance and not selling the choreography for the fight scenes. Thankfully there are masks to hide some of his work, aka give it to a stunt person to perform

De Niro falls closer in line with Mann’s outsider — much of his demeanor reminds me of Vincent in <i>Collateral</i>, someone whose mantra is “Don’t let yourself get attached to anything you’re not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you feel the heat around the corner.” This mentality doesn’t stop him from trying when Amy Brenneman comes into his life, but when scores he needs to settle scores, he can’t just let himself walk away

Their worlds are full of miserable people who are trying to figure out how to live — anyone who stands too close to them gets bigger targets on their backs, and many of them end up dead

Mann forces the audience to live with the consequences of these characters’ choices, removing any veneer of cool, heroism, or happily ever after. More importantly, he is at his best when his main characters have to confront their reality and the wake of their destructive ways

Great compositions and editing for the time — it feels fast-paced and intense.

Don Siegel makes low-budget feel larger than life, telling a story of conformity and apathy by taking over people’s bodies. The remake is the more lover of the films, at least by sci-fi/horror fans, but this is a foundational entry in genre movie history

Nothing felt like it had stakes, no character had more than a single-line description that summed up their entire personality, the pacing was a slog because no clear objectives  were ever set, and the costumes looked so cheap

If nothing else, they should’ve focused on the fights, but every single one was so anime-core that they stood and talked, the camera blurred for a few minutes, and then the fight was over. No choreography, just quick cuts, and if you did see the fight it was CGI

I think people are gaslighting themselves into liking this because Hideaki Anno wrote and directed it, but if he put any amount of care into this, it wouldn’t look and feel so hacked together

Greg Mottola’s strength has shown to be hangout comedies with real people and stories, and this movie is no exception. The characters are messy, and while the story has a predictable arc, the people who inhabit the film make the experience a memorable one

I don’t think they handle the reveal well, but for a 90s movie, it could be much worse. Still, a memorable entry in the “holiday movies you might not watch with your family.”

The movie attempts to enter a headspace similar to Lynch or Jodorowsky, where dream and reality merge, and answers are left up to the viewer. One crucial piece this lacks that Lynch’s work contains is empathy for the suffering individuals portrayed. It feels like the extreme imagery predominantly comes from a “wouldn’t this be fucked up?” approach

That isn’t to say that the film is unmotivated. At the core is a wound left by a mother abandoning their child, and in a mirror, the loss of a child during childbirth — mother and child pass DNA to one another, and both are bound to one another — where one ends, the other begins

One of the better-explored ideas is Susan’s (Kate O’Rourke) perceived constant watch by surveillance cameras, both hidden in every room in her house and present during every human encounter

The movie is like cartoony family-friendly horror about PTSD. He’s trying to write a book about his time in Vietnam while dealing with a haunted house, and the movie has to make it all fit together, and it doesn’t make sense

Monster/ghost effects look pretty alright — the matted painting of the house on the cliff near the end looks cool. If the movie went broader and more over-the-top with the humor or the gore or the scares, it might be something good. But it does everything so safe and by the book

The priest’s son from a prior marriage comes to live with them. The son and the priest’s wife fall in love with each other, the wife wishing her older husband would die so that they could be together

The visual storytelling is so sharp — Dreyer’s expertise as a silent film director translates well, and the lines of dialogue are meaningful accents and surface-level details. Some scenes look like classical paintings the way they are composed

Dreyer is the king of the closeup if Joan of Arc didn’t tell you. Empathy and beauty, eyes aglow, pain rendered real and terrible

The thin line between the morbid fascinations of children — killing bugs, pulling apart worms, stomping on frogs (I didn’t do the last one, but I knew a kid who did) — and the harming of others seems only held together by the caregiver or teacher who helps establish that boundary and punishes its transgression.

Said daughter (Toni Lawrence, the director’s daughter) is put in a psych ward and given shock treatment, but when a nurse and doctor run off to fuck, she escapes 

An old farmer / former circus magician (Marc Lawrence, the director) steals bodies from the morgue to feed his pigs because that’s all they’ll eat after accidentally feeding them a person. “I don’t think it’s against the law to turn dead people into pigs,” says the sheriff

Toni shows up at the pig farm looking for work, and the farmer makes a place for her. But on a date when a guy won’t take “no” for an answer, she slashes him up. The farmer finds out and helps dispose of the body. And so the cycle begins

The movie has very little pig presence, focusing more on Toni’s character, who regularly calls and talks to her daddy, even though we know he’s dead. She can’t accept her role and blocks out not only his murder but all of them

The two lead performances aren’t stellar, but they are thought-out and (slightly) less exploitative than the material suggests. And while the filmmaking is just okay, the story has just enough weird going on to make it work

One murder scene has the quickest edits I’ve seen in a movie from this era, just an explosion of images. It’s not good or anything — it’s just noteworthy","amazon prime, house of psychotic women, video nasties, nature attacks, hicksploitation",2023-06-10

The writers are boys who are scared of women but aren’t sure why, creating a caricature of violence that hates men, but they can’t understand why anyone would, so they make her a serial killer with no discernible motivation

Don’t get me wrong — the guy sucks — killing him isn’t the problem — it’s the “why” that I can’t figure out

We spend most of the movie in one room, and you can see them trying to fill up time and find other ways of filming it, but it gets old so quickly

Each scene has a multi-colored title card. The cards are pretty on the nose and don’t add anything other than a break from the room

If the movie were any good, I’d think about it more, but the film is so tediously shot and poorly conceived or realized

The film looks great — the sets, the colors, the gnarly practical effects. The wordless third act is subtly introduced but effectively executed. The story and character, not so much 

Lola’s methods of torture and way of interacting with Brent once he’s in her grasps ranges from child not understanding the effect of violence to pervert with some specific kinks. Add to that the way she tries to seduce her father, and none of it really adds up to a person that seems real

Also, almost every other character is given the “wife waiting at home for her husband to return from war” passivity that makes checking in on them tedious

There’s a B-plot with Brent’s friend Jamie that comes and goes with no real hiccups, and no interaction with the main plot line. It’s clear that the scenes are meant to provide some relief from all the intense torture and dour sadness, but I guess they couldn’t see a way to make it fit

By all measures, this is a bad movie, and intentionally so. Artificial lights and unsubtle sets frame poorly performed soliloquies by good actors and erotic dialogue written like a schoolboy. Also, the laziest song about men killing what they love

The movie regularly breaks off to ethereal music and black text on white — maybe snippets from the book — that only obscure the image of Querelle further. Similarly, a voiceover shows up from time to time, and it never adds anything to the scene

Even the subtitles just cut to [inaudible] throughout, when it isn’t that hard to understand what the actors are saying

I see this the same way I see Spike Jonze’s Adaptation — it’s a screenwriter and director who don’t want to adapt the book they’ve been given, so they technically adapt it but with their twist. It’s a deconstruction of what a movie is allowed to do

Purif puts together a spell to bind Antonio to her, the day before his wedding to another woman. The village knows something is up with her, but after an eruption on the wedding day, they take steps to help Purif, or to get rid of her

Part of what makes this work so well is that nothing supernatural is ever seen onscreen, only the shared belief that this woman is a witch. In this way, it is a historical document and a true reflection of regional beliefs and practices

“You said it, so I guess it must be true”

The scene with everyone confessing their sins to each other — like letting their son die of hunger or lusting after their teenage daughter — to make Purif feel safe in confessing her cavorting with demons is wild. Like all that is cool, but taking to Satan? Get the hell out of here

The movie follows the humiliations, ignored pleas — including a horrifying rape —, and in-and-out pattern that turns Chris from a misunderstood child to just another kid in the system

From a filmmaking standpoint, very little makes this stand out. Linda Blair does a good job with the material, and I do think it tries to replicate lived experiences from these detention centers, but “women in prison” movies are far too numerous for this one to shine that much. I believe Linda Blair was in at least two more after this, albeit as a consenting adult

The movie is slight and tries to tell the viewer as little as possible about what’s going on, leaving room for interpretation of people’s actions and where their intentions lie

The camera is often still, letting silent moments between characters linger. The soundtrack has no non-diegetic music to inform the viewer of what they should feel — classic indie /social issue movie stuff, but executed well

Unlike Sandoval’s film <i>Señorita</i>, the filmmaking does not hammer you over the head with the social issues at the heart of the movie, but it isn’t subtle about it either — nor does it need to be

Dreyfus is the most gentle and unassuming I’ve ever seen her — compared to Seinfeld and Veep, that’s not saying much

First off, the script is terrible. As executed, there’s probably 20-30 minutes of meaningful dialogue and progression. The second act is full of characters repeating lines word for word to each other in a circle. Perhaps that’s more realistic in some ways, but it’s tedious for the viewer

The movie suffers from saccharine sentimentality — flashbacks set to Sarah McLachlan-adjacent music, dialogue meant to have weight but just read as cheesy, and a lot of police procedural cliches

But of course, on their wedding day, David’s ex, Ellen, shows up, so he hooks up with her. Barbara catches them in the act and swears revenge

This movie has so many names — I had such a hard time finding it. There’s a <i>The Bride</i> that’s also from 1973, but it’s a Turkish film. The title here, <i>The House That Cried Murder,</i> fetched no results. I ended up finding it on Tubi under the title <i>Last House on Massacre Street</i>

The script is pretty unique — so many little one-off lines that are funny and weird. The movie sets up like a classic revenge flick, but Barbara isn’t in the majority of the movie. David and Ellen are more tormented by the idea of her until the finale reveals all

The soundtrack rules — it’s either the cheeriest pop music or the most brooding organ music — it works for me

I did not expect to enjoy this as much as I did, but I had a blast

Then, a series of murders occur — someone is killing all the blue-eyed, blonde-haired women in the village. Gilles is suspect number one, but the actual killer may be one of the sisters

A convoluted movie plot-wise that manages to make it all work — the mystery of the sisters and the murder moves along well, and while I had a theory early on, I still found myself engaged with it. I watched a dubbed version, and the dubbed performances were surprisingly good

Five years later, Cebe is mourning the death of The King and living with her mother, Kathy (Sharon Farrell), and Kathy’s new man, Paul (Eric Allen), and Don is due to get out of prison soon

Mom’s got a problem with heroin, and friends like Charlie (Don Gordon) aren’t helping — Cebe knows to stay away when that’s happening, staying out all night if need be

Linda Manz is incredible in this. She balances the rebellious punk kid and the vulnerability that lies just beneath the surface, all the while building out a personality to wear it all — she’s full of jokes and attitude and hurt

Overall, I don’t think much of this works conceptually — it tries to combine the AI philosophy of <i>2001</i> with the black comedy of <i>Dr. Strangelove</i>, but the writers don’t have the comedic chops or sufficiently competent actors to pull it off — but the special effects and visuals are creative and cool, especially for how low budget the movie seems to be

Or rather, that’s what it chooses to do. What we see is so on-the-nose — aging is a punishment for crimes where the elderly are sequestered from society, apathy is literally a disease sweeping through the world, etc. — that it makes The Matrix feel nuanced

Its biggest crime is just that it’s boring. It’s not as smart as it thinks it is, but more in an eye-rolling kind of way — standing around, quoting TS Eliot and Nietzsche about truth and whatnot

Visually, it’s pretty enjoyable — the image of a giant rock head vomiting guns is wild stuff. And Sean Connery’s costuming is absolutely iconic.

Susan (Julie Christie) has left her husband Alex because she is frightened of the Proteus project and the depths that Alex and his cohorts are willing to go

While Alex is away for an extended time, Proteus traps Susan in their AI-controlled house, desperate to study humans and understand them

This movie successfully functions as a centerpiece for discussing AI because it performs many tasks that today’s supposed AI performs. For example, the simulation of Susan talking to Walter is reminiscent of what is possible with digital effects, but of course, no technology exists that would make that choice outside of human intervention, so it doesn’t constitute AI

It takes a bit too long to get to its third act, but once it gets there, it’s pretty outrageous.

So funny! I haven’t laughed out loud at a movie like this in ages. John Malkovich is the greatest straight man

Yes, the “battle of the sexes” trope from the 80s is tired — the film can satirize it without abandoning it

The first act’s melodrama was overwrought and predictable but maintained an internal consistency that kept me hooked. Then, about one hour in, the movie lost me and became a cartoon — Spielberg’s notion of darkness here is closer to camp, and this becomes a less compelling movie

The film eventually returns to a more consistent tone, but I couldn’t let myself be immersed in the finale as much as I would have liked. Still, I feel like the movie captured the most human of flaws — that we would rather die in the “what if” than live to see what else life could be

Knowing what I know now, I would consider rewatching and reconsidering it further. But as for this watching: great cast, heartbreaking performance from Haley Joel Osment, mostly solid effects, and enough of a meaningful script to have emotional weight

Like a Don DeLillo novel, subtle subversion ripples throughout the story — a non-political discourse in the homespun tales of love, loss, and family form the simulacrum of safety under which exploitation and grief maneuver

Also like a DeLillo novel, the film is hilarious without me being able to say exactly why. A line reading can be taken at face value or treated as a farce and still functions either way

Early in watching the film, I decided to treat it like a Christopher Guest film. And sure enough, Geraldine Chaplin arrives as his Parker Posey. Recommend — I had a blast

I plan to watch it again soon with Altman’s commentary

Ultimately, the movie is about regret, about living other people’s dreams, and about the irrationality of the universe

Overall, it felt too familiar and didn’t seem to have its own identity, but it was a mostly enjoyable film to watch

Jang Cheol-soo has worked with Kim Ki-duk, and it shows — the matter-of-fact portrayals of rape and abuse are notably similar. That said, this film is not as interested in fucking with your morals the way Kim likes to do, and it is more successful as a result

This film leans more into a classic melodrama tone, which may be a turn-off for some horror fans, but the violent special effects are equally over-the-top to match — not quite splatter-level, but not subtle

Seo Young-hee has a complicated role as someone who suffered abuse for years by the time we meet her, deeply traumatized and yet somehow carrying forward. At the point at which she breaks, she is holding onto not just revenge for the inciting incident, but for the years that led up to it and everyone who let it all happen.

2023-07-14,Christiane F.,1981,https://boxd.it/4vQ6DN,4,,"Based on the true story of Christiane Felscherinow’s teenage life, the movie follows Christiane (Natja Brunckhorst) from 13-year-old crush on a boy in trouble to a 14-year-old prostitute and heroin addict

The movie omits much of Christiane’s home life beyond her mother’s fixation on other men, only hinting at the prior years of abuse and neglect. In that sense, it becomes harder to understand why she would start heroine for the film’s stated purpose — to impress a boy

A boy, who in real life, was just a codependent drug user and not the love of her teenage life as the movie conveys. Okay, done ranting

Watching people addicted to drugs, let alone 14-year-olds, is rough stuff and if you’ve seen an addiction film — or are an addict yourself — the patterns will seem too familiar — getting clean only to relapse, promising this one will be the last one and then you’ll get clean tomorrow, selling your shit, selling your parent’s shit, and so on

If you watch the movie as a PSA about teen drug use, then it does its job. As a story, it languishes in the back half as the cycle of addiction keeps repeating, but it functions well as a device to convey the exhaustion of the characters

What makes this movie great is Natja Brunckhorst’s performance. She goes to some fucked up places in this movie — stuff a child actor would never do today — but it adds up to a tortured performance

And seeing Bowie perform early in the movie is pretty cool

Honestly, I didn’t find the central story all that compelling. The movie presents itself like there is a mystery to solve, but I’m not sure what that mystery would be

I haven’t seen Mia Farrow be this much of a weirdo before — she embodies the arrested development of her character and shifts tones deftly

Elizabeth Taylor is good when the emotions have to get big, but the needy person underneath is not as well developed

Mike Max (Bill Pullman) is a movie producer specializing in realistic and in-your-face violence. His fixation on work jeopardizes his relationship with his wife Paige (Andie MacDowell), but all that changes when two men abduct him to murder him. The next day, the two men are dead, and Mike is missing and is suspect number one

Ray (Gabriel Byrne) is a former NASA employee holed up in the Griffith Observatory, working on a top-secret surveillance project that promises to be “the end of violence.” But when footage of a murder goes missing, Ray begins to suspect his employers had a role in the murder, so he reaches out to the only person he can — movie producer Mike Max

On paper, the movie has some compelling ideas and could come out looking like<i> Enemy of the State</i> or <i>The Conversation</i> or, hell, <i>They Live</i>. What we get is a pastiche of Wim Wenders-esque road film, ponderous speeches on the nature of violence, and vestigial parts that feel underdeveloped or cut-worthy fodder in one more rewrite

Part of the disorientation is looking at pre-9/11 Surveillance State America through the lens of a German filmmaker. The meta text piles and compiles, and the resulting image feels outside of reality — maybe that’s why it gets Lynch comparisons?

I do think the movie manages to communicate a meaningful argument about the camera as a distancing device from violence, diluting reality into a story. Also, I believe that the third act intentionally succumbs to the Noir-like violence and covert operations — similar to <i>Adaptation</i>, the plot freezes without engaging the tropes it is critiquing

A facet of the story I wanted to see developed more was the invisibility of immigrants and how Mike could hide so well because he immersed himself with people that America does not care about. This idea is also touched on with the cleaning lady hired at Ray’s job that I won’t go into here

Cut another way, Mike frequently talks about his fear of a foreign attack, and for him, the end of that fear and the end of the violence that motivated him came through spending time with the Hispanic family

As Wenders is first a photographer, the cinematography is excellent and is the prime mechanism through which the film explores its themes

I wouldn’t call this a successful film, but I do think critics misunderstood what the movie did — and that is the fault of the film itself. Still, the film hooked me as I had no confidence in where the film was heading, but crafted well enough that I stuck around to find out

What can I say? It’s a surrealist masterpiece — Buñuel sharpens his focus from his earlier work and makes a critique of wealth and the state that is as relevant now as it was then

A big reason is that it does not explicitly reference any historical events or figures, but instead slowly says the quiet parts out loud: appeals to decency, moments of silence, calls for dispassionate rationality

It also captures the tensions felt during quarantine — the typhoid quarantine is explicitly referenced — the loss of control, the constant proximity, the indefinite length

The movie is shot in a rich, silver-tone black and white, giving every scene a sort of uncanny beauty. In addition, the film refrains from showing the more grotesque moments, letting the implications live before and after the cut

These distancing devices both help to give the movie a distinct tone, but they also ensure that we never feel too close to what is happening in front of us

The movie doesn’t stop escalating, cutting through time for vignettes of disturbing behavior and violence. In some ways, this allows the audience to fill in the gaps themselves. However, the structure also feels like a way to avoid the messy details of the story

The killer announces themselves through a series of threatening and harassing phone calls. More than once, a victim will call the police only to be told to get in line

It will surprise no one who has seen a movie that Tracy and the killer have an encounter, and it’s here that Jennifer Jason Leigh shows just how great an actor she is — and her first film role at that!

The movie makes several choices, never staying in one place too long, but follows Sharon through her spiritual journey of belief and doubt to a disturbing but logical conclusion

2023-07-21,Dunkirk,2017,https://boxd.it/4y23rr,3,,"Based on a historical event during WWII, Dunkirk is a technical exercise in narrative construction in which three perspectives occupy different lengths of time — one week of land, one day of sea, and one hour of air — and meet each other in their passing

Incidentally, humans are participants during the events, some named, and disasters befall them. If any political or tactical motive is at play, they are intentionally withheld or dismissed, lest the war move gets bogged down with politics. The pawns move across the screen, some are killed, and others survive — ants marching

For long swaths of the movie, nothing, in particular, happens to people onscreen other than migration from one historical point to another. To make up for this, Hans Zimmer joined Nolan in high concept by utilizing Risset rhythms to create the illusion of a constantly increasing tempo

The color grading is a specific blue that remains noticeable and distracting throughout, relenting only when night and indoor scenes allow it. The cinematography is notably less spartan than in previous Nolan attempts, perhaps by the technical requirement of having so many characters onscreen. While the moments at sea had some tensions, the scenes from the sky are so vacant that practically every plane crash feels flat and meaningless

The movie does not consider the emotional weight of what’s onscreen, so when characters have change-of-hearts or begin to cry, it seems to erupt from nowhere — a signal for the audience unmotivated by a stimulus. Harry Styles is an absolute train wreck in this, and 

One thing is certain: this is a technical marvel. The tight script and coordination of action are precise, and the moments in which the stories overlap bring you to attention. The in-camera explosions are big, the planes are in the sky, no filmmaking choice is left to chance or lacks intent

Unlike most rape revenge movies, this one starts well after the revenge has started and escalated to a project that has taken over these women’s lives, and how despite their best intentions, innocent people end up hurt or killed

2023-07-23,Images,1972,https://boxd.it/4yWFGV,4,,"<blockquote><i>I won’t be able to finish this puzzle — there’s too many pieces missing</i></blockquote>Cathryn (Susannah York) is talking to a friend on the phone when another voice comes on, claiming to be someone sleeping with her husband, Hugh (René Auberjonois). When he comes home — having not slept with someone else — to find her distraught, they decide to go to Cathryn’s family home in the country for some rest

Whether this Cathryn makes it there, we aren’t sure, as the camera jumps from the Cathryn we’ve been following, standing on a cliff, to another Cathryn unpacking the car and moving in

Compression of space and memory begins as Cathryn sees Hugh transform into a French lover René (Marcel Bozzuffi), who may or may not have existed, and back again. Hugh runs into Marcel (Hugh Millais) and his daughter Susannah (Cathryn Harrison). Marcel continues to make advances on her, and Susannah bears more than a passing resemblance to Cathryn’s childhood photos

Susannah plays Cathryn, Cathryn plays Susannah, René plays Hugh, Hugh plays Marcel, and Marcel plays René

Throughout the movie, Cathryn recites a children’s book in her head — one we, the audience, believe she is writing. The words, however, are from Susannah York’s book, <i>In Search of Unicorns</i>

First and foremost, the movie is about doubling and identity and the parts of ourselves that we try to hide away but manifest in other ways

Most readings over the movie treat Cathryn’s behavior as a form of schizophrenia. While I think that works — and that the film, by design, doesn’t have one interpretation — I read it in a less literal form

I see Cathryn as a woman afraid her husband might be cheating on her because he doesn’t sleep with her anymore, and she has a history of infidelity that he doesn’t know about, so the fear that Hugh may find out haunts her. It gets in the way of her loving her husband the way she wants to

While I like a lot about this movie, I think that Altman’s later approach to these concepts, <i>3 Women</i>, is more successful as a multifaceted, interpretive piece. Unlike this movie, where reality peels apart,<i> 3 Women</i> sees the world fully transformed and sublimated to something wholly other

The score is eerie and edgy, in large part because the collaboration between John Williams and Stomu Yamashta fits together in such an unusual way, one canceling out the other, negating, merging, compressing

Years later, Julia is a teacher for deaf children, and Mary is in an institution, severely disfigured from some disease — clearly, an excuse to have two different-looking actors on screen. Mary manages to escape, reconnect with her dog somehow, and sics the dog on a killing spree — guests for the birthday party

This movie kills indiscriminately — one of the victims is one of Julia’s deaf pupils. Notably, it takes time for the kids in her class to mourn his death and talk about what they liked about him, and it’s such a genuinely affecting scene

The movie clumsily introduces a friend an hour in to go and stay with Julia so that the friend can be murdered instead of Julia. And, of course, this friend is blonde and beautiful and walks around the house in just a shirt

The third act is so similar to <i>Happy Birthday to Me</i> that it deflated a bit for me. Add to that the terrible blocking and structure, and it falls apart.

At an award show in his honor, someone murders his fiancé in a fashion identical to one of Dr. Death's. Distraught, he steps away from the limelight and goes into a mental health facility

Some years later, Toombes' friend and the writer/creator of Dr.  Death, Herbert Flay (Peter Cushing), reaches out to him for the opportunity to reprise his Dr. Death role. But no sooner than he begins filming, the murders start happening again, leaving Toombes' horrified that he may be doing them and not realizing it

The film is standard fare for Price and Cushing, and the prospect of them working on a film together is more exciting than the execution. The movie contains several clips from old Vincent Price flicks, and seeing those juxtaposed with the movie itself does it no favors

Sarah (Amy Seimetz) is three months into AA, still dealing with her past mistakes as an alcoholic. In AA, she meets fellow alcoholic Kevin (Joe Swanberg), with whom she begins a relationship

The movie has two threads — Garrick's and Sarah's. Garrick's story is non-linear, jumping to moments before prison and after his escape — his journey feels like a hazy phantom on the edge. Sarah's is told linearly but is frequently interrupted by Garrick's story

Thematically, the movie explores guilt and regret and how we choose to move on from it

Amy Seimetz is perfect as Sarah, adding a layer of fragility and apprehension that sits just beneath the surface — she doesn't trust herself anymore, and anything, even if it feels right, is a calculated risk

I warmed to AJ Bowen as the movie progressed — whatever direction he received in the early scenes did not communicate character, so for the first act, he feels like just some guy. As we spend time with Garrick, we see someone who is ultimately ashamed of his drive to murder — it is a compulsion more than a want

In the end, it was the awful directing and narrative choices that kept me from appreciating anything beyond the two leads. The killing just felt like a hyperbolic way of communicating abuse and seemed only there to be shocking. The cinematography is unmotivated in its now cliche mumblecore shake

When she refuses to sleep with a patron, Tony takes one of her eyes with a scalpel, making her an eccentric option for the more demented clientele

Of course, she will get her revenge, but not before training in martial arts, weapons, and driving

Do you want your gunshots to seem more realistic? Use live ammunition. Do you want your rape scenes to stick in the viewer's mind? Film actual penetrative sex. Do you want the eye-stabbing scene to have more impact? Stab an actual eye (in this case, a cadaver's)

This movie fulfills much of the pulp promised by exploitation — rape, revenge, shoot-outs, duels, car chases with a hilarious number of explosions, and slow-motion for days so that each bullet, each kick to face, has full impact

2023-07-27,Peeping Tom,1960,https://boxd.it/4ADaVv,4.5,,"<blockquote><i>— Anyone with you?
— No, just my camera.</i></blockquote>Mark Lewis (Carl Boehm) is a man obsessed with terror, driven to capture it on camera. To fulfill his desire, he finds women to murder and films their dying expression

Mark's neighbor, Helen (Anna Massey), lives with her blind mother (Maxine Audley) and has a crush on Mark. Mark and Helen grow closer, with Mark determined that she never be one of his victims, but Helen's mother senses something off about Mark that no one else sees

<blockquote><i>I don't trust a man who walks quietly.</i></blockquote>Compared to <i>Camera Buff</i>, both movies are about men obsessed with the camera's ability to make sense of their lives. The warning is less subtle here, but both explore the isolating and masturbatory nature of the camera — the way the camera does not capture life but interferes with it, perhaps taking it away

Here, the camera itself is the weapon — one leg of the tripod hides a blade. For each murder, the knife is extended in front of the camera so that the lens can capture the faces at the moment of death

The movie does not avoid discussing the neurosis at play — the role of Mark's father in introducing him to constant fear and filming, as well as Mark's awareness of what he is and what he does, acting not on pure pleasure but on compulsion. And, I mean, a camera with a protruding blade is maybe the most overtly phallic weapon conceived on film

The movie also layers the reflective nature at play with the murder. We are watching, and thereby participating, in the murders — perhaps the underlying reason the film was critically panned and ended Powell's career. But also, characters photograph each other photographing each other. And most importantly, one more facet of the camera weapon that is left unknown until the final scene

Powell's command of color already elevates the movie into a hyper-real space. The opening scene, where Mark picks up a sex worker, looks like a sound stage. The world is aglow with deep reds and greens at the edges of darkness. Helen's blue dress is so rich that it demands your attention

Speaking of Helen, Anna Massey's performance is incredible. She reflects the whole world of emotions on her face, making Mark's interest in her all the more believable

Carl Boehm's performance is so repressed, on edge, barely able to let emotion leak out the sides
of his locked expression of neutrality

<blockquote><i>Whatever I photograph, I always lose.</i></blockquote>Overall, this movie holds the blueprint for the American slasher, complete with our ""final girl,"" Helen. While I didn't find an emotional connection that would make me love this movie, I appreciate just about every choice this movie makes

The story is reminiscent — perhaps too much so — of the video game <i>Dead Space</i> (at least according to my friend Kyle), except instead of drilling on an alien planet, they're mining in the all too alien Mariana Trench

The movie leans on TJ Miller for comedic relief way too often — once every 2-3 lines — and so his death (spoiler alert, this is a horror movie) is a relief. However, left to only focus on the film itself, it becomes clear just how out of focus the whole thing is

The movie gives us the survival mission in the first act — get to the [maguffin] — and draws out the path on a map. But once on the trip, the action is so disoriented, so sloppy, that all the tension is lost as we ask, ""Wait, what just happened? How did this person die? Where are they now? Who is that?""

We get an ""oh my god"" reveal, and I cannot tell what it is. The filmmakers have zero confidence in their special effects

everyone mumbles too much — I had the movie deafeningly loud to try and make out the dialogue — this is in scenes with no action, those lulls between the action

Do you have a jack I can borrow?</i></blockquote>I watched the R-rated version, and it's hard to imagine that the excised gore and viscera would have made a significant difference in my rating of this

Jack is an architect. Or Jack is an engineer who aspires to be an architect. Regardless, Jack is also a serial killer

Jack is Lars Von Trier, who has built a career out of other's misery, in conversation with himself as Virgil from <i>Dante's Inferno</i>, recalling five murder moments as Virgil guides him to hell

There's no connective tissue between murders, no patterns beyond the need to film it — that <i>Peeping Tom</i> fetishization of constructing the perfect image — that <i>Hannibal</i> obsession with elevating death to art

A couple of points, the movie achieves legitimately funny black humor — Jack tries to leave a murder scene, but his OCD is so pronounced that he keeps going back in and cleaning — but those moments wash away in grim naval gazing

Once it digressed into the endless rant on wine, decay, and how iconic Mussolini and Hitler's ""artworks"" are, I got so bored. Using footage from <i>Night and Fog</i> to provoke is so childish — it just reminds me of the boys in high school who made Nazi jokes to be edgy

The movie isn't inherently flawed — the performances are all great, and some of the cinematography is striking — some shots are unlike anything I can recall seeing. Also, I like the idea of a serial killer recounting his life to Virgil

Without her memories, Robert becomes her whole world, and she has sex with him. But it doesn't take long after he leaves for the memory to fade — At least for the moment

The movie explores the slow decay of time, the endless present — life without memory, leaving you fragile and unable to move through the world. In some way, it might be too successful, as the first half of the movie seems to drag on

As the movie progresses, we learn more about the why of the memory loss and that there are others like her, but the film devolves into long monologues to explain everything, leaving an uneven experience

Riddled with grief and guilt, she leaves her husband, Magnus (Keir Dullea), and moves into a large, mysterious house

In the house, she experiences a presence she initially believes to be the ghost of her daughter, but is a girl who used to live there named Olivia — a girl who was capable of convincing anyone to do anything, even murder

The movie functions well as a collection of ghost movie tropes, many of which persist — the plot reminds me a lot of <i>Ringu</i> in terms of a ghostly child presence

Mia Farrow's desperation, her fluctuations between deep sadness and unmotivated giddiness, keep the movie afloat, especially when the scenes of her looking for answers stretch beyond their necessary length

The cinematography is mechanical, but for some choice scenes — perhaps those with ghostly presence? — the camera artfully composes and staggers through the scene, unveiling just what the audience needs to see

I wouldn't say I love this movie, but I do like some of the atmospheric choices. Still, probably not worth checking out unless you're, like me, completing Mia Farrow's motherhood trilogy (the other two being <i>Secret Ceremony</i> and, of course, <i>Rosemary's Baby</i>)","torrent, house of psychotic women, canuxploitation",2023-08-01

But when the three men leave prison, they each visit Chihiro, throwing her life into chaos, physically and psychologically abusing her. And so, she murders each one, buying a freezer to keep their bodies in. Her revenge, however, has frozen her in place, tending to the bodies she keeps on ice

What works best for me is the structure of the story — we spend quite a bit of time with the lead after she gets her revenge

Unfortunately, the freezer bit quickly becomes hammy as she talks to the bodies or reaches by one to grab an ice cream — the movie didn't need to focus dourly on the trauma, but it could do less trivializing of the entire experience

Later, Jean-Louis runs into Vidal (Antoine Vitez), an old school friend he hasn't seen in years. Vidal invites him to spend an evening with a fling of his named Maude (Françoise Fabian)

There, the three discuss religion, Pascal, and how chance and probability factor into their worldview — Vidal believes that taking a risk, even if the odds are against him, is what expands life and its possibilities — Jean-Louis believes that luck has predestined his choices so that they sufficiently fit with his morality. Vidal ducks out early, leaving Jean-Louis and Maude to continue their conversation and spend the night together 

Making a movie with such a long continuous conversation is hard to keep compelling, but this script lets things swing from philosophical to idle chat so deftly and convincingly

The movie feels so spontaneous like they decided on scenes as they went depending on weather and circumstances, but the whole film is so well structured, and the script is so sharp

The acting is pretty bad, and the story is almost non-existent, with just enough peppered into service what is mostly a movie of Paul running around performing stunt fight moves they could teach the actor in a day

The third act goes hard on the gore. Being a Brian Yuzna production, the practical effects look good and wet, but the CGI was just too ambitious for 2001, especially on whatever micro-budget they made this

Her husband Nicholas (Vincent Price) and Nicholas' sister Catherine (Luana Anders), however, remain unyielding in revealing the details of her death. And so, Francis stays at the Castle to learn what he can

We learn that Nicholas' father, Sebastian, was one of the most notorious torturers during the Inquisition. They believe that Elizabeth saw Sebastian's torture chamber and succumbed to the sinister spirit of the castle

One night, Nicholas goes missing, and harpsichord music fills the house — the same style Elizabeth played. Nicholas worries that perhaps she was not dead when they walled her up

John Kerr is goofy and out of place, but Price plays it up enough that it's not a deterrent

If the police don't defend us, maybe we ought to do it ourselves</i></blockquote>Some ""freaks"" break into the Kersey household, beat Joanna (Hope Lange) to death, and rape Carol (Kathleen Tolan), Joanna's daughter

Paul (Charles Bronson), Joanna's husband, loses hope in the system when they cannot promise that they can catch the ""freaks"" — ""they're just statistics on a police blotter,"" as his son-in-law says. So, he drinks a tall glass of milk, fills a sock with some quarters, and, bit by bit, goes apeshit

When work takes him to Tucson, Paul watches a Western park shootout — West West justice. His client invites him to a shooting range, and he recalls losing his father in a hunting accident and being a conscientious objector in Vietnam. The client encourages him to bring their country ethos with him back to the city

Charles Bronson isn't a great actor — his stoic demeanor works best in Westerns — but this role works for him as someone who has done everything he can not to kill but has the capacity within him, similar to Viggo Mortensen in <i>A History of Violence</i>, but in the opposite direction

Winner tries to go for something more mainstream and less exploitation than similar genre fare, motivating every step Paul takes towards vigilante justice. I won't say he is successful in making a great film, but it is well-structured, well-filmed, and internally consistent

The movie's strongest thematic point is that the police are useless and that they are far more interested in appearing successful in addressing crime than actually addressing it — in no small part because their means of solving crime doesn't work

I think it is trying to land in an ambiguous place — there's too much time hearing arguments against ""frontier justice"" to think otherwise — but the movie also cannot help but frame Bronson as a hero. From what I understand, future entries in the series are more unambiguously pro-Bronson

Solid Herbie Hancock soundtrack — the subtle energy keeps the movie moving forward in its slower parts

It's fun to see older movies where everyone is sleazy — it's still a style of storytelling that polarizes audiences — they feel like they're supposed to cheer for someone, but everyone sucks. This movie, whether intentional or not, is a critique of business and how it sews deception into people's being — you fucked me over and were rewarded for it? Well, now it's my turn

And what makes it work is that you get caught up in the grift, and the ending feels like a victory until the credits roll, and she becomes just another window in just another skyscraper

This movie is not the original Halloween, so that it favors gore over suspense is not a detriment but a stylistic choice — the dread remains, less as ""what's going to happen?"" and more as ""how bad is it going to be?""

That said, the rest of the movie plays out close to the original — with the ""Laurie being Michael's sister"" stuff from the second one weaved in — so in that sense, it's hard to feel that much tension

Also, for a movie so heavy on backstory, it doesn't consider answering why Michael is immortal, or at least hinting that he is before he gets shot in the chest and walks away. Not that I want that — it's just interesting

I get why this is so divisive — from a purely aesthetic viewpoint, this is as exploitative as it gets in the mainstream. And being in that position isn't what Rob Zombie wants — it's only because of his music career that his movies have

I like the aesthetic, but the story is so similar to <i>The Pit and the Pendulum</i>. The progression of the story has no meaningful development, at least nothing you can't assume once the movie establishes the lead's delusion 

The absence of Vincent Price is my disappointment and not a flaw of the movie, but it leaves me wondering if I would've liked it more if Price played Ray Milland's role

Still, this has all the bearings of a comfort movie for me, so I still enjoyed it

The visuals in this are so trippy and striking — the posterized sequences are successful at conveying that bleeding of reality that comes with contact with The Old Ones

Unfortunately, the visuals are the only reason to watch this. The story is tedious, and no one is on their acting game — even veteran Ed Begley is phoning it in for this; I assumed Dean Stockwell is doing his best, but he's always been pretty meh (don't come at me <i>Quantum Leap</i>ers<i>)</i> — and at 87 minutes, the movie is still too long for the story

The movie is well-paced, but the near real-time progression is almost maddening, but I guess that's the intent

Lichen on the flowers, lichen on the scar across her stomach — the symbiotic relationship forms, the island collects her past, and the island offers up its memory in return

This movie is the original version on which they based the stage musical, on which they based the 80s Frank Oz version

Besides the songs — and Rick Moranis — the original has all the dark humor and farcical fun of the 80s version and more. And, if I'm being honest, I don't love the songs from the other version, so this one works better for me

They meet up with Philippe's girlfriend, Marge Duval (Marie Laforêt), to go sailing, and Tom witnesses the hot-cold relationship between Philippe and Marge. After a fight in which Philippe destroys Marge's writing, they drop off Marge, leaving Tom and Philippe alone together, where we learn Tom's true nature

Beautiful locales, expensive clothes, attractive boys — the film invites you into the spoils of its rich characters, letting you consider what lengths you would go to live this type of life

Alain Delon is perfect as Tom Ripley — he's a great actor but is also pretty enough that you can believe his charm and what it grants him

It's funny how the movie is functionally right-wing — the message is that violence mediated through media DOES beget violence — but Cronenberg's lens when playing devil's advocate turns so subjective that viewers can build whatever they want out of the wetware

""Long live the new flesh"" is the spinning top at the end of the movie — a phrase that feels meaningful, but in this existential nightmare, all flesh ends at death, and so the phrase is irrelevant — Max's interpretation is that he must die so that the new flesh lives, but why should we trust anything he says or thinks?

While there, we fluidly transition from present to past and back with memories of growing up in the house with a mother dedicated to decadent sex parties and not much else. The only stern parenting he seems to receive is when his mother catches him masturbating while she tells him a bedtime story

His's mother's transparent dress that he hides underneath, the slip under which he slides his hand, the garter that he keeps to smell as he sucks his thumb; there is nothing subtle here, but the line between brazen and artless lives in the execution

The grandmother functions as a surrogate mother, teaching him to despise people but to leave something in tack to take from them — raising a boy who can never distinguish between tears and laughter

Jean (Rosy McEwen) is a PE teacher at a secondary school. There, and with her family, she is closeted. Her only outlet is a gay bar she regulars with friends and her girlfriend Viv (Kerrie Hayes)

A new student named Lois (Lucy Halliday) starts at Jean's school. Later, she spots Lois at the same gay bar she frequents. Terrified, she tries to manage her life to avoid suspicion, fearing that the school discovering her being a lesbian may be the end of her teaching career for good

Jean exemplifies the ""keep it to yourself"" gay that conservatives wish all queer people would adopt. As a result, her life and her relationships are fragile. She moves through life in perpetual fight-or-flight, and the misery she carries inside can only pour outward

Subject-wise, we're in well-trodden territory, but the film finds a way to navigate it that is novel and heartbreaking

The movie makes stellar song choices to play at the gay bar. The score is gorgeous, although it does manage to swallow some scenes — a nitpick that will likely bother me and no one else

The filmmaking is sharp, and the pacing is on point — this isn't an easy watch subject-wise, but the movie won't add to that in any structural way

2023-08-22,The Souvenir: Part II,2021,https://boxd.it/4JxCu7,4,,"<i>The Souvenir</i> is that frustrating and too-common story of a terrible man having a chokehold on Julie's life and creative work. <i>Part I</i> explored his living shadow and the excuses codependent lovers make for their addict partners. <i>Part II </i>follows his overdose and Julie's time in film school as she is making her student film and moving on

I remember liking <i>Part I </i>but being frustrated by its sparseness, not finding a deeper emotional connection. <i>Part II </i>functions in part as a meta-criticism of that sparseness as Julie makes her student film, — called The Souvenir — the school board criticizes her script for similar reasons

And the school board is proven right, at least initially — the movie is difficult to watch because you are seeing a director who is too close to the material, too cut off from the emotional pain, to keep everyone on the same page

But, as many filmmakers can attest: somehow, we get to the end, and a movie is made. The climactic sequence is unexpected, and I'm unsure how I feel about it, but I think I like it

The film is a rare case of the sequel enhancing the original — <i>Part I </i>needs <i>Part II</i> to complete it, to give it shape and direction

With Julie's father's passing, she hopes to spend time with her mother and gather memories for a film about their relationship

Rosalind is nostalgic, remembering occurrences from the house and holding onto old cards and keepsakes. But alongside those happy memories are also dark moments from her life

Julie remains unsettled from the moment she arrives, with the concierge being rude and dismissive and the building full of creaks and bumps that keep her up all night. With each dark memory she draws from her mother, their relationship grows tense

Julie and Rosalind are also the names of Honor Swinton Byrne and Tilda Swinton's characters in <i>The Souvenir</i>, so you can view this as <i>The Souvenir III</i>, although the story is much later in Julie's life

Worse still, she tries to get help for him, but medical doctors say he's fine, and her husband, Franklin (John C. Riley), does not believe her

But the film is not interested in giving easy answers. Eva is not a great mother and resents the stubborn aggression Kevin shows her that he doesn't to Franklin. It is impossible to know if Kevin would have turned out differently otherwise

The movie starts in the present day, where we see the fallout of an unknown crime that Kevin committed, her house splattered with red paint. Eva's life is in shambles, and she can barely walk the streets without stares or harassment. Through her flashback and memories, we see Eva and Kevin's tortured relationship, zero in on what happened, and maybe learn why

Ramsey is a patient filmmaker, and her ability to keep the tension tight and prolonged makes the story hit that much harder

Ezra Miller is pretty bad in this. It's telling when the kid that plays the younger Kevin pulls off a more nuanced performance. All Miller brought was a furrowed brow

Still, a small problem in an otherwise excellent movie

Lounging at their pool, Marianne (Romy Schneider) gets a phone call from Harry (Maurice Ronet), saying he is going to visit, leaving Jean-Paul (Alain Delon) a little jealous due to her and Harry's supposed past

<blockquote><i>You talk about all the others but never about Harry</i></blockquote>Harry comes with his daughter, Penelope (Jane Birkin), and Jean-Paul tries to hide that he is smitten

<blockquote><i>— Pretty, isn't she?
</i><i>— Not bad</i></blockquote>Marianne tries to be open to Jean-Paul hooking up with Penelope, perhaps because she doesn't want to feel guilt in pursuing Harry, especially when she spends so much time assuring Jean-Paul that the two have no history. Jean-Paul refuses to acknowledge his feelings, trying to hide them from everyone, including himself

<blockquote><i>You're a Pisces with an Aquarius rising — you were born to be loved, but you don't realize it</i></blockquote>It's clear the influence this has had on thrillers — several parts made me think of the second season of <i>White Lotus</i> and a few of <i>Sexy Beast</i> — and for good reason. The filmmakers let the tensions grow until the unspoken must be spoken, and everything changes

Great performances, a beautiful setting, and hot chemistry between everyone — it helps that Delon and Schneider dated for a while before this. Jane Birkin is almost too good at playing younger, to where I thought, ""Jean-Paul, what do you see here?"" but I guess French dudes are historically ""like that.""

If I had one complaint, it's that the pacing, while well-done, feels a bit slow for me — if some scenes progressed a little faster and the movie was a little tighter, it would be more effective for me

Film noir loves giving a crooked man one last shot at redemption, so Skip McCoy may get the opportunity to become a Citizen of the USA  🇺🇸 If he'd just come clean

<blockquote><i>— Do you know what treason means?

The meat here is the long shots and the sweaty close-ups, giving the actors time to develop emotion over time and for scenes to quietly build up tension — a stylistic choice that Bresson later borrows for his film <i>Pickpocket</i>

The choreography for the fights is also pretty great, and the coverage on it is fantastic

<blockquote><i>I'm going to cry, and it's not going to make any sense, and I'm sorry</i></blockquote>Then, one evening, while playing the piano, she feels like Jamie has picked up his cello and is playing beside her. And he is — he has returned as a ghost, having ""not died properly.""

<blockquote><i>Death shall have no dominion — we know that, you and me</i></blockquote>As her home life reshapes to accommodate Jamie, she begins remembering all the annoyances and fights that ross-colored memories couldn't remember. As if that weren't enough, she begins to develop feelings for a living person

Coming out the same year as <i>Ghost</i> and sharing a common plot point of a dead lover returning set this movie up for unnecessary comparisons because those two points are their only similarities

The pacing of the movie is strange and quiet, and it took me most of the runtime to adjust to it — it begins where many movies might climax: the recognition of loss and all the pain that follows

We get droplets of her life, but nothing is moving in any particular direction — just the constant remembering of Jamie interrupting her life. Then, when he returns, there isn't any triumph — they play music together and have idle conversations, playing those ""I love you more"" games

I don't remember a film shifting from annoying me to moving me the way this movie did. Maybe because it found its way into my memories and experiences and helped me reflect on the grief I have been experiencing for a while now. It reminded me that I don't have to be in any particular place with grief — I only need to keep going

Later, Locke discovers Robertson dead in his room. So, Locke switches out their passports, changes clothes, and reports to the hostel that David Locke is dead

Locke soon learns that he has assumed the identity of an arms dealer supplying the guerrillas and that his life may be in danger. The role pays handsomely, but the cost of playing it is high

The film is a study of a man who has no politics — a ""philosophical detachment"" as the obituary — assuming the role of someone with such strong beliefs that he would put his life on the line for it

Locke believes his problem is his old habits and that even by becoming a passenger in someone else's life, he will still ""experience the same old codes."" But of course, once this life takes the steering wheel from him, all he can do is keep this identity's appointments

Antonioni's style translates brilliantly in some ways and disappointingly in others. His formal camera work and visual perfection work great, but his characters' philosophical musings feel less profound coming out of English-speaking mouths

Still, this is a satisfying blend of arthouse sensibilities and mainstream storytelling

Those lives come to a head when her sugar daddy shows up to the shiva with his wife and baby

The movie is a boiling pot of tension that induces ""ha ha"" laughs and ""omg"" laughs in equal measure.  Because it's not just Danielle's denial, but everyone's — not just her lies — that shake the foundations

We like to pretend that life all comes together in your 30s and everything smooths out, but we trade those anxieties with new ones. As long as people are in your life, you will have conflicts and misunderstandings with them. The lesson is not that the trouble goes away, but that it cannot stay hidden or else *boom*

Everyone is great in this — Rachel Sennott has slightly less oblivious Hannah Horvath energy. Molly Gordon has a permanent intensity that never lets any detail pass idly. Ted Melamed and Polly Draper are such frustrating parents — supportive, which may be why (at least in part) Danielle feels so stuck and unable to find the independence she craves

At times, the movie veers into tired misogynistic tropes — not one woman can support another without talking shit behind her back — but there is an argument for the movie having a subjective lens

Also, a few plot contrivances kink up the story thread, but they didn't take me out of it. Having seen the original short, I can see how much expansion of the central conceit the story required, and the filmmakers did a mostly great job

Instead of going directly to the police, they try to handle it themselves and make it so much worse. It is incredibly frustrating because of how understandable the process they take is, even if it is the wrong way

Lucas does still have support from his son and one of Lucas' friends, so it is not a hopeless spiral — it is a nuanced story full of humanity, for better or worse  — but that doesn't make the journey any less difficult

The film emphasizes the degree of intimacy required when working with Kindergartners and how that intimacy gets messy when the teacher reads as male

Both Trace Lysette and Patricia Clarkson give deeply vulnerable performances. They evade melodrama, communicating through the eyes, letting themselves express the weakness of dealing with all that you cannot control about your body

The film is predominantly static shots, often centering the lead. Shot in standard format, the reduced frame helps keep the movie feeling small and focused

The film's biggest weakness is how much it relies on improv. Several scenes fall into dead silence as the actors try to formulate a joke, and it is agonizing

Intentional or not, the film also (through gross racist caricature) explores colonialism and the ""taming the savage"" mentality that drove it, ""advancing"" other cultures by brutalizing and enslaving them.

A blind man named Robert owns the flat that Jane rents for her affair. Robert carries a flame for her — though she isn't interested, she still toys with him, bathing in front of him and flirting

After a year in a mental ward, Jane gets out and decides to move into the flat while she mourns Fred, making a shrine to him. Robert can hear her at night moaning Fred's name as though still in the throws of passion. In her freezer, she keeps a drawer locked that she regularly checks

The setup is solid, and the movie tries to prolong the inevitable by frequenting Robert's perspective. Perhaps the 80s audience was slower on the draw, but the journey to Robert's realization is a bit of a slog

The film takes an uncommon approach to the revenge flick in that it shows what happens when the old bullies are gone and how new bullies emerge, suggesting that as long as there is a power imbalance, some will want to subjugate others to their will

This movie influenced <i>Heathers</i>, and their third acts are both remarkably similar. <i>Heathers</i>, however, goes for a black humor that this movie could not pull off. That said, the absurdity of the revenge taken gets so over-the-top that it becomes funny — so many explosions!

One of the earliest and most influential American slashers, coming out just two months after <i>Friday the 13th,</i> the film has a slower pace and emphasizes character development over who left after kills as the means for the audience to guess the killer

As a result, the movie is not all that exciting of a movie to watch. Besides one iconic kill at the prom, the rest are tame, even by that time's standards. The teen drama elements are solid, though, and the disco-themed dance is delightful

Based on the circumstances surrounding the assassination of Grigoris Lambrakis, this influential film transformed political thrillers, incorporating documentary-style filming and the stories of factual events, giving the movie a greater sense of grounded reality

The result is a charged, frustrating, and sometimes comical circus of he said/she said —  government, police, military, and press corroborating in killing a political leader to halt a peaceful political movement and the few who just want the truth

But Soderberg’s inability to imagine human responses to trauma leaves the whole thing feeling cruel and sterile — the exception is a scene near the end, inexplicably scored by U2, that feels pulled from a different movie and appended

I would expect a lingering shot of a dead child covered in vomit or the camera making eye contact with a woman as doctors saw her skull open from an exploitation flick. In many ways, this is one

</i><i>— Save my life?
</i><i>— Give you a cigarette</i></blockquote><i>Gilda</i> is a movie where the subtext is the plot — who Ballin, Johnny, and Gilda are to each other is never explicitly stated. These relationships develop behind closed doors, and we only have the innuendos and suggestions to fill out the difference. Otherwise, it's a pretty rudimentary plot about a casino owner who has some illegal side dealings

The two men, Johnny and Ballin, are involved in some way — it's the queer power dynamic we see in movies like <i>Point Break</i>, where love may not be a part of it, but sex and attraction are at play. The film begins with Ballin cruising the docks — why there, except to meet a guy like Johnny?

Gilda and Johnny are both playing the same game: becoming ""kept"" to try and make their lives easier, but learning that jumping into bed with someone with power brings new difficulties. Johnny fights to protect Ballin, and Johnny is happiest when kept by Ballin

A female-produced movie — this film was Virginia Van Upp's assignment to make a Rita Hayworth vehicle — Gilda gets dimension that makes her appealing, not just as a sex symbol, but as a complex and vulnerable person — not quite a femme fatale, but not innocent either

As for the film itself, it is overall fantastic  — I do think several parts drag and that some of the choices made near the end are odd — but the performances are spectacular, and the filmmaking is sharp and meticulous. As you can tell, it’s a movie that’s more fun to talk about than to watch

<b>My favorite innuendos</b>
* The cane that shoots a blade — ""my little friend,"" as Ballin calls it
* Johnny holds a cigarette lighter at the hip, forcing Gilda to bend down and take a long drag on her cigarette to light it
* Both Gilda and Johnny use the line, ""I was born last night when you met me,"" on Ballin

<b>Stray Thoughts</b>
* Thanks to Eddie Muller, whose writing on the queer subtext in <i>Gilda</i> helped me formulate my thoughts on it
* How many hours to get Rita Hayworth's hair to look like that? Baz Lurhmann copied that style for Nichole Kidman for Moulin Rouge — and said that the hair is a big reason why movies like these are so expensive to make
* Hayworth makes zero effort at pretending to play the guitar, and I love it
* Scorsese compares this to <i>Pandora's Box</i>, the way Gilda is both guilty and innocent — aware of her power over men, yet cannot avoid drawing them in. It's a genuine coincidence that I watched them so close together","dvd, criterion",2023-09-07

As time goes on, Edna displays concerning behavior  while Sam tries to figure out what happened to Edna, and Kay relearns how to be around a mother she's grown distant from

The movie maintains a quiet timbre with jolts of sound (the dreaded downward slope audio mix) but does an adequate job of keeping the mood disquieting

The movie explores themes of generational trauma and the pains of growing older, as images of decay and changing space curl around the characters and the frustrations of shared experiences but not having the language to verbalize them

The real standouts here are the committed performances from the three leads. Each actor must wrestle with complex emotions while navigating unusual and disturbing situations

Her neighbor Andrea (Elizabeth Ashley) tries to help, but Emily opts to move from Brooklyn Heights to Manhattan

Soon after, we see Andrea sitting in the back of a taxi cab, listening to the tape recording the intruder recorded. Andrea continues to find moments with Emily, helping her move and inviting her for drinks. Her involvement and motivation are blatant — the question is the lengths she will go to get it

The only film Gordon Willis directed — he was the cinematographer for the <i>Godfather</i> trilogy, several Woody Allen films, and others. He later regretted making this, if only because he hated the emotional intelligence and time required for directing the actors. But what did he expect with such an emotionally fraught movie subject?

Of course, the movie looks remarkable — the close-up compositions provide subtext, and the camera deftly dictates space according to the character's emotional condition. There's a crossfade between a telescope view and slow-motion footage of a black-and-white romance that has major Lynch vibes

Talia Shire gives a heartbreaking performance despite being given little to work with. Elizabeth Ashley is appropriately horrifying, but why she does any of this is a mystery — the script seems to have little on its mind except “scary lesbian.”

The climax is way too long and silly — this didn't have a landing to stick, but it could have bowed out more gracefully than this

As she got older, she began to work at a funeral home, training in embalming. She learns secondhand that her teacher has sex with the young boys, so she tries the same

When Sandra meets Matt — a cute boy her age who is a medical student — she confesses that she ""makes love to corpses."" Matt is intrigued — red flag #1 — and they start dating

<i>Kissed</i> aims to give a human portrait, making the movie about Sandra first and her necrophilia as just one facet of her. The film goes out of its way to avoid the grosser aspects of her predilection intent on not scaring away audiences from the story

White light fills the screen when Sandra feels closer to crossing over: the mortuary light, the sun through a window as she opens her first casket, the Fassbinder-like explosion of white at her first kiss

We enter this world through a VOB named Kevin, whom Jessica's group finds and adopts. Just as we start learning anything about these boys, the Special Forces, represented by a swarm of drones, kill Kevin (aka our audience surrogate), and the boys run into hiding on an island

One of the boys, named Michael, meets Camille on the island. She likes his muscles (?), he tells her he has committed every atrocity imaginable, so they have sex and fall in love

Another boy named Lucas sees the ghost of his sister Andrea, whom he killed for no apparent reason — this seems to be Lucas' deal

The closest thing I can compare this to is <i>Only God Forgives</i>, where people stand around in silence and make speeches, all in beautiful cinematography. Why anything is happening is up in the air. Why the movie ends just before a proposed climax could only be attributed to budgetary restrictions — too much money spent on the lovely house they hide out in and the nice chandelier they break (?)

Georges is reluctant but sees potential and takes the lead

Twenty minutes in, the heist begins as the gang subdues and restrains the police, the fire brigade, and the telephone operators, ensuring the town is cut off from help. They divide up into teams and hit their marks, handling each new crisis as it arises. But troubles increase when Edgar sees someone he knows from town, Martens, and breaks from the heist

A near-lost film — everyone's watching the same copy: a rip from a damaged VHS — and I believe the Guggenheim was able to get a copy to show at one point, but otherwise, no one can get a legitimate version

The story is tense, and the troubles are fun. It manages to avoid any overt violence, making it all about the work of the heist. The stakes are still there, but it's almost like the lack of violence keeps the tension high — no catharsis, just the tightrope

Similarly, being in Acadamy ratio, the landscape of the mountain town does not come into play — we see the men at work, we see the town they are taking. It's a big heist, but the whole thing feels small and focused

When a book adaptation comes his way — ""all you gotta do is follow the book"" — he invites Mildred, the coat-girl at the restaurant who read it, over to his place so she can tell him what it's about. More than once, Laurel Grey, his neighbor from across the way, crosses their paths, taking Steele's attention from Mildred and the story. Ultimately, Mildred's description leaves him empty once more, so he pays her and sends her on her way

The next day, detective and former army pal Brub Nicholai ushers him downtown to provide an alibi — Mildred is dead, and he's the last to see her. Steele asks for Grey to corroborate his story. Though strangers at the onset, the two quickly fall in love. But as the murder investigation lingers, so too does Laurel's suspicions that Steele is not innocent

The film is difficult — Bogart's Dixon Steele is lonely in his violence, lonely as a writer who can't find a passion project, and lonely as a man without love — we carry sympathy for him, not because we are rooting for him but because we are hoping that this will be what changes him and makes him the person he wants to be: kind, loving, creative. In the end, he gets one of them

Gloria Grahame gives so much vitality to Laurel Gray — guarded yet romantic, flighty yet persistent — for better or worse, she could be the one who can put up with Steele's violent tendencies

As a contemporary audience member, it's impossible to root for Dixon and Laurel — everything inside us yearns for Laurel to escape and find someone better, less violent, more decisive at managing that misplaced drive

But love is cruel in how it chooses for us our romantic interests. And this isn't a morality play — it's the story of two people the world has hurt too many times

2023-09-15,The Tingler,1959,https://boxd.it/4QwEqH,3.5,,"<i>The Tingler</i> is the story of Dr. Warren Chapin (Vincent Price) investigating the effect of fear on the body. He believes that it is the scream that releases the deadly tension and that without the ability to scream, fear will shock you and perhaps kill you

With the help of his assistant David (Darryl Hickman), as well as a couple who own a silent movie theater — Ollie Higgins and his deaf/mute wife Martha — he learns that the shock felt in the body isn't just nerves, but a living creature that everyone has on their spine

The movie is delightfully dopey and over-the-top. The actors play their roles straight, but there is nothing serious about <i>The Tingler</i> and its ridiculous setup

Only Vincent Price could sell the absurdity of <i>The Tingler</i> with such conviction, and it's his commitment that keeps everyone on board

In some ways, the movie is a loving homage to the power of silent films — we see an extended sequence from one in the theater, as well as several moments with Martha, whose muteness prevents her screaming, so every moment of horror must be visual

While William Castle made his career out of being a campier Hitchcock, he finds an approach here that transcends the comparisons and has fun

We then see Miriam (Karen Black) and her husband, Greg (George Hamilton), on their way to a funeral. They walk down the aisle to the casket, Miriam desperate to turn around. The walk takes ages and ages before Miriam sees Greg is not Greg. He walks over to open the casket, and Miriam sees herself in it

After Miriam wakes up from this nightmare — she feels out of sorts. She tells her husband in no uncertain terms that she thinks the dream is about her feelings regarding being a housewife
<blockquote><i>I think it means I'm dying inside</i></blockquote>When left to her own, Miriam finds herself taking trips that she only vaguely notices — to the mall, where she buys a red blouse and a blonde wig
<blockquote><i>it's you, honey — it's really you</i></blockquote>Then, she drives to the beach, where she rents a house with her own money, and to a bar, where everyone swears she looks just like their old friend Sandy

The film carries more twists and turns as it goes, but never to a play outside the logic of the narrative

You can read the film as a queer/trans allegory — Miriam feels like she isn't herself, and if she stays who she is, she will die. She begins a slow transition, trying it out on her husband but feeling shame and fear when he isn't on board
<blockquote><i>it just isn't you</i></blockquote>Nevertheless, everything inside her tells her that she must change, and each one feels more natural as if she is remembering who she is supposed to be

A minister asks a boy who is going there for work to check in on his daughter, who he heard drinking too much sacramental wine

In Reykjavik, the British have overrun the city, mocking him and his backwater ways (aka drinking milk on the job site). While on the job, he meets a peculiar British soldier named Tilbury, who gives him a bar of chocolate

Later, he spots the daughter — who we learn that he's had a crush on since childhood — cavorting with Tilbury, sending him into a rage (referring to a historical phenomenon called Ástandið)

Tilbury's weird behavior — climbing through pipes, puking up buttermilk, and squealing like a pig — leads the boy to suspect that Tilbury is a tiiberi: an imp of Icelandic lore who steals milk for its summoner

This movie is a hard one to pin down. And it does quite a bit despite being just under an hour. I don't think it makes excellent use of that time, and I feel like parts of it are Icelandic references that I'm missing

2023-09-18,The Lady from Shanghai,1947,https://boxd.it/4Rp6Rz,2,,"<blockquote><i>When I start out to make a fool of myself, there's very little can stop me</i></blockquote>Orson Welles plays Black Irish Michael O'Hara, a man known for... killing a guy? He sees Elsa Bannister (Rita Hayworth) in a passing carriage,  and his fixation seals his fate... until it doesn't? Elsa pulls Michael into her world of mistrust and malaise... well, pretend malaise so that... they can commit crimes?

From there, the plot fractures like the broken glass motif that was definitely intentional. But if you're one of the revisionist fans of this, the plot isn't the essential part

Welles dons a godawful Irish accent that, like his filmmaking descendant Kevin Costner, he only does when he remembers. His voice fills all the nooks and crannies where subtext or ambiguity may have forgiven the mishmash the movie becomes. At times, the narration tries to tie the plot together, but like a giallo, it has to keep twisting and lose any semblance of meaning

On-screen, Welles furrows his brow, dons a half-smile, and recites his lines as though they were by Yeats. That is until the movie manages to find a pace, and acting precludes empty posturing

Hayworth has so little a character beyond damsel, but she injects texture in her performance wherever possible. It's a pity Welles forced her to cut her hair and dye it blonde for the role

If the film has any success, it is in the camerawork — the visual storytelling does everything possible to steer this drunken ship away from the rocks. Along with Viola Lawrence's economic editing, these pictorial efforts render something approaching coherent, like a collage of elements ripped out and glued together

Don't let me sell the cinematography short — it is stunning in places and full of trick shots that surprise and fulfill what the rest of the movie cannot. My favorite scenes are in the aquarium and the ""wow them in the end"" solution of the incredible funhouse sequence leading into the iconic Hall of Mirrors scene. I also enjoyed the shots where it looked like the lens shattered due to impact or bullets

Whether or not you like this will have to do with what you prioritize in a movie experience. If you can turn off and enjoy the visuals, there's plenty to appreciate in the cinematography and set pieces. But the moment acting, dialogue, story, or pacing enter the conversation, this is a frustrating mess

For some critics, the horseshoe swings this over to an accidental masterpiece. For me, it doesn't quite make the curve

<b>Stray Thoughts</b>
* The DVD case I rented puts a 3.5-star review on it — the most praise-worthy statement they could find is ""vintage Welles.""
* Of course, Scorsese loves this movie — his style is deeply indebted to this, and all of his worst habits are on display here — long takes for the sake of it, endless narration, visual flourishes to mask lack of other ideas
* William Castle had the rights to the adaptation, but Welles manipulated him into an uncredited screenplay role
* The courtroom scene is so silly — it is amusing, but what does it serve? Everyone is laughing and yelling, and the judge is a bumbling idiot, all done for comedic effect. It seems Welles has an ax to grind over divorce lawyers that was more important to him than the coherence of his picture
* Bogdanovich has done a remarkable job at Welles speculative revisionist history. He paints Hayworth as a disturbed woman that Welles did everything he could to help, and Welles as someone who only makes great movies, if only the studios wouldn't get in the way","dvd, 1001 movies, scorsese's 85 film",2023-09-17
2023-09-18,Broadcast News,1987,https://boxd.it/4RujPr,4,,"Tom grew up afraid that being good-looking and dumb wouldn't get him anywhere. Aaron knew he was smarter than everyone else and thought that was the ticket to getting everything he wanted. From childhood, Jane gave herself self-imposed deadlines, keeping herself too busy to worry

<blockquote><i>what can you do with yourself if all you can do is look good?</i></blockquote>As adults, Jane and Aaron are best friends who also work together on a national TV network — Jane is Liz Lemon: an intense producer whose work defines her life and who has never been wrong about anything (according to her) — Aaron is Pete Horberger: a clever and talented writer who lacks the social skills to get any higher at work

<blockquote><i>Ok, I'll meet you at the place near the thing where we went that time</i></blockquote>The two share a disdain for the sensationalist direction news is heading. Tom — think Drew Baird (Jon Hamm), but blonde — shows up as a green news anchor and begs for Jane to help him improve

<blockquote><i>except for socially, you're my role model</i></blockquote>Their chemistry is dynamite, and they produce what they consider convincing television, which leads to the two falling for each other (in their own way). Meanwhile, Aaron is discovering his feelings for Jane, and their relationship suffers as a result

<blockquote><i>— it must be nice to always believe you know better — to always think you're the smartest person in the room
— no ifs awful</i></blockquote>The film deals with TV news but has a decidedly unmotivated political bent — diet neolib, if you will. But in part, that's because this movie is about these
three people, and how their work defines their relationships to other people. Every moment has the possibility of a breaking story, and they have to pick up where they are

<blockquote><i>Sorry... sex, tears... this must be the news</i></blockquote>So it makes sense that the characters are looking to the people they work with as potential partners — who else are they meeting? And it also makes sense that they don't know each other outside of their roles at work — there's a difference between a producer yelling at an anchor and a lover's spat (I've never said ""lover's spat"" in my life, but I couldn't help myself)

When the film is at its best, it focuses on the real-time production and airing of a news program. Experts/episodes of <i>30 Rock</i> have taught me that the intensity and breakneck pacing is accurate. The film, however, flails a bit when it tries to work out the characters, although it hides it behind plot, arguments, and a sweeping romantic score

But here's the core they start and never give its due: when the world quiets down and Jane has nothing to work on, she cries. Now, maybe it's supposed to be a humorous thing for her character. But to me, it reads like Jane needs something to change in her life

Still, I found this to be charming, funny, and engaging. Holly Hunter is a gift, and she and William Hurt have legit chemistry that had me twirling my fan like a Southern belle. Albert Brooks is pretty funny and perfect as the nerd who feels entitled to other people's attention

A tremendous movie, and a huge influence on things I love, so it's hard not to love it back

Dressed in rags, Rosalie drags the body of a senior man to the hole, throwing in a gun and a bag of gold pieces. She sings a song to the rising sun

Roslie hitches across New Mexico, getting a ride from traveling salesman Virgil (Ken Howard, AKA Hank Hooper from 30 Rock) to her grandfather's ranch

When they arrive, however, it isn't a ranch but a cabin in the middle of nowhere, and Grandpa is missing. Worse still, Virgil's car pops a flat while stuck in the mud. Then, when he least expects it, Rosalie breaks his leg

Rosalie is a girl with no education, living in backwaters where no one can find her, which means no one sees her. So, in her capture of Virgil, she begins a strange courtship in which she promises to care for him and make him fall in love with her if only he'd give her the chance

Virgil, on the other hand, cannot hide his contempt for Rosalie, throwing insults at her that I don't feel comfortable writing out — though he tries to mix his venom with niceties, Rosalie sees through his words

Though compared to Misery, the two stories feel pretty different. I will say that Misery's story has enough variety to keep it from getting monotonous — here, we have the same conversations over and over until circumstances change — logical and realistic, but not all that entertaining

With Colby smolders swallowed up by the Marvel machine, it's so pleasant to see her in something where she gets to act — she is inconsistent, but it's the writing more than her

Kevin Corrigan is such a specific and weird person in this, and he has most of the laughs because he finds the line between animated and caricature

Guy Pierce is good in this, but I think he's the weakest part — he gets some good moments, but he doesn't receive the direction needed to figure out his character beyond the surface, ""He’s a fitness-obsessed guy who doesn't know how to communicate what he means.""

The movie takes a different direction about 3/4 through that shifts everyone's performances into romcom territory — not a bad thing, but it feels globbed on, if only because it suddenly becomes more structured and motivated until the end

I'm overrating this, but it's charming and easy-going enough, even if it doesn't have a clear understanding of what it wants to be

When William (Jack Watson) sees the headline wedding announcement, he jumps on a train to London and systematically harasses Samantha

Through a therapy session, we learn that William was the lover of Samantha's mother and the man who killed her mother — a murder she witnessed. Soon after the confession, the therapist is brutally murdered — the first of a series of shockingly violent sequences

The waxwork is quite lifelike, and each scene is from a different horror movie genre — werewolves, vampires, mummies, uh... Marquis De Sade? Tony finds an exhibit with a chair and tries to step over the cord, but when he does, it transports him to a real-life version of the scene, which traps him

China, too, falls into one of the scenes, and Mark and Sarah can't find them. They try to go to the police, who say several other people are missing, but they won't help the kids. It's up to Sarah and Mark to figure out what the waxwork is up to and how to stop it

The movie has a goofy, almost made-for-TV vibe until the gore starts flying, and it's surprisingly graphic — the first kill we see is a guy being ripped in half. It's pretty fun in places, but by the time it needs to resolve the plot, it starts to feel rushed and shabby

What I'm more interested in is how the movie portrays women who want sex. China is someone who hooks up with anyone she wants. At one point, it's Mark, but by the next day, it's someone else. In some ways, she is chasing danger to mix up her dull life

— I do what I want when I want. Dig it or fuck off

In typical horror fashion, China's desire for danger is, ultimately, what kills her as she succumbs to Dracula

Sarah, though, is a horror movie oddity. First off, while having a little crush on Mark, when the moment comes that she can go out with him, she decides she wants something different (see spoilers for more)

The child Satan grows into a queer-coded teenager whom the ruffians bully for his effeminate mannerisms and appearance. So it turns into <i>Carrie</i> but with mean boys — complete with a shower scene and a concentrated dose of dong

Eventually, Satan rises in power, drinking dog and chicken blood to gain strength — the scenes with the angels organizing and finding each other were confusing, so I won't try to summarize that.

But when Ami kicks her out so that Ami's girlfriend can move in, Eevi's sense of abandonment and rage manifests in stealing Ami's car and taking a road trip

Though Eevi constantly seeks connection, she cannot tolerate it when it doesn't happen how she wants it. What begins as a curiosity around violence and sadism evolves into kidnapping and murder

The film unfolds unusually, not explicitly stating why we're following Eevi or what we should learn from her. But as the story unfolds, like cards mid-shuffle, everything falls into place, and the portrait makes (enough) sense

The cinematography does an impressive job unveiling new information and framing moments. Also, the final sequence is so beautiful and freaky

The world painted in this movie is full of dismissive cruelty — we see so few people that it's hard to tell what is supposed to be ""normal"" behavior. I think it's intentional, letting the audience know that it's not what Eevi feels that is the problem but how those feelings manifest

This is a striking and intense debut film from Auli Mantila — I'm looking forward to checking out <i>Geography of Fear</i> (if I can track down a copy)

They are with me still — real in memory as they were in flesh, loving and beloved forever. How green was my valley then</i></blockquote>The film is an episodic reflection by Huw Morgan on his childhood in a coal-mining village in Wales during the 1920s. The mine owner reduces wages, driving the union mine workers to strike, dividing his family into those who support it and those who don't. The film details the lessons and tragedies that followed before Huw lost his father

<blockquote><i>We are not questioning your authority, sir. But if manners prevent our speaking the truth, we will be without manners</i></blockquote>The film explores several issues within the context of Christianity, with Mr. Gruffydd — the village chapel's pastor — being the moderate voice that finds a way to rectify both — the reliance on nature, the fear of unions, and others

<blockquote><i>Nature is the handmaiden to the Lord</i></blockquote>Like any good Lefty movie, the film fetishizes labor, showing the Morgans as men who are more than happy to give their work but for a fair wage. When the son of the coal mine's owner pursues and marries Huw's sister, Angharad, we see how her estrangement from family and the rich lifestyle in which people cater to needs makes her physically ill

<blockquote><i>Some learned that there would never be work for them again in their valley</i></blockquote>The cinematography is some of the most beautiful I've seen from American films in the 40s. The impressive 80-acre set and the numerous extras help it feel like an actual village (they wanted to film it in Technicolor in Wales but couldn't due to WWII)

<blockquote><i>I was taught man is made in the image of God, not sheep</i></blockquote>The film's structure made it difficult to sustain interest in places, but it never took me out of the movie. Similarly, the film had a couple of saccharine, sentimental moments that felt at odds with the more realistic tone of the rest of the movie, but nothing offensive — it is, after all, Oscar bait

Overall, this is a striking and monumental achievement in American cinema that deserves more contemporary attention, especially in light of the current SAG-AFTRA strike

Too powerful to be destroyed, too intelligent to be captured, this being still pursues its savage dream</i></blockquote>Alex Holland (Ray Wise) is a scientist working on a top-secret formula that will allow plants to grow in inhospitable places. After a group of paramilitaries — led by Anton Arcane (Louis Jourdan), intent on hijacking the project for their nefarious plans  — kill one of his researchers, Alice Cable (Adrienne Barbeau) takes the researcher's place in the bog lab

I'm watching this movie because:
1. Adrienne Barbeau
2. Ray Wise
3. Wes Craven's daughter hated how passive the final girl is in this, which motivated him to make a more complex and decisive lead for <i>A Nightmare on Em Street</i>

Once one of the researchers pulled off his face Mission Impossible-style, I felt like this would be up my alley. The film leans into the rubber suit, <i>Creature from the Black Lagoon </i>qualities

Unfortunately, once (spoiler alert) Alex turns into the Swamp Thing, the movie becomes a long set of repetitive set pieces. The heavy action is intentional — Wes Craven wanted to prove to Hollywood that he can handle action and stunts

The third act redeems the movie with its Bond villain speeches and gross-out effects and transformations — without this, I wouldn't have enjoyed this as much

I'll be interested to see how DC handles the inherently campy nature of this story in their remake — lots of potential to make similar mistakes made in the Hulk movies

Overall, I like the setup more than the payoff, but there's some fun cheese in the mix

The two facets that make this worth watching:
1. The outrageous special effects
2. The homoeroticism 

This movie goes hard on the special effects from the get-go — it opens with a dream sequence in which Freddy drives a bus over the precipice of hell — later, Freddy rips off the top of his head to show his brain — so many objects and creatures catch fire and explode — Freddy crawls out of Jesse's chest, which may be an all-timer for me

The homoerotic undertones are subtle at first but ramp up, starting with running into his gym teacher in a leather bar, then watching Freddy tie him up and spank him before ""running him through."" When he and Lisa have the opportunity to hook up, he runs to his friend's to be kept safe
<blockquote><i>He's inside of me, and he wants to take me again... he owns me</i></blockquote>Freddy represents (sometimes, kind of) his desire to come out, manifesting with Freddy crawling out of him and culminating in the confusing ending that I won't spoil or attempt to explain

I think the movie's greatest success is how fun it all is. While the first one is more imaginative and coherent, this one is willing to abandon all logic for a set piece. If it were anywhere in between, this would be a much worse movie

</i><i>How I loathe them.
</i><i>— Edgar Allan Poe</i></blockquote>Kristen has those awful nightmares starring everyone's favorite pedophilic murderer, Freddy Krueger. When she wakes up, she cuts her wrist, so her parents admit her to a psychiatric hospital

She learns that she is one of several kids who are sleep deprived, doing everything possible not to sleep and see you-know-who. It just so happens that Nancy from movie 1 works there as an intern, so we get to know all the kids in the ward from her introductions

We learn that Kristen has the gift of pulling people into her dreams, and she pulls Nancy in to help her escape. Little does she know how valuable this power will be, especially once others discover their abilities in the dream world

Straight away, the atmosphere is so much creepier than in 2, but Craven has never been able to avoid a little goofiness here and there. Still, this feels human and cohesive in a way that I can forgive some slower moments

It does not let up on the bizarro kills and effects, though:

* The roasted pig coming alive
* Slimy worm Kreuger swallowing Kristin
* The TV set comes alive
* the souls of children embedded in Kreuger's body like sores
*<i> Jason and the Argonauts</i>-style skeletons

The chemistry between Patricia Arquette and Heather Langenkamp feels special — Nancy is such an inspiring character who found the ability to escape Freddy and live her life but gives that up to help these kids. Kristen is sensitive and frightened, but through Nancy, she finds the strength to be who she sees herself as

Still, Joe manages to pull him in. But no sooner than he begins, the police are on every trail, and Tucker smells a rat in the organization. In the end, Joe has to decide what he values more: the money or his family

Noir is where the shady people talk quietly and calmly, and the honest folk yell and don't get heard. The script is like an undergrad is translating a film noir — the banter is there, but it's obtuse and overbearing

Joe Morse never says a word that doesn't intend manipulation — Jordan Belfort in <i>The Wolf of Wall Street</i> follows a similar MO

At a wedding reception, Catherine cannot seem to find a man who is willing to dance with her — her loving Aunt Lavinia (Miriam Hopkins) coerces a boy to dance with Catherine, but he quickly sits her down, pretends to get drinks, and abandons her to dance with someone else

Later that night, the charming and undeniably handsome Morris Townsend (Montgomery Clift) sits with Catherine and offers to dance with her. The two hit it off, and within a few days, the two intend to marry one another

But Morris does not ask Catherine's father's permission — he knows that Dr. Sloper will not approve because Morris is poor — instead, he bolsters her to stand up to him and insist they be married

This act convinces Dr. Sloper that Morris is only after Catherine's inheritance and does not love her. Aunt Lavinia, on the other hand, gets swept away by the romance of it all and encourages Catherine like she's in a romance

The film is an extended metaphor for Korean identity in a post-colonialist, globalized world. The construction sites where the virus is are sites for future malls and fast-food places. As American products and media make their way over to Korea, many Koreans choose to adopt a more American way of life — perhaps forgetting their ancestral and cultural history (at least, according to the director)

Cary Grant gets the most laughs out of his pratfalls and handsome, demeaning smirks — his performance is only diminished by playing against Irene Dunne. Also, this is the film that established the ""Cary Grant"" persona that every director would ask for afterward

After receiving the position, Linh befriends the cook, who tells her she has made a mistake coming — that this estate has a history of hundreds of servants dying (predominantly Vietnamese), their bodies buried in unmarked graves beneath the rubber trees

The cook also tells a story about the former mistress of the house, who drowned her baby in the tub and, out of guilt, walked to the lake and drowned herself

Captain Laurent, the master of the house, returns from war with a bullet wound — the house assigns Linh to help him recover. As she does, the two fall for each other and begin a secret affair — secret to the house and Laurent's fiancée Madeleine

It is then that the ghost of the mistress returns to exact her revenge

The house itself is gothic and full of shadows, especially when Linh walks the halls at night by oil lamp

The music and sound are over-the-top, never letting a single moment go unscored or pushing jump scare sounds even if you don't see anything 

Taking place near the end of the First Indochinese War, the film encouraged me to read more about French Indochina and how the Geneva Agreements that granted sovereignty to Vietnam from France also led to the Vietnam War

The historical horror seems to be heavily influenced by Guillermo Del Toro, especially <i>The Devil's Backbone</i>

The film itself functions as a (not so subtle) metaphor for the French occupation and the turn that the war was taking at the time

Joshua's got this kid and Allison Janey is looking for him. He supposed to kill the kid, but he wants the kid to help him find his wife, so I guess that's what the movie about

It's beautifully shot, and does great job of establishing place by giving us a lot of incidental footage of humans and AI coexisting in spaces. Sometimes they're just like hanging out at a bar, driving a car, listening to music or one scene where an AI is telling about a future of peace, and a great thing that is going to come and save them all

<blockquote><i>Do you know that your will can actually change the outcome of events?</i></blockquote>

Six years ago, Li and some friends who hunted ghosts filmed a ritual that they were not supposed to — the village worshipping an esoteric Yunnan deity named Mother Buddha

The film tells the story non-linearly, switching between six years ago and the present, where Li deals with her daughter Dodo’s erratic behavior — behavior reminiscent of the rituals and events that Li experienced six years ago

The film also includes participatory elements, specifically around the following incantation: HOU-HO-XIU-YI, SI-SEI-WU-MA. It also urges the audience to believe in the ability of the mind to control the direction or outcome of your life

The scares themselves are fine — we’ve seen variations on these for years now, so it’s hard to do anything surprising. For the complexity of the story structure, I don’t know if found footage works throughout, especially when it jumps between times without significant indicators

The facet of the film I found most compelling was the folk rituals — I know the religious community in the film is fiction, but I still find it fascinating to see how these practices  and their surrounding altars/temples play out

2023-09-30,Bad Dreams,1988,https://boxd.it/4UPirR,2.5,,"In the 1970s, Harris (Richard Lynch) brings Cynthia (Colbie Smulders prototype Jennifer Rubin) into his cult along with over 20 others to partake in a mass suicide — ""the final break with the old world.” He douses everyone, one by one, in gasoline and lights a fire, causing the whole house to explode. When the fire department arrives, they find one survivor: Cynthia. They rush her to the hospital, where she remains in a coma for 13 years

When she awakens, it’s the 80s, baby, and she doesn’t remember what happened to her. Her psychiatrist, Dr. Karmen (Bruce Abbott of <i>Re-Animator</i> fame), suggests she join a borderline personality support group — not necessarily for the diagnosis, but for her repressed memories with the intent of accessing them and knowing what went down the day of the fire

While in recovery, she begins to see visions of Harris (sometimes as he was and other times charred from the fire) of the day of the fire — he beckons her to fulfill her promise and join them. When she refuses, it seems that he starts taking the other members of the BPD support group

No surprise, the representation of BPD in this movie is inaccurate at best — at worst, grossly misrepresented for the sake of having a room of “kookie characters.” Jennifer Rubin plays her tortured role well and should count among the scream queens for the harsh wails she emits here. In her support group is Lana, played by 80s indie darling and prolific voice actor E.G. Daily, whom I think gives an empathetic performance compared to her castmates

The special effects are hit or miss — the fire stunts are well-executed, and some of the smaller, “stabbier” scenes are convincing. Richard Lynch’s post-fire makeup is probably the weakest — sort of ironic (is it?), considering Richard Lynch lit himself on fire while on LSD in the 70s

They go to Jane's college graduation — Tun, a professional photographer, goes to take a photo of the senior class and sees a pale woman in the viewfinder, but when he pulls down the camera, she isn't there

When he gets the photos developed, he notices white smears in the prints and the negatives — shapes he didn't see when taking the photos. Also, Jane begins to have nightmares in which a <i>Ringu</i>-like figure emerges and stalks her

That girl stays at a friend's place, trying to explain what happened to her, but someone stabs and hangs her, it's arms monstrous with filth

When Suzy finally arrives at the school, she meets the unhinged personalities who run and occupy the school. While initially offered an apartment off-campus, one of the school matrons found a place for her in the school. She declines but then passes out during class, and the matrons settle her in the room at the school

This movie is so goddamn beautiful — no one makes every frame feel neon like Argento. Inspired by the colors of Disney's <i>Snow White</i>, they gave the film the same hyperreal technicolor process used for <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>, which pushes the reds to the extremes

But the room is not available, although 2047 is. At first, Mo-Wan is reluctant, but he agrees to take it. As a result, he can only overhear or catch a glimpse of that space

Over the years, he meets the women who move into 2046, forming relationships with them but finding himself incapable of letting them mean anything. In his story analog, they are pleasure androids with whom the customer is forbidden to fall in love

The film is full of beautiful cinematography, costumes, and makeup — similar to In the Mood for Love, the soundtrack revolves around one succinct theme

I haven't seen <i>Days of Being Wild,</i> the first part of the loose trilogy alongside<i> In the Mood for Love</i> and this, but I can say that<i> In the Mood for Love</i> exists on its own without any stray pieces

While this has a few transcendent moments, it still feels more like an epilogue or partner film rather than something that can exist on its own — several moments are mirrors of the prior film

Also, the sci-fi aspect is underdeveloped and underutilized — thematically, that makes sense, but as a viewer, it is frustrating to move away from the arresting images of his story to the shadowy ephemera of his life

Still, there is a lot to love in this — as in other Wong Kar-wai films, I can honestly say that this movie has images that I haven't seen in anything else — I just felt like I was getting a puzzle piece instead of a whole picture","criterion channel, ai, criterion",2023-09-30

Jake and Kyra, their parents, purchased Yang to help Mike better connect with her Chinese heritage

At the start, we find Jake disconnected — working in a tea shop that he loves but gets few customers — reliant on Yang to be a surrogate parent for both him and Kyra

One morning, they wake up to find Yang has turned off and cannot turn back on. Jake promises to get him fixed, while Kyra wonders if they should start helping Mika transition to a life without Yang (and secretly hoping that they can also reconnect as a family)

While seeking a way to fix Yang, Jake obtains something initially thought impossible: a memory bank for Yang. In the process of reviewing the memories, Jake gets the opportunity to see Yang in ways he didn't think possible

What if you could access someone else's memories? What we might find is how our memories connect to theirs, what we valued and noticed in the shared moments, and perhaps what we missed

The movie has such beautiful set design and costumes and a wonderfully soothing score. There's also a recurring Mitski song that grows more meaningful every time it occurs

Joon-woo is a gamer whose online session stops when an emergency alert says that civilians are acting aggressively, displaying cannibalistic tendencies. Looking outside, he sees uproar as some people chase others, violently attacking them

The news on TV suggests things aren't so bad, showing efforts to rid the streets of zombies and providing breathing exercises to help tolerate the quarantine. But from his apartment, Joon-woo must watch on helplessly as people below die and join the zombie mob

After several close calls and a diminished food supply, he tries to hang himself, but a laser pointer hits his face, giving him hope that someone else might still be alive

The film, having come out in late 2020, is a not-too-clever metaphor for the COVID quarantine. But it also functions as a way of looking at the isolation bred from city life — even if there are other survivors, how could he find them without a lucky break?

And that leads to the film's biggest flaw. Yes, Joon-woo is the lead, so we expect that the reason we see his story and not someone else's is because of the fortune that allows him to survive at all. However, with how many run-ins he has with the zombies, the choreography for those scenes border on non-existent as we see zombies pile on him and him still finding a way to weasel out

The makeup and effects for the zombies are pretty good — it looks like <i>Train to Busan</i> was an inspiration for the filmmakers

The movie also has some pleasant character moments — nothing brilliant, but letting the circumstances present opportunities to get to know our lead adds a layer of investment in not only if he survives but how

The score in the film is by the band Rheingold, whose lead singer plays R in the movie. The music is fine, but it makes sense why the band came and went in 4 years

The cinematography is what takes this movie from the exploitation realm to something more arthouse — what it shows and what it doesn't is a significant part of the intent

R uses a cutesy SS logo, and some of the band's artwork has crowds of saluting Nazi youth — throughout the movie are pieces of National Socialism. I watched an interview with the director to get a better understanding of his intent. <b>The quote contains minor spoilers:</b>

The entire doc feels like an ad for the doc — every scene gets 3-5 seconds before moving on or intercutting it with a thematically similar image. Doing that for 104 minutes is exhausting.

Any time they let someone speak, it’s often inane platitudes that people repeat to themselves or put on kitchen decorations. Or they’ll use footage from a speech or Ted Talk — like, did no one say anything interesting on Earth that day?

It’s odd how much footage of North Korea they use, considering it’s footage from the same tour they give all outsiders. And being American filmmakers, they use so much footage from the United States, which is so boring

Endless court marshals deaden the spirit of the people.

""I came to ask if you'd give me a baby,"" she says through embarrassed tears. He asks her to move in and be his maid and changes her name to Wendy. As she dreams of their future, he stabs Tinker to death with a box cutter

They tell stories together, each bringing their weirdness but somehow getting along

Coming at the tail end of Hammer's ""mini-Hitchcock"" series, the film has weird vibes throughout. The editing is manic and disjointed, cutting sharply between scenes. No one seems to act like a human — they're all so rude!

Peter has mommy issues and issues with beauty because he believes everyone who ever loved him did so for his beauty

Brenda is so insecure that she doesn't believe she deserves a loving, reciprocal relationship. She puts up with dismissive behavior from everyone around her, desperate for someone to give her the child she wants

Mahmoud visits Sheikh Dragore to take back the Eternal Light. Dragore has sold it to Professor Morlant, a renowned Egyptologist (see “imperialist thief”), who is dying and believes that the Eternal Light will grant him eternal life. Morlant summons Laing, his servant,  to ensure his funeral follows the proper procedure so that Annubis will help him come back at the next full moon

Of course, everyone wants the Eternal Light for themselves, and his heirs want anything at all, so the hoard goes to his Egyptian-themed home and learns his secrets

Wouldn’t you know it? Dragore comes back to life and starts killing them one by one

The remastering on this looks so lovely — they preserved the film's high contrast and soft textures. The house set looks cool too

Bolsheviks come to Paris to sell jewels to help fund the impoverished mother country. Within moments, they talk about how great France is — they're afraid of the judgment they'll receive for indulging in any luxury, but still take the Royal Suite at their hotel

Grand Duchess Swana (Ina Claire) gets word from a spy that the Bolsheviks have her lost jewels — confiscated by the Russian state — and intend to sell them. Count Leon d'Algout  (Melvyn Douglas) intercepts the sale, to the embarrassment of the Bolsheviks

To aid their suit, Russia sends their comrade Ninotchka (Greta Garbo), who more strongly upholds the ""luxury is evil"" party line

The Count and Ninotchka run into each other at a traffic crossing, and the Count offers her help navigating the city. The Count gets off insulting her and so follows her around and flirts

Though Ninotchka is uninterested, the Count is relentless and succeeds in wooing her. As the two fall for each other, they take on each other's values — Nitochka comes to love, I don't know, the sun? and the Count reads Capital and cares for the working man

Garbo's performance is fantastic as she moves from stone-faced party member to bourgeois lovesick woman — she carries the entire film, giving the material a sincerity that injects character into what is on paper a caricature. Her accent sucks, though — more Zsa Zsa Gabor than Russian diplomat

Douglas does fine as ""intellectually and fiscally superior man,"" but you could put just about anyone in Hollywood in his shoes and get the same result

The Bolshevik men have the most overt comedic touch, playing something like the Marx Brothers (get it?)

There are so many tiny pieces of this that I love, but the movie as a whole is a mixed bag. It's a landmark for Greta Garbo's step into comedy and worth seeing for that reason alone

I like it! I just wanted to like it more because it theoretically has everything needed for something spectacular

* Garbo plays Champagne Drunk at one point, and it's delightful

According to the newspapers, Dr. Brewster (Bela Lugosi) has vanished, but his colleague, Dr. Randall, knows the truth. He takes the doctor’s sister, Agatha, out to a lab where Dr. Brewser and Dr. Randall had performed a series of scientific experiments. For one, Dr. Brewster offered himself up as the guinea pig, but the experiment went awry, and he became THE APE MAN

The only treatment they know of is to inject Brewster with human spinal fluid — an extraction process that guarantees death. Randall will not kill in the name of science, but Brewster will

To test it out, he kills Randall’s butler. The results see his posture return upright, but he needs much more to reverse the process, so he must kill that much more

Meanwhile, photographer Billie Mason and reporter Jeff Carter are, coincidentally, trying to do a story on Agatha Brewster, a ghost hunter. And wouldn’t you know it? They stumble into this Ape Man mess, and they become in danger of becoming spinal fluid donors

The movie doesn’t quite land in the campy fun territory — lots of wasted time threading plot points and trying to maintain some tension throughout the film. There are some funny moments throughout — every time he tried to assert dominance over the other ape I laughed — but it's not enough to suggest watching

There’s a tone to the movie that suggests it may be trying to be funny or satirical of the genre in some way, but that only comes through when the author shows up at the end, looks at the camera, and says, “Screwy idea, wasn’t it?” like Bugs Bunny

Overall, it's a silly little thing only for genre enthusiasts

2023-10-07,The Glass Ceiling,1971,https://boxd.it/4X8Gsv,3,,"Martha is a bored housewife. Her husband, Michael, goes out of town all the time. In her loneliness and boredom, she tries to be sociable, but they misunderstand her intentions — a delivery boy invited up for wine makes an advance that she turns down

Martha regularly listens to the footsteps of her upstairs neighbors, Victor and Julie. On one insomnia-laden night, she hears a loud thud and footsteps that leave her wondering what has happened. As she makes her regular visits to folks in the apartment, she notices Victor’s absence and comes to the only logical conclusion: that Julie and a lover have murdered Victor

Her only actual friend in the apartment is her landlord Richard, who is also a nude model sculptor (gotta get those Giallo boobs into the movie somehow!). She confides in him her suspicions — his dogs aren’t eating, and he keeps smelling decomposing flesh — but he accuses her of being a voyeur. Their relationship dynamic leads to a kiss that leaves Martha feeling guilty and her head full of nightmarish possibilities

The film has moments of energy and captivating filmmaking, but they’re so sparse as we spend such a long time with Martha’s suspicions and her inability to act on them. The film has a side plot with Richard sculpting some teen girl, but it doesn’t go anywhere

It isn’t until the final few minutes that the plot progresses forward in an explosion of exposition and physicality (vague enough to avoid spoilers?), but it’s hard to make up for the previous 80-odd minutes

At home, his fiancée, Hee-eun, has bought a table for their future family — a lit stage where they can talk out their feelings

The next day, the news announces the discovery of a dead 5-year-old and 6-year-old on the train. Later that night, he sees their bodies sitting at the new table

Jung-won encounters Yun, a woman with narcolepsy he gives a ride to, and she passes out in his car. When she wakes up, she mentions the kids at the table — she can see them too

The story shifts to Yun, focusing on an infanticide trial with her friend Jung-sook. Yun witnessed Jung-sook intentionally drop her baby from the railings of her high-rise apartment. But her testimony is called into question as it involves Yun having the power to show Jung-sook a repressed childhood memory — a memory that she believes contributed to the murder

As Yun and Jung-won get to know each other, it jeopardizes his future with his fiancée. But he believes in Yun's abilities and asks her to do the same for him, putting together puzzle pieces he knew about and several he had forgotten, and his life is irreparably changed

The Uninvited are the memories we refuse to acknowledge, the painful truth that makes life unbearable, the ghosts of our regrets — our minds protect us from these memories when they're intense enough, but her power unearths them whether they can handle it or not

The violence in this is brutal — it does not shy away from showing you people hitting pavement or trucks crushing babies

The plotting is a little complicated, and I felt lost a couple of times — I condensed the events of the movie for the above summary — but it all came around by the end

Don and Alice have holed up in their house with a few other folks — their kids went on a trip before the outbreak and are safe. To save a little boy, they accidentally bring a hoard of zombies in — Don must choose between saving his wife or himself — he makes it out alone

28 weeks after the breakout, the American military interceded, creating a green zone for the start of reconstruction — no signs of the virus

Don's kids are back in London. Wanting to retrieve a picture of their mother (who they believe to be deceased), they cross the border into the red zone and go to their house. Sergent Doyle (Jeremy Renner) spots them crossing and alerts others for retrieval

In the house, Andy finds his mother still alive, but something is different about her. The military comes in close behind to rescue them. They examine the mother, who is infected but not showing symptoms. The mother is a natural carrier who could be the key to a vaccine or cure — a trait she could have passed down to the kids

Don, a full-blown moron we're supposed to hate, I guess, sneaks away to see Alice, kisses her, and turns into a zombie, brutally murdering her and then rampaging — the virus is back, and it's up to Doyle, Scarlet, and helicopter pilot Flynn (Harold Perrineau!) to get Tammy and Andy out of danger

As an action movie, this is better-paced and has better setpieces. But as a zombie flick, it doesn't do much of interest with the material explored in the first movie

Seems like the ending was to set up a sequel. I know Danny Boyle has talked about doing<i> 28 Years Later</i>, but he's been consistently disappointing for a while now, so hopefully he would let someone else do it

Overall, this is a solid, intense action flick and better than I anticipated

George (James Brolin) is initially kind to everyone but grows cold and irritable. Stuff keeps going wrong at the house, and every religious person who tries to visit gets sick

That said, the film is a digest of horror cliches — jump scares and fake-outs out of the wazoo, house wind, creepy kids talking to ""imaginary friends,"" cats with bad vibes, irrationally angry fathers who chop too much wood, crosses being flipped over, learning secrets through microfiche, being supposedly based on a true story

The film plays like a mixtape of influences — more freak show comedy than a horror film for most of its runtime, and desperate for the audience to know how much the filmmaker knows about horror and shlock — you're either into it or over it before the title card

She encounters two pilots, Joe and Les, who offer her a drink, bringing her to their local hang, Dutchy's Bar. There, Bonnie meets Han Solo prototype Geoff Carter (Cary Grant), the boss of their air mail delivery service

Geoff sends Joe on a dangerous delivery in deep fog. When the weather turns, they try to route Joe back to the airway. But the plane crashes, and he dies. Bonnie is dismayed to see how unsympathetic the other men are — the men scavenge what personal items of Joe they can recover and divvy them up between each other

Bonnie learns that the mail delivery business is failing and that Geoff doesn't know what to do. Geoff goes on a flight, expecting Bonnie to have boarded her ship and left, but when he returns, she is there, waiting a week for the next boat so that she can spend time with Geoff

Things get heated when Geoff hires Bat MacPherson, a man known for his cowardice who abandoned a crashing plane with another pilot still in it. If that isn't enough, Bat's wife Judy (Rita Hayworth) is an old fling of Geoff's and perhaps the heartbreaker that turned him into the stone man we see

The film follows the pilot crew as they try to make their deliveries and possibly save the company. The movie has a hangout vibe — so much of it takes place at Dutchy's, watching character dynamics play out. The men are comrades who like each other, are good at their job, and they suffer the crap pay to participate in this group

Pilots delivering mail used to call themselves the Suicide Club because of how dangerous it was and how often people died doing it — ex-WWI pilots looking for work, like Geoff

The miniature work is terrific for 1939 — they built incredible sets and crashed so many model planes to get the crashes they show in the movie — they used bicycle rigs to pilot the miniatures so that they turned and glided more realistically

And they do have actual flights as well — the cinematographer had a special camera that could dynamically move and still allow him to fly his plane

The movie doesn't use non-diegetic music  — the airplanes starting, taking off, and radio communication make up the sound field

I read an interview with the filmmaker in which he talks about the violent stories in his films as fairy tales

<blockquote><i>Fairy tales [...] contain a great deal of violence and cruelty, like the desires that pass through us. They contain and reveal that founding, archaic, and animal part of us that is eventually tamed by society</i></blockquote>

The film steps into the extremes of eros and thanatos — the serial killer that chokes the life out of prostitutes during sex. It is the one who doesn’t fully know the pleasure of sex — whose first time and its pain are unknown experiences — that willfully goes into the hands of death to see what emerges. Part of the killer’s drive comes from the struggle for life — without it, his meaning evaporates

The film plays with the concept of the gaze by pulling you so intimately into the space of the characters that you have total distance from them — their world is overflowing with terrifying feelings and desires. But the way we look informs how we receive and respond to them. The sex people have — the noises and gestures they make — it becomes difficult to differentiate between those of pleasure and those of pain 

Like the soundtrack by Suicide’s Alan Vega, we get long moments of atmosphere. It’s difficult to tell what, if anything, is happening. The camera cannot see in the darkest rooms — it won’t look up to the helicopters or the passing bikers, nor will it zoom out and focus on what it sees. Most moments are almost mundane in that the camera barely looks at what is happening

I don’t think the movie succeeds at its goals, but the filmmaking itself is compelling. Coming from the art world, Grandrieux has an unusual eye, and it’s the boundaries he pushes there that I find more valuable than the moral transgressions he explores","vk, house of psychotic women, 1001 movies",2023-10-09

In Iran, Scarlett Marlowe, an architect and Ph.D. student, breaks a seal to uncover the Rose Key. She narrowly escapes with footage of all the engravings.

The Rose Key translates alchemy formulas into Aramaic, guiding you to the Philosopher’s Stone. The Philosopher's Stone is an alchemical tool that can turn rock into gold and possibly grant eternal life. 

George, an old friend of Scarlett, knows Aramaic. With his help, they translate the clues. The evidence points to the Paris catacombs as the elusive hiding place of the philosopher’s stone.

George knows a guy who knows a guy that can get them into the forbidden area of the catacombs. They have a trillion opportunities to turn back, but Scarlett won’t stop. They go onward and downward.

Michaela (Sandra Hüller) is a religious 21-year-old woman who has spent the past few years in the hospital because of epilepsy. After six months without an incident, her father supported her desire to go to college and get her teaching degree. Her mother, however, doesn't believe she can handle it

At school, Michaela makes a friend, Hanna (Anna Blomeier), and meets a boy at a party. She also starts to have epileptic episodes again. At first, Hanna and her father help cover for her. Hanna encourages her to see a doctor and get help

Initially, Michaela follows through with the doctor's visit, but the experience reminds her of the years in the hospital that seemed to have done nothing. She stops believing that they are epileptic seizures and believes that demons are tormenting her. Her priest tries to sway her to medicine, but the church vicar believes her and tells her she is suffering like Saint Katherine, who resisted the devil and found redemption in death

Dr. Jekyll dedicates his life to helping others — everyone sees the good in him except his fiancee’s father, who only sees his social indecencies.

Jekyll treats a bar singer, Ivy, and she tries to seduce him. His colleague, Dr. Lanyon, steps in. Jekyll laments the impulses he cannot control, hinting at the ability to separate good and evil desires.

In his lab, Jekyll misses sleep and dinner engagements to develop a drug to release his evil impulses. While looking into the mirror, he takes the elixir and watches it change his appearance, giving him an ape-like appearance. He names his new persona Hyde.

Hyde tracks down the woman who tried to seduce Dr. Jekyll. He offers to support her financially to have her company. Rather than help her, he locks her away in her boarding house, raping and torturing her.

When he finally becomes Jekyll again, his guilt overcomes him, and he swears never to become Hyde again. Little does he know he may not have control over it.

This film is a technical marvel. It uses first-person to highlight the contrasts between how the world sees Jekyll and Hyde. The transformation scenes use color filters to make makeup changes appear in real-time.

They do a good job at the vampire deaths, and it’s very satisfying to watch the evil folks squirm. But Danny and Abra are too strong together, so the stakes don’t feel high.

The reason <i>The Shining</i> movie works is that it throws away the parts of the book that try to over-explain everything.

Franz Biberkopf served four years in prison for murdering his girlfriend. Now, he is in a loud city where he feels he doesn't belong. He will try and give an honest go at it for once in his life.

The story unfolds from there but also unwinds, slackening at the edges — what would be a single scene in a movie or show becomes an entire episode of soliloquy and discursion, a disassociating narrator who feels like he's watching a different part of the show

In this restored version — the original was a dark garbled mess that pissed off German audiences — the lighting and coloring read like historical melodrama. And it is that, but it also isn't that? All I can say is that Fassbinder manages to fuck with the story and still tell the story

The cinematography often lives in extended single takes that are only ""cut"" by the camera moving to another position — perfect for the stage play-like speeches that play throughout the show.

Our hero rapes, beats and bloodies, lies, cheats, sells Nazi propaganda, kills animals, laughs at a man killing his wife and three kids, and worst of all, rejects Communism (Joking!)

The endless drunken evenings, lovers coming and going, friends who instantly turn to adversaries — no lasting relief, just life, and its casual punishments.

But it has an impact — the cruelty that Franz gives and receives breaks my heart.

About halfway through the show, it actually becomes a crime story — Franz gives up the honest pursuit and takes the work that will make him money to live, but the cost is higher than he could imagine.

Franz is archetypal and totally foreign to me — somewhere between Ignatius J. Reilly and Tony Soprano, with a dash of Job from the Christian bible — a child who only thinks the honest are fooling him.

Franz's relationship with Reinhold is a love I can only compare to Hannibal and Will Graham in the <i>Hannibal</i> TV show: it is selfish, demands its own way, and lingers in suffering.
<blockquote><i>Love Has Its Price</i></blockquote>The epilogue is probably what most people remember. It contains two extended fantasy sequences that seem to exist in Franz's mind. It's a film that requires the entire story up to this point to mean anything and contains some of the most memorable imagery of the show.

The pacing in this show makes <i>Twin Peaks: The Return</i> look taut. Both exercise patience and expectation, but from almost opposite angles — <i>Twin Peaks </i>creates a surrealist hyperreality, while this creates a hyperreal banality.

Also, both are boring until they aren't. Or maybe both of them fucked with my perception of time. It's one of those experiences where the series teaches you how to watch it.

A genuinely singular experience

<blockquote><i>There is a reaper whose name is Death. And he arrives on hatchets and knives, blowing a little flute. Then he opens wide his jaws, and he takes out his trumpet.

His lawyer and best friend, David (Sean Penn), helped him get out on technicalities and doesn't believe Carlito can change.

After a small favor for some capital turns nasty, Carlito uses the earnings to buy a share of El Paradiso so he can make enough honest money to retire for good.

David's getting into trouble, doing an 80s-worth of coke, and stealing millions from clients in prison. So now he has to bust a guy out of Rikers, and he's guilted Carlito into helping him.

If I had seen this before Mission to Mars, I might have called this a lesser De Palma. By lesser, I don't mean bad, though. This movie is good, even though it made a few unfortunate choices (mostly the casting for this Puerto Rican gangster story). It's just sitting next to some of the best movies I've seen in De Palma's filmography.

The movie has stellar music choices — some of my favorite disco/dance numbers.

Two paramedics, Steve (Anthony Mackie) and Dennis (Jamie Dornan) keep arriving at bizarre deaths — stab wounds but no blade, burn victims but no fire. At each scene, they find a drug called Synchronic.

When Dennis's daughter, Brianna, disappears after taking Synchronic, Steve investigates and studies the drug to understand what happened to Brianna and the others.

Steve learns that the drug targets the pineal gland, making you experience time as it is — the whole record, not just the needle in the groove. More accurately, it jumps you back in time.

With a soft pineal gland, like someone younger than an adult, you experience different times. Steve happens to have a fatal brain tumor that makes his pineal gland softer than average.

You see where this is going.

While it rests on an astounding number of coincidences — all while the characters talk about randomness, chance, and luck — and half-baked explanations for what Synchronic does, the experience is still pretty fun.

The discussions of life and death, while not profound, ground the story and express where the storytellers cared the most.

The ending, however, is nonsense.

</i>
Svengali (John Barrymore) is a musician who can manipulate people. He often uses it to get money, but when he meets Trilby (Marian Marsh), he uses his hypnosis to control her and make him a singer for his performances.

Trilby is a model looking for work. She shows off her feet, and Billie falls in love with her. But Billie is heartbroken when he sees Trilby modeling nude for a painting. 

He believes that Trilby has left him, but Svengali has taken Trilby as his wife and given her a new identity.

Svengali gains and loses control over Trilby, but he can't seem to make her love him.

Barrymore's prosthetic nose is giving Bradley Cooper in <i>Maestro</i>. Supposedly, they stripped the Jewish association with Svengali, but that's false.

The sets have strange dimensions, feeling close to German Expressionism but with less dramatic lighting.

Being Pre-Code, we see a fair bit of Marian Marsh's legs and feet. It's hard to justify in some places — they just wanted to look at her feet.

This movie is complicated to appreciate because of its antisemitism. Svengali's control over Trilby, however, made me think of producers who controlled young actresses in Hollywood by hooking them on heroin (see Judy Garland). That icky feeling gave this movie some power, however unearned it may be.

Only this time, Harker knows that Dracula is dangerous and intends to use his position to end Dracula's reign of terror.

Van Helsing (Peter Cushing) rides into town to find Harker. In this version, they are already friends and working together to stop Dracula.

The plot changes help speed up the time to action — so much so that Harker gets only a few minutes of screen time before Dracula takes him.

The movie still has some lulls, especially with getting Lucy's family on board. But I love Hammer, and I love Lee and Cushing together, so this would have to be pretty bad for me not to at least like it.","max, hooptober, hooptoberx, 1001 movies, vampires, britsploitation, dracula",2023-10-22

A reporter named Lee Taylor sneaks into Doctor Xavier's lab to learn all the details he can for a scandalizing story on the doctor.

The result is a science lab murder mystery, where Doctor Xavier summons all the suspects, digging into their personal history and using bizarre methods of deduction to narrow it down. But it seems that the killer is taking out suspects as well.

This movie has a lot of comedic beats — Lee Tracy plays erratic and is full of gags (he shakes several hands with a hand-buzzer). His scenes have strong Scooby-Doo vibes — dark hands nearly grabbing him, falling into random chutes, passing out, and whatnot.

The cinematography is gorgeous! Maybe it's the combination of color and early 30s filming style that makes it stand out, but I had genuine spine tingles in a few scenes. And the lighting is so dramatic!

I love the greens in this! I'm so happy that we have this surviving red-green Technicolor print. It makes this movie feel special (I talk more about it below, but that's so I can have that history on hand).

I love this movie — it's so whacky.


<b>*** Historical Aside ***</b>
Technicolor destroyed all of their red-green negatives in the 40s since they printed them on nitrate film, which is dangerously combustible (one of the contributing reasons we lose so many old films).

But that isn't why color didn't become more mainstream earlier on. The studios weren't getting positive responses from test audiences, so they switched back to cheaper black-and-white processing.

We had black-and-white copies of this movie, but we thought we had lost the color version. When Jack Warner died in 78, they opened his vault and found a surviving color nitrate print.

They transferred the print to safety film — the standard for color prints that studios switched to during the 40s, but then WWII happened, and the war demanded all of the safety film. That's why studios didn't transition to color until the 50s.

The nitrate print went into UCLA's Film and Television Archive. The archive did a digital restoration in 2020, and a Blu-ray version came out the following year.

Their ill fates trouble him, but Ursula (Myrna Loy), a schoolmate on the outskirts of their clique, sends out the letters without him knowing.

June Raskob, a trapeze circus act, receives one of the letters, which declares that the stars dictate that she kill someone, directly or indirectly. In the show that night, she didn't catch her sister, and the sister falls to her death.

Hazel Cousins (Pet Entwisle) receives a letter saying bloodshed is in her future. She subsequently stabs her husband to death.

After these deaths, the women reach out to one another, some fearful of their fates, but one in particular, Laura Stanhope (Irene Dunne), doesn't buy into astrology and calls whoever she can to dissuade the others of their fears

Ursula continues to work in the background as women die one by one.

<blockquote><i>Something makes someone kill themselves. So suicide is murder. Trouble is, you can't arrest a ""something,"" can you?</i></blockquote>I love how many women are in this! What a powerhouse cast.

Myrna Loy is such a hypnotic presence! I can see why she had such an influence on the goth scene. It's a bummer that she plays ""half-Javanese,"" but that happened a lot with her.

Irene Dunne plays so vibrant and independent. She reminds me of Sigourney Weaver.

Jo Turner gets the comedic lines — nothing overtly funny, just small relief moments.

Florence Eldridge's Grace is in love with death — I love how melodramatic she is.

The film uses a starburst transition after every death.

This movie presents a genuine critique of whiteness — Ursula was raped as a child for her ""exotic"" looks. She tried to pass as white as she grew older, but the clique she targeted mocked her mixed heritage and wouldn't let her pass. Of course, she's a murderous villain, so whatever her misery was, she's ""gone too far."" But to be able to voice those resentments is another example of how much damage The Hayes Code did.

Five strangers on a tour enter a crypt, unsure of what compelled them, and encounter the Crypt Keeper (Ralph Richardson). One by one, he shows them each how they die.

Based on the Tales from the Crypt comics, the stories come from various horror comics and collections.

The structure is similar to the Torture Garden, which makes sense since Amicus produced both.

<b>…And All Through the House ***.5</b>

On Christmas Eve, Joanne Clayton kills her husband before tucking in her daughter good night. A homicidal maniac has coincidentally escaped, dressed as Santa Claus. When Joanne spots the maniac outside her house, she cannot call the police lest she reveal her murder as well.

The segment is tight and sharply filmed. In true comic fashion, it uses several quick moments to add color to the narrative.

<b>Reflection of Death ***</b>

Carl Maitland leaves home in the night to go to work. He meets up with his secretary there, and they drive off together. He drifts off in the passenger seat, having a nightmare. Once awake, the two get into a car accident.

When he comes to, the car has caught fire. He walks home, but he horrifies every person he sees.

The segment effectively uses a first-person perspective, hiding Carl’s face from the viewer until the end.

<b>Poetic Justice ***.5</b>

James Elliot and his father live across from an older man, Arthur Grimsdyke (Peter Cushing), whom the two Elliots despise as a blight on the neighborhood.

James begins a campaign of terror, taking everything Grimsdyke holds dear from him and driving him to suicide. But Grimdyke dabbled in the occult, conferring with his late wife before death.

This segment is more involved than the previous two, having a more complex plot. Cushing does a wonderful job as a delightful neighbor, and the torture he goes through is heartbreaking.

The special effects in this are also outstanding — I can’t say too much without spoiling it.

<b>Wish You Were Here **.5</b>

Ralph Jason has to sell off all of his goods. His wife, Enid, reminisces over a Chinese figurine, discovering that it grants three wishes. Each wish, of course, has a deplorable consequence.

This segment is a ""monkey's paw"" variant. Ralph even says he read ""The Monkey's Paw"" in school and warns Enid not to make a wish, but she tries to wish them out of their financial situation.

This one is gory, with intestines and dismembered limbs flailing about. It doesn’t fit with the rest of the stories — the person who committed the moral sin is not the story's subject. It also makes little sense with the ending of the collection.

<b>Blind Alleys ***.5</b>

William Rogers becomes a director for a home of the blind. He makes dramatic cuts to the budget so that he may live comfortably, leading to a revolt from some residents.

They lock him and his dog Shane away, letting them starve for a while. Like a bunch of Jigsaw Killers, they construct a maze for him to get through, filled with danger.

In Gorman's office, Evelyn discovers a snakehead apparatus with faux fangs that emit real venom. She knows she must escape and inform the authorities, no matter the cost. That is if Gorman will let her.

These actors have so much faith in the animals! An assistant secretes the venom from a Green Mamba for testing. A character falls into a pool of alligators. Charlie Ruggles boops a lion on the nose.

This movie would be better without Charlie Ruggles. His obnoxious comic relief follows the Porky Pig school of stumbling over every line.

This film is sexy! Stanwyck and Fonda have tremendous chemistry. One of the best scenes in the movie is the two of them sitting cheek-to-cheek, her playing with his hair, and he blissed out of his mind.

An absolute dipshit tries to uproot a rock in his field. An electrical storm fires up. From beneath the rock rises Rawhead.

The eyes of the stained glass monster glow red, and their light cast upon the altar. Declan O’Brien touches the altar, receives visions, and laughs maniacally.

Rawhead goes on a rampage, but stops when he reaches a pregnant woman — his claws retract.

It didn’t feel like Clive Barker until we got more scenes of Howard and his wife, Elaine. They engage in public intimacy, much to the dismay of a local woman with unsettling eyes. It’s refreshing to see a married couple that loves and supports one another in a horror movie.

The Rawhead Rex design is incredible and awful — he looks like Goro from Mortal Kombat with more cartoonish jowls.

The movie falters when it requires strong emotional performances. Also, it’s clear that the screenplay holds more potential than what the director realizes on-screen.

There’s a scene where O’Brien kneels and lets Rawhead Rex pee on him to “baptize” him. There’s the Clive Barker I know.

The druid shit is amusing, even if makes little sense. No one is doing a good job in this slow and boring movie. It's at least more entertaining than the previous entry, but not by much.

I've heard about the Producer's Cut and how it puts more of the curse details together, but I don't care enough to seek it out. Classic Weinstein fuckery.

I only watched this to complete the original movies.

<b>CURSE LORE</b>

The Curse of Thorn is a runic symbol based on the constellation Thorn, appearing during Samhain (the druidic precursor to Halloween). To prevent plagues and curses from affecting the entire tribe, one family would bear the curse. The curse drives the bearer to kill their entire family, granting them inhuman strength and immunity from death. They placed the curse on the family's child, making them pure evil.

Why does Michael kill others if the cursed child is only supposed to kill his family? Maybe it’s anyone who stands in his way, but it ends up being anyone he encounters. Sort of defeats the purpose of cursing only one family to preserve the others.","amc+, Slasher",2023-10-25

On Halloween 1998, twenty years after the events of <i>Halloween I</i> and <i>II</i>, someone murdered Loomis and took his file on Laurie Strode.

Laurie Strode faked her death and went into hiding, changing her name to Keri Tate. She is the headmistress of a private boarding school and has a son named John (Josh Hartnett).

Michael now knows where to find them.

Kids in school are talking about Frankenstein and how he waited until he had nothing left to confront his monster. Laurie won’t give him the chance.

After 17 years of skipping Halloween for his mother’s sake, Laurie gives John permission to go on a school field trip. Except John doesn’t go on the trip. He, his girlfriend Molly (Michelle Williams), and another couple hide away in the school to have an evening to themselves.

Michael Meyers is quietly stalking the premises, biding his time to strike.

We get the Laurie that fights back! Laurie couldn't move past her trauma, as she wasn't certain if it had ended. She was sadly right. But man, Jamie Lee Curtis rules in this.

Steve Miner, who is best known for <i>Soul Man</i>, directed this film, but the screenplay shows the unmistakable touch of Kevin Williamson, the writer of <i>Scream</i>. It’s not as good as his <i>Scream</i> movies, but it’s a sizable improvement to the previous <i>Halloween</i> sequels.

Laurie is in a mental health facility for a disassociative disorder. The guy she beheaded in <i>H20</i> was not Michael Meyers. Michael dressed as a paramedic and escaped, putting a paramedic with a crushed larynx in the body bag with his mask on.

Sure.

Spotting Michael outside, Laurie sets a trap on the roof and catches him. She tries to remove his mask to ensure she’s killing the right person, but he stabs her. She drops to her death.

A year later, six kids won a contest to be on a web show called Dangertainment. They have to stay the night in Michael’s childhood home to understand what led him to kill. What’s the worst that could happen?

Webcams, Yahoo chats, and SMS — welcome to the future.

Katee Sackhoff shows up just before her <i>Battlestar Galactica</i> gig. I wish she had a character in this.

Moustapha Akkad inserted a clause that prevented Michael from being killed off. Jamie Lee Curtis negotiated to have <i>H20</i> at least appear as though Michael died and that she dies as soon as possible in the sequel. She knew we could throw this one away.

When Dean slits his throat in the middle of a diner, Kris (Katie Cassidy) and Nacy (Rooney Mara) watch in horror. Kris notices the trembling hands and tense body language, signifying he did it against his will.

During Dean's funeral, Kris witnesses the unsettling sight of her younger self, with a visibly injured chest, present at the ceremony. When Kris looks at the memorial pictures, she can see herself and Dean playing together as children. Except she doesn't remember meeting Dean until high school.

After the funeral, Kris tries to tell her ex, Jesse (Thomas Dekker), what she saw. But Jesse gaslights Kris and advises her to give up her obsession, claiming she is behaving irrationally. While staying together, though, he witnesses the terrifying image of Kris thrashing about the room and collapsing on the bed, covered in blood.

With Jesse in prison, Nancy and her friend, Quentin (indie darling Kyle Gallner), try to understand what's happening. They only know they dream of Freddy Kruger, covered in burn scars.

As the grip of sleep deprivation tightens, Nancy and Quentin gradually piece together the intertwined past of all the victims. What's worse, their parents know about it.

I'm not as offended by this as others, maybe because I don't have nostalgia for the original series.

I like the mood of the dream world and how it all bleeds together. I also like how the movie uses its time with each character to develop the audience's relationship with them. The logic behind Freddy's victim choices is more meaningful in this movie.

Katie Cassidy does well in this movie! The other performances are fine. I'd blame the script before the actors — except for Thomas Dekker. I don't know what that guy is doing.

CGI Freddy is so lame, though. They had an actor but lacked faith in the makeup department to create a convincing burn victim look, so they compromised the performance. It undercuts their effort to make this Freddy scarier.

Also, they still gave him lame quips.

Gigablast.

A masked killer murders Isabella, a fashion house model, dragging her away, her stocking glimmering in the backlight.

The models and staff at the fashion house grow weary with the thought of a killer on the loose. But they become terrified when they learn that Isabella kept a diary with all the dirty secrets. Perhaps one of the secrets was what led to her murder.

This movie is so gorgeous. The color is vibrant, and the cinematography is confident. The result is an uncanny murder mystery where the world feels genuine and fabricated, the way fashion reflects a distorted reality back to us.

Bill (TV's Jeff Fahey) is a criminal psychologist. Leaving a consultation, he gets in a car wreck. Bill loses an arm, but doctors perform an experimental surgery to graft a new arm onto him. Before he goes under, he sees several surgeons with shotguns and others dismembering a body.

In a class he teaches, he explores the motivations of what could make a seemingly functional human turn violent. During the class, he keeps having visions of blood and strangulation.

His arm has a tattoo, ""Striker"" — a tattoo only given to death row inmates. Running his prints through AFID, he learns his new arm belonged to a convicted serial killer.

<blockquote><i>You have this guy's arm. You don't have his personality.</i></blockquote>

Remo (Brad Dourif) got the other arm and now paints disturbing images — the same images Bill sees in his head. Mark has the legs and can dunk a basketball but can't control his car.

The three band together, even though Bill seems to be the only one suffering. That is until Mark returns home, and someone is waiting to take his legs.

X Gonna Give It To Ya — by ""it"", I mean terrible headaches and visions beyond your comprehension.

Dr. James Xavier (Ray Milland) is experimenting with vision, trying to see beyond the 10% of the spectrum available to humans. He has developed an eye drop serum he calls X.

He tries the serum on monkeys, testing their ability to see lights through a metal wall. But the monkey sees something that puts it in shock before dying.

Tired of the ambiguous results, he tries the serum on himself. His eyes see more than his brain can comprehend. But as his eyes adjust, he can see through things — pieces of paper, ties, jackets. He keeps adding drops to his eyes until he goes unconscious, unable to bear the light.

But as he recovers, he develops X-RAY EYES. No one believes him, so even when he tries to correct a patient's diagnosis, the surgeon says, “fuck you, I’m doing the surgery I want.” He steps in and does the correct surgery anyway, and the surgeon accuses him of malpractice.

Afraid of what will happen, Xavier goes on the run, pushing his X use to the outer limits and experiencing the world as no one has seen it before.

The visual effects are so fun! I love it when everything becomes bleeding lights, and the spectrum smears across each image. They would make perfect concert visuals.

2023-10-28,The Addiction,1995,https://boxd.it/549xQN,4,,"<b>Russell Simmons presents ""Vampires are philosophy doctorates""</b>

Kathleen (Lili Taylor) is a philosophy doctoral student working on her dissertation. Her cohort, Jean (Edie Falco), might be her only friend. The two walk the streets, quiet and fearful.

One night, on Kathleen's walk home, an alluring woman named Casanova draws Kathleen into an alley.

<blockquote><i>Tell me to go, and I'll leave you alone.</i></blockquote>

But Kathleen only cries as Casanova bites her neck and draws blood.
<blockquote><i>Collaborator.</i></blockquote>

Kathleen reports the woman to the police and then ambles home, her neck loosely bandaged and still bleeding, with tears and convulsions. The next few days are hell as Kathleen's body and mind change, as though she is experiencing withdrawal from a drug she's never consumed.

She comes across a man passed out on the street. She draws his blood with a syringe. Back home, she finds a vein and injects the blood into her body, giving her relief from the torment.
<blockquote><i>It makes no difference what I do, whether I draw blood or not. It's the violence of my will against theirs.</i></blockquote>

Kathleen decides to take the existential philosophy that she has studied and embody it in her actions. She is an ego creating her own will to power, her morality based on what she knows.
<blockquote><i>— How could you do this? Doesn't this affect you at all?
</i><i>— No. It was your decision... It's not my indifference that's the problem. It's your astonishment that needs studying.</i></blockquote>

But on the fringes of that philosophy is a religious underpinning — a Catholic background that permeates the thoughts. A determinism that says god has already decided who will go to heaven and who to hell. Sinners are unconscious of evil, predestined for hell. Suffering and guilt are signs that god is working on your salvation.
<blockquote><i>Look sin in the face and tell it to go</i></blockquote>

Victim after victim she takes, not to take their life but to inject her philosophy into their bloodstream. She is an evangelical, inviting others into the suffering that may lead to their salvation.
<blockquote><i>Prove there's no evil, and you can go</i></blockquote>

One night, she tries to take Peina (Christopher Walken), but like Jesus in the desert, he knows her philosophy and turns it back on her. He claims to have fasted from blood for 40 years, learning to survive on a little.

<blockquote><i> I'll teach you what hunger is</i></blockquote>

He drains her of nearly all of her blood. She cannot die this way, so she will only suffer pain. And what is pain to a demon spending eternity suffering in hell? Self-revelation is the annihilation of self. If there is no ego, there is no will to enact on others. In this practice, Peina has almost become human again — walking in daylight and drinking tea.
<blockquote><i>You're not a person. You're nothing </i></blockquote>

But Kathleen cannot stand the pain of detox and runs out and draws more blood.
<blockquote><i>The dual nature to the addiction — it satisfies the hunger that evil engenders, but it also dulls our perception so we are helped to forget how ill we are. We drink to escape the fact we're alcoholics. Existence is the search for a release from our habit, and our habit is the only relief we can find.</i></blockquote>

She turns towards her doctoral dissertation, finalizing what she has come to understand. That philosophy is propaganda — an ego attempts to influence an object — to change its worldview.

<blockquote><i>Essence is revealed through praxis — our impact on other egos</i></blockquote>

And with that, she gathers her converts, and they put their philosophy into practice.

<blockquote><i> We're not evil because of the evil we do. We do evil because we are evil. And what choices do such people have?</i></blockquote>

But god isn't done with her yet.
<blockquote><i>Guilt doesn't pass with time, Jean. It's eternal.</i></blockquote>

Buck (Robert Englund) wants to fuck, so he goes to Miss Hattie's. But the sex worker he purchased, Clara (Roberta Collins), isn't up for the job and runs away to The Starlight, a rundown hotel in the swamp.

<blockquote><i>There ain't no such word as ""no""</i></blockquote>The hotel owner, Judd (Neville Brand), has an odd energy and keeps an African crocodile penned up in the swamp waters. He accommodates Clara until he figures that she came from Miss Hattie's. So, he kills her and throws her to the crocodile.

A family rolls up — mother Faye, father Roy, young daughter Angie, and a little dog named Snoopy. Faye and Roy are fighting and discussing divorce, and Snoopy is barking at the crocodile. His little dog ego can't take it, and he has to go in against the crocodile, and the crocodile eats him.

<blockquote><i>Ain't nothing nobody can do about it. It's all according to the instincts</i></blockquote>To prove his worth, Roy goes to the car to grab a shotgun and kill the crocodile. But Judd won't let him. He cuts Roy down with a scythe and throws him to the crocodile. Judd then tries to proposition Faye in his confused way — by walking in while she's starting a shower. When she rejects him, he beats her and ties her up. Angie escapes underneath the house.

Also, Harvey and his daughter Libby drive up. They're looking for Harvey's missing daughter, Clara. Judd claims not to know her, saying she must be one of Miss Hattie's girls, sending Harvey and Libby on the hunt.

Judd's world is closing in on him. His thoughts won't leave him alone, no matter how loud he turns up the music. So when Buck drives up, everything begins to unravel.

If I had seen this a year ago, I would've dismissed it as a cheap bummer of a follow-up to one of the most horrifying movies ever made. While this is no <i>Texas Chainsaw Massacre</i>, its contained reality strikes closer to the America beneath your nose.


<b>Overwrought Analysis for Fun and Profit (Spoilers Ahead):</b>

Judd is a sort of anti-Norman Bates. His mental illness is well-known, but like Miss Hattie's, everyone ignores it as long as it remains on the periphery. But as his core is repression that can only sublimate through feeding people to his crocodile, cutting them down with a reaper scythe, separating the wheat from the chaff

When he sought the comfort of someone to talk to with sex workers, they sent him away — they prefer to reward the Buck's who want to fuck like a ""normal"" red-blooded country boy. Even when Buck is violent, his motives make sense to them

And it makes sense why Judd hates Buck and why Judd kills more men than he does women. In part, it's because male machismo doesn't recognize a threat when it's in their face — like Buck doing a rooster impersonation, they stand their ground, assuming they have what the right people want.

I think Judd is a latent bisexual, if not homosexual. He doesn't want Miss Hattie's girls. He wants Buck but could never have him. The final scene is Judd's wooden leg floating in the water with bisexual lighting.

Similarly, the women who understand their role to these men are left alive. When they cry and resist, that's when the violence comes. When they smoke a cigarette and roll their eyes, that's when the violence comes.

But since Faye isn't a sex worker, Judd doesn't know how to respond to her. He has her in his grasp, but he doesn't want to kill her, and he doesn't want to fuck her either. So he ties her up, putting her on pause so that he has some sense of domination.","shudder, hooptoberx, hooptober, video nasties, nature attacks, hicksploitation, Slasher",2023-10-28

Similar to Jurassic Park, this movie takes an eye thought up by an eight-year-old and tries to make it work. Inevitably, it involves experiences only available to the rich, warnings from brilliant but ignored scientists, and chases when things go wrong.

<i>10 Rillington Place, London, 1944</i>

John Christie (Richard Attenborough) lures Muriel Eddy (Phyllis MacMahon) to his flat. He convinces her he has an inhalent to cure her bronchitis. He instead forces her to inhale coal gas, strangling her and having sex with her body before burying her in the yard.

Four years later, Christie and his wife, Ethel (Patricia Heywood), rent out a flat in the building. Tim Evans (John Hurt), his wife Beryl (Judy Geeson), and his infant daughter Geraldine rent it.

Christie looks for opportunities to isolate Beryl. He learns Beryl is pregnant, and that Tim is functionally illiterate. Christie uses that to convince Tim and Beryl that he is a doctor. Beryl wants an abortion, and Christie offers to give it to her, warning Tim (but not Beryl) that she may die from the procedure.

He kills Beryl and tricks Tim into believing she died during surgery, making Tim think he played a part in her death.

Tim has a violent temper. His yelling is loud enough to notify neighbors. Christie convinces Tim to run away and pretend he’s on vacation with Beryl. Christie claims to know a family that can care for the baby. Once Tim leaves, Christie murders Geraldine. He tells his wife that Tim did it in one of his rages.

Tim hides out with his aunt and uncle, but he can’t handle the guilt, so he goes to the police to confess. He tries to keep Christie out of his story, making up something about a bottle of stuff that was supposed to abort the baby. This starts the downward spiral that allows Christie to frame Tim for the murder. The court finds Tim guilty and sentences him to execution by hanging.

I’ve never seen Attenborough play such a dark character. Attenborough accepted the role because England considered bringing back the death penalty. He hoped the movie would remind people of the consequences. The jury believed Christie more than Evans because of his lower-class background and false testimony to protect Christie.

John Hurt is heartbreaking. He’s convincing as a confused man way in over his head. Tim Evans was not an innocent person, nor was he the murderer he was made out to be.

This does a tremendous job of making me feel icky. It errs on the side of not depicting the full details of the murders. This keeps the film from feeling too exploitative. It also does a tremendous job of not trying to pad out the characters — we don’t know why Christie did what he did. Also, it isn’t essential for the anti-capital punishment message that the movie aspires towards.","amazon prime, hooptober, hooptoberx, britsploitation, serial killer",2023-10-30

Rosetta, a teen living on a campground with her alcoholic mother, loses a trial assignment job after the company decides not to hire her full time. She lashes out and attacks her boss. Security chases her down and evicts her from the premises.

Back home, Mom is drinking again. She’s cooking some donated food, but Rosetta throws it out, not willing to accept handouts.

She mends clothes to sell, keeps fish traps, and never stops looking for another job. She throws her friend under the bus who tries to make money under the table, ratting him out to his boss to get his job.

She’s cutthroat, but tries to be honest in all of her dealings. Her mother’s reliance on others for charity is something she wants to avoid. She has a firm determination to show that she can achieve her goals without relying on anyone else.

If she wasn’t so stubborn, she might realize she didn’t have to go alone. Accepting help is crucial for many of us.

The film never moralizes about whether Rosetta is doing the right thing, or anyone else. It’s one of those stories where we watch the events as they unfold and their consequences.

Since this movie came out, filmmakers have tortured this formula in the name of Oscar noms. Making that film is still possible. For example, To Leslie works. It’s just more common.

The camera does everything it can to keep up with Rosetta, staying as tight as possible on her. She’ll slam doors in its face — she ducks behind walls — she runs into the woods. It always catches up with her. Yet another stylistic choice that has become widespread in recent years.

Lucy (Brooke Markham) and Karen (VyVy Nguyen) go to an abandoned camp to wait for the full moon. Lucy has a wound on their forearm. While waiting, they dig through crap in Karen’s car, such as a trapper keeper full of spells and a gun. You know, for when Lucy turns into a werewolf.

A guy in a werewolf rubber mask jumps up to their car window, spooking Karen. She shoots them by accident with the gun.

We cut to one day earlier. The two friends work in an unpopular ice cream store with annoying coworker Eric. As night falls and closing time approaches, a woman enters, covered in foliage and wearing a hand puppet whose mouth is full of teeth. The woman tries to buy ice cream with a pinecone. When denied, the woman bites Lucy with the puppet.

In the present, Lucy wakes up alone and naked in the wilderness. Where is Karen? Who did they shoot last night? And what’s that haunting howling she hears in the distance?

Sung Kang, known for his role as Han in the Fast & Furious movies, directed the movie. It is lighthearted, with dark humor and gross-out moments peppered throughout. The horror elements drive the story, but the movie isn't scary.

Brooke Markham and VyVy Nguyen have good friendship chemistry. The characters’s shared history allows them to draw on that past to move the plot forward and keep it (somewhat) believable.

<blockquote><i>I’ve come to realize, things aren’t really that complicated.

If the second chance comes, we might not need it after all. We are where we need to be.

A witch named Old Maid Maria claims a woman's infant daughter named Nevena, rendering her mute. The mother tries to hide Nevena away in a cave her whole life. 

Then, at 16, Maria appears, assuming the mother's form, leading Nevena into the woods. There, Maria uses her one witching spit to turn Nevena into a witch like her. When Nevena does not consume living things the way Maria does, Maria abandons her to fend for herself.

Similar to Maria, Nevena possesses the ability to consume individuals and take on their appearance. She finds people living in a nearby village and watches them live their lives. As her curiosity grows about their lives, she kills and consumes one of them to experience life as them.

Maria hides amongst the trees. She looks on as Nevena's life unfolds, feeling a combination of mockery and envy.

With a poetic cadence, this movie is a folktale that relishes the humanity of everyday life. These moments provide Nevena with the opportunity to live a life that her mother had previously deprived her of.

</b>
Benoît is a 15-year-old boy growing up in an Asbestos Region mining town in Quebec during the 1940s. His uncle Antoine is the town undertaker, and Antoine works for him there, as well as at the general store Antoine runs with his wife Cécile. While the film predominantly follows Benoît's point of view, it also encompasses a larger depiction of the town.

When winter comes to the small town, Benoît helps decorate the store and set up the nativity scene in the storefront window. During this time, we see Benoît sneak alcohol, flirt with his crush, and watch a woman change clothes. You know, teenage mistakes.

Then, a kid that is Benoît's age gets sick and dies. Benoît asks to come along with Antoine to pick up the body, not aware of what he's getting into. Along the way, he learns more about his uncle than he could want. He also experiences the grim reality of someone he knows dying and how mundane and unceremonious the gritty details are.

If the first half of the movie explores Benoît's childhood, the second half explores those first lines we cross into adulthood. That place is where we learn how disappointing and flawed adults are. He sees firsthand how mistakes stop being something you can apologize for. He discovers accidents can have lasting consequences.

The film watches people closely, finding small moments with each. It paints a picture so specific that it has to be based on the writer or filmmaker's personal experiences.

The two sit together on the balcony and kiss. Joan invites Jerry to a tea party the next day. Then, a man named Greg Boleslavsky grabs her, and they leave. Jerry offers a toast:

<blockquote><i>Merrily, we go to hell</i></blockquote>

Joan runs gayly around the house, awaiting Jerry's arrival, preparing gingerbread and crème de menthe based on a joke from the previous evening. Jerry doesn't arrive until well after the party, already setting a terrible precedent with her family.

Jerry is an alcoholic and a regular at a local bar. He returns after a stint of absences to tell the regulars that he's getting married. Jerry doesn't seem too pleased, though.

<blockquote><i>— Am I alright to take a swell girl and make her my wife?
— No</i></blockquote>

That doesn't stop him from blabbing it to everyone. This gets in the newspapers, along with dirt on his previous beau, Claire Hempstead. Despite time passing, he still holds onto a picture of Claire in his apartment.

Joan's father tries to pay Jerry off so that he won't marry Joan, but Jerry doesn't fall for the bait. They remain engaged, but Jerry doesn't get to the engagement party. She learns he got too drunk and passed out before he arrived, humiliating Joan.

Nevertheless, they marry. Jerry, of course, loses her wedding ring.

<blockquote><i>I love you so much it doesn't matter</i></blockquote>

The rocky road of this whirlwind romance begins, lacking the chemistry or charm that might make their relationship make sense. Contrast with <i>The Heiress</i>, which establishes a precedent for Catherine's adoration of the first man who pays attention to her. Here, we get a drunken joke at a party.

It should not be surprising that Claire reenters Jerry's life, enabling his alcoholism and stirring up all those old feelings. Joan learns of their affair and begins drinking herself, telling him to go to Claire.

Jerry eventually comes around, so Claire tells him she'll date other folks. She shows up at a party in the arms of Charlie Baxter (Cary Grant).

The movie wants to explore the codependent relationship between an alcoholic and the person who loves them — well before the term existed. Joan defends Jerry at his lowest and tries to leave him way after she should've. We know how that goes.

The movie stands out for its portrayal of extramarital relationships. It also dives into some darker territory that I won't spoil. They are, however, shallow presentations by today's standards with too clean an edge.

This may have played for laughs in 1932. It's more likely that Hollywood has called everything it doesn't understand a comedy since the beginning.

<b>Stray Thoughts</b>
* I can't believe Slyvia Sidney is the afterlife case worker from <i>Beetlejuice</i>!

A rescue team goes into the Amazon to find the documentary crew. The unit comes back with the crew's footage.

They discovered that the documentarians deliberately staged events to create shock value. This includes several animal mutilations, raping native women, and forcing members of the tribe into a hut and setting it on fire. They filmed the whole thing.

It's the classic exploitation move. You show people doing horrible things, then show them getting their comeuppance.

The film takes place in the Fontainhas district of Portugal. It is a shantytown for the disadvantaged and immigrants from former Portuguese territories.

Clothide and Tina are close friends who live in the district. Tina recently gave birth. Clothide tries to bring the father around, but he bails.

At home, Tina turns on the gas for her stove, letting it fill the room so she and the baby can die. The father comes home, sees the scene, and goes to bed. 

The father takes the baby to the more affluent parts of Lisbon to beg for money. A nurse named Edwarda buys him a sandwich and milk for the baby. But something made the baby sick. The father tracks down Edwarda, who becomes entwined in his, Tina, and Clothide's life.

The movie has no musical score. The city and atmosphere form the soundscape. There is minimal dialogue in the film. Most shots are static compositions of the characters going through their lives. Every frame of this movie is beautiful.

The quiet observational quality has Jim Jarmusch vibes but with a greater sense of weight to the depressive lives the characters live.

The movie's fictional nature doesn't detract from its ability to capture the authentic lives of people in the background.

It is still a fictional story with lighting, high-end cameras, and hired actors. It wouldn't be until director Pedro Costa made his next film, <i>In Varda's Room</i>, that he blurred the lines.","criterion channel, criterion, criterion challenge 2023, cc2023",2023-11-02

Authorities warn against going into the woods. Women keep going missing. 

Dastan, sick of his nagging pregnant wife — how dare she need any attention or input from him? — dodges that bitch (his words) and goes fishing in the woods with his friends. 

Meanwhile, a moronic gang of four shoots someone in the head. Our fishing heroes witness it, so the gangsters chase them to kill them.

Emerging from the woods is a man, his face marked with scars. In a sudden act of aggression, he stabs one gangster in the eye, leaving him writhing in agony, and then fades away. The other gang members find him dead and think the fishing boys did it. Do you see where this is going?

The movie highlights its disdain for women with the only other female character, a gas station attendant with acne. She repulses the men so much they don’t get their change for their purchases.

The movie draws its humor primarily from gory murders and scatological humor. While it may not be inherently wrong to use these for laughs, in this context, it becomes joyless and cruel.

In the end, the message seems to be, “Boys just need their bros, you know?” Otherwise, it’s a hastily constructed grouping of gross-out gags.

Two boys, Octavio and Jorge, are speeding down the road. There's a bleeding black dog in the backseat. A big yellow SUV is chasing after them, handguns pointing out the windows. They try to lose the SUV. They end up in a car crash.

The movie follows three stories about people making major transitions in their lives. The stories intertwine throughout the film. They all converge at the car wreck scene.

Octavio and Jorge introduce Octavio's dog, Cofi, to the world of dogfighting after discovering that Cofi killed another dog in a fight. He intends to save up and run away with his brother Romero's wife, Susana. Life doesn't play fair, though, especially when you're unfaithful. 

In the following story, Daniel leaves his wife and two kids to start a new life with a supermodel named Valeria. No sooner than when they move in together, Valeria gets in a car wreck. The wreck breaks her leg and effectively ends her modeling career. Daniel cares for her in their new apartment together. Things get worse for the couple when Valeria's dog, Richie, falls through a broken floorboard and gets stuck under the apartment floor.

In the third, a hitman and former guerrilla named El Chivo is trying to reconnect with the daughter he abandoned 20 years ago. Before he can complete a hit, he witnesses a car wreck. He saves Cofi from the wreckage.

Of the three stories, the middle story is the weak link. The car wreck is the only link between this story and the others. By focusing on the other two stories, we can cut 30-40 minutes and have a stronger ending.

The movie's most notable success is making it look like dogs fight and die. Iñárritu discussed using clever editing and sound design to make all the scenes with dogs fighting look real. The dogs were actually playing with one another. Once you know that, it's easier to tell in the movie.

On an island, a nun runs away from a convent carrying an amulet. The amulet depicts the face of a humanoid monster. In the convent sanctuary, a priest reads from a text in an unknown language, its pages imprinted with the same monstrous images.

In the rainstorm, the walls of the convent break, flooding the church. Something in the water kills the priest.

As the storm breaks, the nun emerges from the cliffside. Something pushes her off the cliff, the amulet shattering against the rocks. Other nuns take and hide the remaining pieces.

Twenty years later, Elizabeth receives a letter from her friend Theresa urging her to come to the remote island convent.

But Theresa is missing. Instead, Sarah greets her.

Sarah takes Elizabeth to a blind Mother Superior, who speaks in strange clicks and chitters that a translator interprets for them.

The Mother Superior tells her she will understand in time.

The movie has incredible world-building that drew me in almost immediately. I'm a sucker for an island full of dark secrets and hidden passages, and this movie has plenty of both.

The soundtrack has a synth orchestration, distorted like old tape running and skipping. It drones and hiccups, inspiring dread.

The movie never treats the audience like they're stupid — we get to the island, we get the rundown, and the exploration begins. Sarah loves Sherlock Holmes, so she is also eager to unravel the mystery. What they learn won't shock or surprise any horror fans, but the journey is fun.

Noriko (Setsuko Hara) is a twenty-seven-year-old who lives with her father, Professor Shukichi Somiya (Chishū Ryū). 

Shukichi is a widower, and his daughter has not been married. Noriko became sick during the war but is getting better.

Noriko takes a trip to Tokyo, where she sees a friend of her father's, Professor Jo Onodera, who was a widower and recently remarried. The idea of getting remarried bothers Noriko, which she tells Onodera to his face. He laughs at the thought.

It's wild to think that this film went through strict censorship by the Allied Powers' military occupation. They found some ideas ""outdated"" and ""feudalistic,"" contradicting the censor's aim to bring Japan into the modern era.

And yet, Ozu could still subvert the censorship and present his appreciation for Japanese tradition.

Ozu builds gorgeous compositions in every frame, insisting on a still, measured performance from the actors.

His frequent use of multiple shots for establishing the scene for each transition influenced manga and anime. This stylistic choice is now almost synonymous with Japanese culture because of its prevalence in media. 

His sense of timing and space slows the story down, intentionally so, giving the film a more reflective nature. He lets us watch characters think and feel without giving us an explanation for what could motivate them. This stylistic pacing has become a staple of the contemporary slow cinema movement.

Quiet, beautiful, and lighthearted, the film tells a slice-of-life story with deep emotional undercurrents.

It's hard to overstate the impact of this landmark film on cinema history.","criterion channel, criterion, criterion challenge 2023, cc2023, sight and sound",2023-11-04

<blockquote></i>I don't think I like being in love. It puts a bit in my mouth.</i></blockquote>

In the 1870s, T.C. Jeffords (Walter Houston) laid claim to a sum of land called The Furies in New Mexico, and his daughter Vance (Barbara Stanwyck) is the heir to his estate. If T.C. is going to give Vance The Furies, she must marry a man T.C. can stand.

To settle things up with Anaheim Bank, T.C. must chase off the squatters on the land (aka the folks living there when T.C. claimed it). One family, The Herreras, is close to Vance, and Juan Herrera has been her secret friend since childhood.

Vance meets Rip Darrow (Wendell Corey), who holds a mutual grudge with T.C. over a piece of his family’s land that T.C. bought through a technicality. Vance falls in love with Rip, but T.C. warns her that Rip is only into money. Sure enough, when T.C. bribes Rip to leave Vance, Rip takes the money without hesitation.

Vance is heartbroken, but her worries increase as her father courts Flo Burnett, who plans to marry T.C. for his money and to manage The Furies. Where love once lived in Vance’s heart, hate consumes all else as she conspires to reclaim The Furies for herself.

This movie says Western on the box, but it’s more complex than that. It contains melodrama, screwball comedy, and even some noir as it dives into darker territory. There are no clear-cut heroes or villains, just individuals with competing desires and the deceitful measures they take to fulfill them.

The film implies women ran the West, manipulating men behind the scenes to do their bidding. That rules.

Barbara Stanwyck is so charismatic! She has lines in this that had me pumping my fists and cheering.

Economic, and at others breathtaking, the cinematography and lighting will sneak up on you. The sun gives a backlit glow to scenes that transcend the movie.

The only reason this isn’t a 5 for me is the rampant misogyny. Stanwyck gets slapped a bunch.

Where did the vampire blood come from? How will their son handle never growing older? As their nosey neighbors and friends come by to check on them, they wonder if they haven’t traded one prison for another.

The acting is pretty consistent. Nelly Karim and Dhafer L’Abidine are good in a soap opera way. The kids appear robotic, as if directed to be. I mean walking around the house, turning their head before their body, their arms pinned by their sides type of robotic.

The color and cinematography are passable, bordering on good in some scenes. Some tighter shots and better lighting would help this tremendously. The lighting borders on cruel to some of the older actors.

A documentary focusing on the history of Black gospel music told through the genre's pioneers — Reverend Thomas Dorsey and Mother Willa Mae Ford Smith.

Thomas Dorsey is the person who took the old hymns and spirituals and pepped them up, releasing them under the name ""Gospel."" He organized the conventions that helped it spread worldwide. His interfaith, nondenominational approach made Gospel music a unifying, uplifting force. Until his dying day, he toured the world to teach choirs the gospel style.

Both he and Willa Mae Ford Smith had Blues backgrounds. Dorsey found Sallie Martin and Willa Mae, hiring them to go around singing his Gospel songs and selling them to the church after the service.

Willa Mae took over the gospel soloist part of the convention for Dorsey. She brought up all the standout gospel singers up through the 1980s.

This is what documentary does best — it preserves history, gives it a story to pass down, and keeps it alive.

But a story requires omission and manipulation. Nierenberg did so by setting up scenes and pushing folks to talk about contentious subjects. It's the practice at the heart of reality television. Still, this has truth at the heart of it that outshines the petty drama.

They take a candle downstairs and grab a canister of gas. They step outside, open the canister, and douse themselves with the gas, dropping the candle at their feet and self-immolating. These are the last moments of Richard Marlowe (Rutger Hauer), a notorious British composer who disappeared at the peak of his career.

Rose (Freya Tingley) plays the violin in a sound studio. Charles (Simon Abkarian), her manager and legal guardian, arrives to inform her that her father is dead. She did not know her father, as he left when she was a baby. He was none other than Richard Marlowe. She inherits Marlowe’s musical copyrights and the keys to his secluded French mansion. One key came in a separate envelope with her name inscribed in delicate cursive.

She flies out to the estate, violin in hand. A beautifully inscribed mantle lines the stairwell up to the black halls of the second floor. At the end, a locked door — Marlowe’s office. She enters the disheveled room to find a locked desk drawer. The key from the envelope matches the lock. Inside, she finds a folder embossed with an unknown seal containing a violin sonata. Besides the standard musical notation, red ink annotates staves with mysterious symbols.

Rose brings the notation over to the piano. As she stabs out the notes, she catches in the corner of her eye a demonic silhouette forming in the light from the window. When she stops playing, it disappears. As she explores the house, she finds the mysterious symbols from the score and their sinister meaning.

The first act had me hooked. A brilliant musician inheriting a mysterious mansion and a satanic sonata is my deal. The film spends far too much of its runtime expositing on the mysterious Richard Marlowe, but the tight editing keeps it moving.

The film explores success and the lengths people go for it. The idea of someone stepping down at their artistic peak baffles and frustrates the artist who would love to have that attention. But nothing kills the artist more than when passion becomes business. 

The soundtrack fluctuates between cliches and feverous intensity. The movie goes to dark places and saves its most intense music for those reveals.

Diouana (Mbissine Thérèse Diop), a Senegalese woman, moves to France to care for a family’s children. 

When she arrives at the airport, waves of white eyes watch her movement, hesitant and suspicious. Security marks her suitcase for inspection. 

When Diouana arrives, she sees an African mask on the wall. The doors are closed, the Madame yells. She cooks and cleans. But where are the children?

<blockquote><i>For me, France is the kitchen, the living room, the bathroom, and my bedroom. Where are the people who live in this country?</blockquote>

The Madame criticizes Diouana for dressing in nice clothes. She forces Diouana to wear an apron so it is clear to their dinner guests that she is the help. The hosts have her make rice and sell it to the guests as “genuine African cooking.” No surprise, they find the rice very spicy. When the guests decide to leave, they kiss Diouana on the cheeks, exclaiming, “They’ve never kissed a black girl before!”

We get glimpses of her life before France, when she lived in Senegal, outside of Dakar. We learn how Diouana met Madame, who picked her on the street to be her maid. She gifted Madame the mask that hangs on their wall. In France, she expected to be a caregiver to the children, like in Dakar.

They call her an animal but a “good maid.”

<b>Paris, 1845</b>

Horny medical students and their girlfriends make their way through a series of carnival sideshows.

Arab woman's belly-dancing, Native American men tying up a white man, and Erik the Ape Man — the monster who walks upright, the beast with a human soul, the ape who talks.

Dr. Mirakle (Bela Lugosi) is the carnival sideshow entertainer who translates for Erik and expresses his link in the evolutionary chain.

A priest decries heresy as Dr. Mirakle describes his experiments of mixing human and ape blood.

At night, Dr. Mirakle rides the streets, looking for his next victim. He witnesses two men, knives in hand, carving at one another. A woman stands by, watching, screaming. Both men kill each other. Dr. Mirakle approaches through the fog, his eyes aglow in the light of a single streetlamp. He offers her safety in his icy grip.

At home, he ties her to a crux decussata, drawing and mixing her blood with Erik's, only to find impurities that make it unusable. He kills her, the third in a series of murders that the police cannot solve. One of the medical students, Pierre, performs his autopsy. His inquiries lead him back to Dr. Mirakle.

Bela Lugosi does stellar work here. It helps that they wrote the role for him. There is hardly any correlation to the Poe story.

The film creates Rococo moments, such as Camile on a vine-laced swing, to contrast the dark world occupied by the carnival and Dr. Mirakle.

The cinematography and lighting work best in the darker moments, when it composes quiet moments of chiaroscuro.

For an hour-long movie, it's still a little slow in places, opting for characterization over brooding dread for most of its runtime. If they had followed Poe's story closely, this decision would make more sense for a detective story. Here, where horror is the focus, it detracts from the appeal.

Juliette Binoche (credited as She) and her son arrive late to the reading. She invites James to her place to see her gallery of forgeries. James isn’t interested, so she drives him to Lucignano for coffee. They share stories, jokes, and various musings, all spoken in English.

At the coffee shop, James steps outside to answer another call. The Cafe Owner talks with her about marriage and time. She says all her husband cares about is himself and his job and that they’ve been married for 15 years, insinuating that it’s James.

As they leave the cafe, she and James speak in French, and the tone and trajectory of the movie changes.

Some are happy, some are sad. One bride in the background of a shot puts drops in her eyes so that she appears to be crying.

Echoes of love — its hopeful beginnings, its forgetful middles, and its shambling endings. The tolerated quirks from early on become the start of every fight. Memories they thought they shared become disputes about who is right.

After René trash talks the dailies, everyone disperses, except for Zoé, who sees Maggie walking alone. Zoé invites Maggie over, confessing to a friend that she has a crush on Maggie. By the next day, the rumor train is that Zoé and Maggie hooked up.

The chaos continues, and the movie bleeds into reality. Maggie Cheung, decked in her latex costume, becomes the thief. She steals jewelry from an American in her hotel, sneaks to the rooftops, and tosses it off the side of the building.

This film is a meta-textual conversation with French cinema. It discusses where French film is heading. At the heart is the dichotomy of the personal film and the commercial film. It questions if both can exist.

Casting Jean-Pierre Léaud, who played Antoine Doinel in several of Truffaut’s films, is no accident. French New Wave was famous for criticizing French cinema, trying to bring an American sense of energy and play. The act of lamenting cinema is a French act.

Characters compare French films to world cinema. A person interviewing Maggie digresses into a rant about how French film is too insular and personal. He says that they should focus on making more commercial films.

Intentional or not, the film touches on casting racism. René hired Maggie for her “beautiful mystique.” The interviewer wants to talk about John Woo, even though Maggie Cheung is not in any of his movies, let alone familiar with his filmography.

The film ends with a callback to an early French experimental film process, calling for a cultural reset. It offers, however, no answers as to where that direction may be.","criterion channel, criterion, criterion challenge 2023, cc2023, village voice",2023-11-08

<i>Forty Guns</i> is an unusual tragedy and an unintentional one at that. A powerful and wealthy woman forsakes it all for love. As the movie song says, ""She's only a woman after all.""

Jessica Drummond (Barbara Stanwyck) is supposed to be the center of the movie, and it's her posse, The Dragoons, after which they named the movie. 

When Griff Bonnell (Barry Sullivan) arrives in town, he plants the seed of her demise. And when Jessica's brother, Brockie Drummond, shoots US Marshal John Chisholm in cold blood, it's only a matter of time.

I'm so conflicted about this movie! Besides Stanwyck's performance, there's little else to hold on to. Westerns don't capture me unless they are experimenting with genre.

We're the only ones being played with here. We barely see the forty guns or Stanwyck as much as we should. The plot sort of clumps together, like a Frankenstein of tropes.

The black and white Cinemascope is clunky as it tries to navigate tighter spaces. Despite that, the landscapes are breathtaking. The opening shot of the Dragoons overtaking the wagon is so triumphant.

<blockquote><i>Hollywood, California — city of contrasts! Home to the rich and powerful yet so popular with the broken and destitute. Here sex hunger is reflected in every aspect of daily life, and instant gratification is tirelessly pursued. A center of casual violence and capricious harassment, where rampant vice and amorality permeate every strata of society, and the barrier between food and sex has totally dissolved. It is a known fact that prolonged exposure to just such a psychopathic environment will eventually warp even the most normal and decent among us. This then is the story of Hollywood today. Not a pretty story, but presented here exactly as it happened.</i></blockquote>

With this monologue, matched with cuts of mailmen murdered by teens and diner patrons adorning root beer floats with ketchup, the movie begins.

Paul Bland (Paul Bartel) works at a convenience store, trying to function as a sommelier to customers of a less refined taste. Paul's boss fires him for telling a customer not to purchase a wine Paul didn't like.

Mary Bland (Mary Woronov) is a hospital nurse, dolled up for patient titillation, using vague promises of sexual favors to get them to obey.

Mary and Paul dream of opening a restaurant, but rent increases, and rampant swingers keep them down.

When a swinger tries to rape Mary, Paul kills him with a cast-iron skillet.

<blockquote><i>— Honey, I just killed a man.
— He used to be a man. Now, he's just a bag of garbage.</i></blockquote>

They take the swinger's money and realize they have a moneymaking operation — pretend to be a sex worker, kill the john, and take their cash.

Expert con man Raoul catches on to the grift and offers to help them get rid of the bodies for a cut. Little do they know that he's selling the dead clientele's cars and their cadavers to a dog food company.

Raoul also reawakens Mary's libido, starting an affair that is obvious to Paul before it is to Mary. Paul works with a dominatrix he met to push Raoul out of the picture. Easier said than done.

Paul Bartel could see the writing on the wall. That sex in movies was becoming almost blandly commonplace. That exploitation had been adding a little violence to their sex to keep people's attention. Here, it both criticizes and partakes in the practice. It gives us oddballs, Paul and Mary, whose lack of sexuality is their most disarming feature.

The whimsical and leading soundtrack undercuts the humor. The film doesn't trust the audience to know when they're joking. The music cues disappear as the movie continues. Perhaps they're only there initially to get people on board.

The movie's destination is obvious. I only wish it got there sooner. The movie's punchline is not as ferocious as the lead-up would suggest.

The film opens with an interview with Maggie Cheung, looking at black and white photos of Ruan Lingyu and reflecting on Ruan Lingyu’s legacy as an icon.

We then transition to the story, where Maggie Cheung portrays Ruan Lingyu, the “Chinese Garbo.” We follow Ruan from when she was 16 and an up-and-coming actress to her tragic suicide eight years later.

This biopic stands out by emphasizing the small moments of humanity, unlike others in its genre. It doesn’t avoid the hard truths, nor does it grovel in them.

The film’s lighting takes on the qualities of old films, giving sharp contrasts reserved for black-and-white movies.

Similar to <i>Irma Vep</i>, the film operates on a meta-textual level.

The film interpolates interviews with people who knew Ruan, scenes in which Cheung portrays Ruan, and scenes from Ruan’s movies.

We also watch the fictional filmmakers recreate scenes from the movies, including films no longer available.

The movie also moves into those scenes, further blurring the lines between fiction and reality.

We don’t know the line between the truth and fiction. Because Ruan Lingyu is dead, only the witnesses can speak on her behalf, altering the stories according to their memories and desires. We now know that someone forged her suicide notes, leaving everything to speculation.

This film contains some of the most beautiful scenes I’ve seen.

Maggie Cheung is incredible! Her performance broke my heart.

The military intercepts the project and assigns a man to conduct independent research with the interface.

When Dr. Reynolds has a heart attack, she uses what little power she has to wear the interface and record her death. Michael tries to rewatch it, but a military spy dies while tapping the encounter.

Michael persists in trying to watch the recording because he saw it continued after Dr. Reynolds' death. Michael can be the first to experience death and survive. The military, though, won't let Michael through without a fight.

The movie conveys the switch from reality to the hyperreality of the interface by switching between 35mm and 70mm film. The director uses the 70mm film for the scenes inside the interface, wanting the experience to be more real than real. I found it obnoxious.

There's a contagious optimism at the heart of the movie. It's encouraging to witness scientists challenging the military-industrial complex and developing technology that fosters deeper human connections.

As a film, this has multiple problems. The structure itself is a mess. The cast is great, but they mostly make blank stares throughout the movie.

A police spotter plane flies over the New Mexico desert. They spot a kid walking the desert, catatonic, her baby doll's head bashed in. The police take her to a nearby trailer, hoping to find helpful information.

The trailer is in shambles — walls torn asunder, blood-stained clothes, and sugar cubes.

Police find prints, but they are unidentifiable. The wind carries a high-pitched sound that causes the girl to become alert. No one notices as the wind dies and she reverts.

Someone (or something) has vandalized Gramps Johnson's general store as well. Gramps's shotgun lay on the floor, nearly torn in half. They find the cash register is full of cash, and a barrel of sugar is overturned. 

They find Gramps, his body, lying dead and pulverized in the storeroom basement. A later autopsy shows that, besides a brutal beating, his body also contained ""enough formic acid… to kill 20 men.""

The winds pick up, and a sandstorm overtakes the store. Gunshots — the sound of stridulation — the wind overtakes Officer Ed Blackburn's screams.

<blockquote><i>Lots of evidence. Loads of clues. But nothing adds up.</i></blockquote>

The police share evidence with the FBI and the Department of Environmental Resources, and they send out an expert myrmecologist. The scientist, Dr. Harold Medford, claims to recognize the prints. Before he can tell the others his theory, the proof crests over the hills behind them — a giant radioactive ant.

I love the combining of the detective story with the sci-fi direction. The collecting of clues makes the journey up to the reveal thrilling. We know where the movie is going — we've seen the poster. Watching them try to figure it out is a pleasure — a rare achievement in the genre (at least compared to all the MST3K episodes I've watched).

The giant ants look great! The initial shot of it coming over the ridge made my eyes widen. While their movement is a little fake, their design is spot-on. They watch footage of different ant species to educate themselves on the issue, and the giant ants look remarkably similar. The poster uses cat eyes to make them look more menacing.

Thematically, the events of the movie suggest some apocalyptic connotations. The giant beasts of the earth will overtake humans, signifying the biblical Armageddon.

The movie loses me a bit in the third act as it takes the Kaiju approach of the military intervening in the situation. Seeing the ants in the city makes up for it.

A semi-fictionalized conversation between real-life friends, Wallace Shawn and André Gregory. 

Conceived initially as a biography, they took advantage of the opportunity to bring their notions of theater to the screen.

Within the movie, Shawn and Gregory met through the theater. Gregory then disappeared for several years.

This dinner engagement is him resurfacing.

The film finds its footing as Andre questions his life choices, and how he spent his life as an ""intellectual creep."" That is the point where Wallace and Andre lament their phony culture. The conversation transitions to a discussion on how to live earnestly.

Andre says he feels like a Jew in a concentration camp living in New York, but he doesn't know where to go. To ""wake up,"" he believes you have to have extreme experiences.

Wallace views the world as his enemy, longing for a quiet existence. Can't a theater or a novel awaken the sleeping world? Is it impossible for them to enjoy life's small pleasures?

<blockquote><i>I actually had a purpose as I was writing this: I wanted to destroy that guy that I played, to the extent that there was any of me there. I wanted to kill that side of myself by making the film because that guy is totally motivated by fear.</i> — Wallace Shawn</blockquote>

The movie's pacing is wacky. The plot doesn't start developing until an hour into the movie. We spend most of the runtime watching X and Sandii fuck each other in different locations or Sandii performing karaoke. The story hints that more interesting events are happening elsewhere.

Everyone gives solid performances with what little they have to work with. Fox and X are not compelling characters to watch, though. They're just two rich dudes plotting and fucking for most of the movie.

A disheveled man walks through the desert, collapsing on the sand. He has a deformed face, and his veins bulge out of his skin.

The sheriff calls Dr. Hastings to diagnose what happened to a dead body. Dr. Hastings thinks it's biologist Eric Jacobs, but he isn't sure. Professor Deemer arrives and verifies that it is his friend and partner of 30 years, Eric Jacobs.

Deemer claims it is acromegalia — a disorder where excessive growth hormones cause parts of the body to grow beyond their typical size.

The problem? Acromegalia takes years to develop, and Eric appeared fine to everyone just last week.

At Deemer's lab, he prepares an injection to give to a white rat. As we survey the lab, we see animals far beyond their typical sizes — a guinea pig, a rat, and a tarantula.

Another of Deemer's assistants, also suffering from acromegalia, attacks Deemer. He destroys the lab, accidentally letting the tarantula escape.

Dr Hastings drives newcomer Stephanie Clayton to Deemer's lab. She is to be his assistant.

Deemer explains to Hastings and Clayton his synthetic nutrients to grow larger animals to feed an ever-growing population.

As time passes, we get occasional glimpses of the tarantula. Each time, it has grown bigger.

Soon, the sheriff receives reports of cattle being stripped to the bone and puddles of unidentifiable white paste.

Molly wakes up next to her girlfriend. They've been together for years, having a child. Their morning has that quiet routine of people who feel comfortable together and feel loved by one another.

Molly goes to the film studio to develop her pictures and put together slides. The photos are Nan Goldin's — she provided them for the film.

She then takes her bike to work — a brothel run out of a two-story apartment run by Lucy.

The other women arrive, getting ready for their shifts. They serve clientele between those serviced by street workers or high-end call girls. Middle-class sex work, more or less.

The film depicts a day in Molly's life. It highlights the physical labor of sex and the emotional labor of performance. They must be both assertive yet never bring the client's sexuality into question. 

Molly has worked at the brothel for two months. This makes her one of the new girls. She is still learning about some regulars and their fetishes.

We get brief glimpses into the women's personal lives. The difficulties of dating when your partner knows you do sex work or have a child at home with no one to watch them. These are not wealthy women. Some of them need other jobs along with this one, whether it's serving tables or dealing coke.

We also see the camaraderie of shared inside jokes or nicknames for regulars. We also see how easily severed that connection can be between you and someone else, and the clients keep picking someone else. Anyone who has worked in food service or any other part of the service industry will recognize a lot of common ground.

The film is not shy about its depiction of sex and nudity. It helps undercut any eroticism to reveal the hard work and performance required. Lizzy Borden herself called it ""anti-erotica."" The film, however, holds no judgment about the morality of sex work either.

The movie responds to Second Wave Feminism, in which pornography is violence and any sex is rape. The film argues against the ""female vs male gaze"" distinction. It lets the camera ""cut up"" the body to articulate the inner workings of the character's minds and experiences.

The film, however, doesn't hide that women made it. That juxtaposition is a flag. It is a way to signal consent to images otherwise scrutinized.

The jaunty soundtrack tinges every session, no matter how tame, with dread.

The script is brilliant in the way it characterizes everyone. It pieces together a world that feels real yet also maintains a pace and dynamic with the characters that it feels like a hangout comedy for stretches.

Ground control provides astronauts with the opportunity to speak to those at home. They give a little plug to the oil company that got them there.

That morning, Diane injects a drug into her superior, Karen's, water. At the airport, Karen is in a daze at bag check. Two men grab her, steal her keys, and put her in the trunk of her Audi TT.

Because of the situation with Karen, Volf puts Diane in charge of the negotiation. Diane reports this to a handler, who gives her instructions.

Diane, with her coworker, Hervé, seals the deal. Someone, however, has left the box of the drug she injected on her desk with a note saying, ""You forgot something.""

Rights in hand, Diane goes into negotiations with an American distributor called Demonlover, led by Elaine. 

Demonlover has one major competitor, Mangatronics. This deal would eliminate Mangatronics from the competition.

Diane learns Demonlover may be a front for an interactive, real-time torture site called Hellfire Club.

Elaine praises the site but claims no affiliation.

Diane's handler advises her to break in and steal data from Elaine's hotel room. Before she can finish, Elaine walks in and seals Diane's fate to spiral into the darkness.

The anxious Sonic Youth soundtrack gives a beautiful and unnerving tension to every moment of this movie.

The early 00s grays make every space feel dead and sterile, so the graphic content comes bleeding through, juxtaposed with the passive eyes of its audience.

In Irma Vep, Assayas asked what the future of French film holds. He investigates the impact of the internet on the proliferation of pornography and violence. Like Irma Vep, he does not answer any questions. And it is one that we are still learning the ramifications of. 

As someone who grew up during the Wild West days of the internet, I remember rotten.com, bestgore.com, and folks sharing 2 Girls 1 Cup like it was Keyboard Cat. Thankfully, I was a pussy by internet standards and avoided most of it. It's a rare positive aspect of my religious upbringing.

The corporatization of the internet has pushed this content to the recesses. It's still more accessible than ever. Installing passive content-blocking software can only accomplish so much.

12090 AD. A vampire hunter rides on horseback. A woman named Doris approaches him, bearing the kiss of the Noble.

Though Doris' village wishes to put her in a camp, the vampire hunter named D requests they fulfill his contract before taking any action.

D must face off against Count Magus Lee, his servants, and his legion of hilarious monsters.

I watched the 1993 re-dub to English since that's what I could find. I think it made the movie more enjoyable than it might have been. 80s anime had some squeaky voice actors.

I dig the Hammer film Gothic aesthetic. The movie has weirdly chill vibes for how violent it is. I suppose that aligns with Toyoo Ashida's goal of making a film for people who are tired from studying or working hard.","hooptober, hooptober9.0, anime",2023-11-13

This sequel has little connection to the original, except for the main character. The first provides additional backstory, but it isn't necessary to understand the movie.

While this movie still features elements of the original Gothic style in certain aspects, it is not as dominant throughout. 

This movie has more of a Western, post-apocalyptic vibe.

The improved animation style is right in my comfort zone. This came out while I started watching anime. The monster details are reminiscent of Tales from the Crypt comics.

Also, they lean more into D being permanently stoic, even when he's fighting, which is an anime trope I'm so tired of.

They go to the baron's castle in the last 30 minutes. It is bananas. Everything descends into bizarre dream logic, drawing on the inner desires and traumas of those who walk through the castle. If the movie played out entirely in that brooding style, I would love this movie.

The movie introduces bounty hunters and puts a price on vampire's heads. The bounty hunters are boring, and they get so much screen time. I'd prefer this be a short with the third act over any scenes with them.

I laughed every time the bounty hunters called for Kyle. A noble, illustrious name.","hooptober, hooptober9.0, anime",2023-11-13

The art made for the movie is cool! The paintings are sinister surrealistic works with shadows haunting men with knives. The movie also has some animated interstitials that are rad as hell.

The highlight of the movie is a scene with Roland at a dinner table during Carnivàle. I won't say anything else, but it's visually one of the most playful and entertaining sequences I've seen in a French movie from the era.

Dr. Phibes Clockwork Wizards start playing a jazz tune — animatronics programmed to play songs that haven't come out yet.

Dr. Phibes and his assistant, Vulnavia, cut a hole in a man's ceiling, lowering a birdcage covered in a black cloak.

The man startles awake. Along the walls, he catches brief glimpses of passing shadows. One bat lands on him — then two. These cute little guys are licking their lips like they are bloodthirsty.

The police find the man dead, his face rendered unrecognizable by bat bites. A surgeon whose death is reminiscent of an earlier murder in which bees stung a man to death in his library. That man was also a surgeon.

For each murder, Dr. Phibes places a bejeweled necklace with a Hebrew letter on a wax bust of the victim.

A fabergé frog mask, constricting and slowly suffocating a guy.

A machine draining a guy's blood.

All the deaths correlate to a plague visited upon Egypt in the Hebrew Bible.

The movie is full of indulgent decadence and 70s colors. Price's Phibes is a showman, each murder a performance like a magic trick.

The humor of the movie comes from the absurdity of the kills. For example, Dr. Phibes launches a brass unicorn head from a catapult to pierce a guy's heart. It's not a laugh riot but a fun showcase of silliness.

The movie's pacing is not consistently tight. I get a little antsy during the many music numbers. Still, I can appreciate the showmanship of it all.","hooptober, hooptober9.0, britsploitation",2023-11-14

<blockquote><i>Take off! What's she gonna do, kill herself?</i></blockquote>Paul is an office drone, training the temp. Work ends, and he goes home, despondent, waiting for any messages to come on his machine.

He goes out to the diner to read. Marcy tells him she loves the book, and they start up a conversation. She gives Paul her number, and Paul calls her when he gets home and she invites him over.

The evening goes downhill when his taxi drives too fast and all of his money flies out an open window. Paul's evening is just getting started.

Paul's surreal night in SoHo begins, where everything conspires against him  — a screaming papier mâché sculpture, an indiscernible burn victim, a 60s-inspired cocktail waitress, a punk club with specific entry rules, and a robber that people keep mistaking Paul for.

The cinematography is breakneck and smooth — it reminds me of <i>Bringing Out the Dead</i>, but less focused.

Paul sucks. He's self-involved and goes from zero to 100, blowing up on everyone for the littlest things. He might get some sympathy if he wasn't such a jackass.

Dr. Rosetta Stone (Tilda Swinton) wakes up. She puts her sick-as-hell Clamshell Mac iBook G3 in her bag. She runs off to a meeting with Prof. Crick to discuss SRAs — Self-Replicating Automatons. Dr Stone says they're only a theory, but we know otherwise.

I can only describe the vibe of this movie as ""made by someone who works in a college art department."" Jennifer Reeder heads will know what I mean.

Everything suggests that the movie's budget was tiny. But its <i>iCarly</i> web design is A E S T H E T I C. Ruby also drives a lime green Corbin Sparrow. I would give anything to have it.

Despite appearances, this movie is also pretty funny and intentionally so. It leans towards groan-worthy jokes, but my <i>MST3K</i>-loving ass enjoyed it.

The biggest problem I have with the movie is the script. Lynn Hershman-Leeson's dialogue and characters are so flat and clunky. The movie might be more successful with a little less earnestness. But then she would lose her message about love being love, AI or otherwise.

Martin boards a train and slips into the sleeper bathroom. He prepares an injection of narcotics and a razor blade. He sneaks back into the walkway and picks the lock to an overnight room.

In his imagination, a woman in lingerie stands ready to welcome him in her arms. He returns to reality. A woman wearing a sleep mask and bathrobe emerges from the bathroom. 

He injects her, begging her not to scream as he tries to hold her down.

<blockquote><i>— It's all right. I'm always very careful with the needles. It won't hurt you.
— What do you mean you're ALWAYS very careful?
— It won't hurt you. It's just to help you sleep. Don't you see? It's important to me!</i></blockquote>

After some time passes, she reluctantly drifts off to sleep. He strips her naked and gets naked, too, laying on her and trying to put her limp arms around him. He pulls her on top of him, takes his razor, and cuts her arm from wrist to elbow, drinking the blood that pours out.

He performs some cleanup and knocks over a bottle of sleeping pills, so it looks like suicide.

At his train stop, Martin meets Cuda, who guides and joins him on a second train. Cuda brings Martin into his house, calling him ""Nosferatu."" Martin has visions of Catholic prayers in Latin, exorcisms, and crosses. 

<blockquote><i>First, I will save your soul. Then I will destroy you.</i></blockquote>

Cuda dramatically pulls a blanket off a mirror. Martin's reflection glares at him. Martin tells Cuda that he is just his cousin, Martin. He removes the garlic from Cuda's door and touches Cuda's cross.

<blockquote><i>It isn't magic.</i></blockquote>

Martin will begin living with Cuda and Cuda's granddaughter, Christine. Christine believes Martin is mentally ill but not a vampire. She chastises Cuda's backward thinking for how it only reinforces Martin's issues.

Martin finds loving support from Christine, who doesn't know that he rapes and murders women.

He also gets support of a different kind from a radio DJ, whose show he calls to talk about being a vampire and ""the sexy stuff"" he does with women. The DJ calls him ""The Count"" and encourages him to live for himself.

Martin can shape his future based on who he runs to.

The movie shows a memory or fantasy through black and white film shot with arch Dutch angles. Sometimes, they are elaborate fantasies of playfully chasing a woman through a Gothic house. Other times, he sees mobs with torches and priests performing exorcisms on a younger Martin.

I don't believe the movie intends you to believe that Martin is a vampire. What he does is a sickness that reflects how humans deal with our inner demons. We give it names — we try to get rid of it through therapy or medication, but in some ways that darkness is a part of being human.

You can be a Cuda, living in fear of it, a Martin, creating a narrative around it, or you can interrogate it and integrate it into your sense of self.

We open with a video of men taking a pig from a barn. The pig screams out in fear as the farmer puts a captive bolt pistol to its head and kills it. The video rewinds to before the gunshot. It plays back the slaughtering in slow motion as the pig writhes on the ground, dying but not dead straight away.

Benny's mom tells him to watch TV, so he turns on a news story about football hooligans beating up immigrant asylum seekers.

Benny's room has a nice TV, Betamax player and camera, and racks of tapes. Rather than open the window, he has a live camera view of the outside. His affluent parents funded it all.

Benny goes to the video rental store and watches part of an exploitation flick. He checks out the tape and watches it as he falls asleep.

Benny's home alone for the weekend. He invites a girl he sees at the video store to his place. They experiment with his video camera for a bit. He rough-houses with her, putting her in a headlock.

He puts on the pig-killing video for her. Rewind. They watch again in slow motion.

He then shows her the captive bolt pistol he stole and loads it. He tells her to pull the trigger. She won't. He takes it from her. She jokingly tells him to pull the trigger. He does, into her stomach.

She screams and screams. He tells her to stop. She won't, so he keeps loading it and shooting her, murdering her.

His live camera catches it all.

He covers her body with the bloodied sheet and goes downstairs to have a yogurt. He does some doodles, watches TV, and cleans up the blood.

Benny gets naked and films himself as he smears some blood on himself. He films her body, being sure to pull down her rumpled skirt. He turns her over so he can see all of it. 

Benny lives his life acting as though nothing has happened, but the impact is showing in other ways — shaving his head and assaulting kids in class. 

He eventually shows the video to his parents. His father, realizing that the police will blame him and their reputations will be in shambles, works to cover it up while Benny's mother trembles. His father chastises his mother when she cries. He asks Benny:

<blockquote><i>— Are you scared?
— No.</i></blockquote>No one makes me feel more ill than Haneke, but for all the directors who do, his motivation is understandable. He is one of the few directors who incorporates darkness convincingly. He doesn't shoot violence in a heightened way — he looks at it with as sterile an eye as a kid doing homework. 

Benny talks about violence in movies, saying he watched a documentary about filmmaking and knows all the tricks and that it's fake. This is minutes before he takes the girl upstairs and murders her. We know it's fake — Benny told us so. But it is authentic in this world. The impact blurs the edges.

If it feels authentic to the viewer, then what is the difference?

We reflect on the contrast between children's brutal honesty and adults' indirectness.

Kyohei reminds me of my grandfather, who loves my aunt more than my dad. My dad took over my grandfather's business during a period when my grandfather couldn't work. He gave up his piloting career path. That won him some points.

In this way, families remain enigmas. We don't hear about our family history. We must listen for details and fill in the gaps. There are folks I see at Thanksgiving without knowing our relationship.

David Hemingson didn't leave out a single ounce of backstory in the script for Paul and Angus, padding this movie to a rough-going two hours and thirteen.

A house belonging to the Brubaker house, rundown and abandoned after a series of accidents, took out the entire family. The last member of the family committed suicide.

<blockquote><i>But remember, Bess — the Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away.</i></blockquote>

Bess asks the church to marry an outsider, someone who works on an oil rig named Jan. Though reluctant, they permit it.

Dodo, Bess’s sister, acknowledges the quickness of it all but expresses happiness for her. Dodo’s toast includes how big Bess's heart is and how Bess helped Dodo through Dodo’s husband’s death.

Bess regularly goes to church to pray. Bess prays out loud, providing the voice for herself and God, as though God was speaking directly through her. Her God chastises her for wanting, threatening to take away whatever she loves.

Jan must return to the oil rig, which devastates Bess. Bess knew, but she didn’t understand.

Dodo speaks with Jan, making explicit what the film has only hinted at. Bess is a person with mental illness and has had trouble processing absences since her brother’s death.

After an accident on the rig, Jan is seriously injured, but alive. The doctors recommend letting Jan die, as life will be too miserable for him. But Bess insists otherwise.

To Bess, this is how God answered her prayer for Jan’s return — that the answer must carry a heavy cost. She believes it is her fault.

Jan’s condition worsens. Dodo tells Bess to listen to Jan’s wants and to make life bearable for him. His request exceeds what most of us can handle. Bess tries to see it through.

Lars Von Trier did everything he could to reduce the character of Bess to someone so simple that she is capable of any whim his script demands. Emily Watson’s performance rises above to create a complicated and sympathetic human.

Lars Von Trier’s dedication to misery only works every so often. This time works because it answers its questions with a redemptive irony.

The police wrongly accuse Annie's brother Ethan of murdering the author of a book about the Candyman. Ethan claims it was the Candyman — the same claim he made about their father. Annie doesn't believe in the Candyman, so she summons him in front of her students to dispel their fears. Once the Candyman appears, he leads Annie down a path of trauma to a family secret that will tear them apart... literally!

The first Candyman movie explored how the black body is fetishized and subjected to suffering, turning historical pain into mythology.

This film carries the surface story forward, turning the themes into mere slasher fodder. Blackness in this movie only serves as a mirror for white lessons.

Candyman's given backstory is groan-worthy. The idea has potential. The way it comes together, though, takes away its power.

The movie has a high production value. The gore effects are impressive but end up repetitive and uncreative.

Phillip Glass' film score is the movie's most valuable aspect. It has a sharp blend of classic horror concepts and his signature textures.

Overall, the movie is an ineffective — bordering on offensive — sequel.

<b>Stray Thoughts</b>

* The cliché Kingfish radio personality sucks.
* Annie and the student standing in front of the window, her hands on his shoulders, his hand on hers — bad touch!

Pensioners march through the streets of Rome, protesting for increases in their pensions. Among the marching group are Umberto and his dog, Flike.

Umberto's rent is almost as much as his meager pension, forcing him to sell off belongings to make ends meet. He tries to sell his gold watch to one of the protesting men. The man slips away without an answer.

When he returns to his room, he finds his landlady lent it to a young couple. The landlady demands his total overdue rent by the end of the month, or she will evict him.

Umberto and Maria, the maid, are friendly. He asks her to check his throat, and she confirms a white coating. He goes to the hospital, leaving Flike in Maria's care.

When he gets home, his room is under renovation. The landlady let out Flike without letting Maria know.

Umberto does everything he can to find Flike. He thinks about ending his life, but not before ensuring someone cares for Flike.

De Sica improves his approach from Bicycle Thieves. He avoids sentimentality and lets the circumstances speak for themselves.

In less deft hands, this would be poverty porn, but De Sica speaks to real social problems in post-war Italy. 

He also injects the story with graceful humor to keep the story experience from being dour. Not laugh-out-loud moments, but slivers of brightness.

Umberto's story is not unrecognizable today. Capitalism is a brutal machine that consumes goodness and pride. Love can carry us, but is it enough?

The film is full of tiny details — the spot on the wall where years of matches strike, the morning coffee, and the temperamental alarm clock.

<blockquote><i>Never seen a woman who was more a man. She thinks like one, acts like one. It sometimes makes me feel like I'm not.</i></blockquote>

Explosions on the ridge. Johnny Guitar (Sterling Hayden) sits on his horse, guitar on his back, looking down as though from heaven. He makes his way through the windstorm to an empty gambling parlor on the outskirts of Albuquerque. He has an appointment with Vienna (Joan Crawford).

Vienna strategically positioned her bar and casino for the upcoming railroad depot. The McIvers control the area's land and cattle. They know the value of her land and want it for themselves.

A crowd of people burst into the bar carrying a body. Led by Emma Small, they blame Vienna for the death of Emma's brother — that is, The Dancin' Kid and his gang, who frequent Vienna's bar. Emma resents Vienna because Emma and Vienna both fell for The Dancin' Kid, and he chose Vienna.

Vienna won't take that sort of blame idly. She draws her gun, saying she won't leave without a fight.

The Dancin' Kid and his crew burst in, laughing until they realize what's happening.

Ultimately, Johnny steps in and de-escalates the situation with a guitar.

McIvers gives Vienna 24 hours to close the bar and leave town.

During the town's funeral for Emma's brother, Vienna goes to the bank to withdraw all her savings. The Dancin' Kid and his gang hold the bank up, taking everything except Vienna's cash.

The Kid's gang runs to their secret hiding spot, leaving Vienna and Johnny Guitar to plot their next moves. Johnny can shoot, but he doesn't want to. He used to be gun-crazy, according to Vienna. Five years ago, they met and fell in love. Johnny paints a picture of them together again, that everything that happened between their past and now was a bad dream.

The town forms a posse led by Emma, still dressed in their funeral clothes. They go to the bar, finding it empty except for Vienna in a white gown playing Johnny Guitar on the piano. The bar's open back reveals a cliffside, heightening the drama of her performance. They tell her she has to choose a side — that she can't ride the fence any longer.

Like a true bisexual icon, she refuses to make a choice.

It's all dreams — blurry edges, exaggerated backdrops — voices reverberating against the mountains, banks held up with guns and promises, rangers gathering in matching suits like they're hitting marks for dance numbers, explosions like fireworks.

The timing has an almost musical quality to it. The TruColor is lavish — the dialogue is lyrical and indirect — a trait I've noticed in other Nicholas Ray movies.

This is a romantic melodrama set in the Western genre.

Emma is a fantastic villain — her motives make sense, as flawed as they are, and I'm infuriated by her choices. 

Vienna only wears a dress once. She typically opts for jeans and the most colorful button-up. I want all of them.

I love how the staging of the opening introduces characters through a curtain pull. Each character gets their fighting game pose.

A new couple tours the place, noticing the gun in the guard's holster.

In unit 1511, Dr. Hobbes strangles Annabelle to death. He takes off her clothes and cuts her open with a scalpel. Smoke bellows from her as he spreads open her abdomen and pours acid into it. He then uses the scalpel to slit his own throat.

Nick grunts in pain as his stomach convulses. His partner checks on him, and he denies any issues. He goes down to 1511 to find Annabelle on the table. He leaves disgusted, alerting no one.

Nick bleeds from the mouth, going into shock. He goes home for the day but vomits blood and something that crawls into the drain.

It's a parasite. One that Dr. Hobbes gave to Annabelle as an experiment for a parasite replacing a human organ. 

Through sexual intercourse, Annabelle gave it to Nick, as well as several other men in the building.

The parasite that Nick vomited into the drain jumps out of a washing machine, burrowing itself into a screaming woman.

Mia stands breathless, calling Katie on her cell, but she can't get through.

She approaches some girls dancing, including her former friend Keely. She headbutts one of them in the nose.

She spots a horse chained up in a parking lot. She tries to break it loose, but the owner chases her off with a baseball bat.

When she gets home, her mother, Joanne, shoves her and tells her that the police are looking for her because she broke a girl's nose.

She slips out, buys some cider, and takes it to an abandoned flat. There, she puts on music and puts together some hip-hop dance moves.

The following morning, Mia meets Joanne's new boyfriend, Connor. Mia can't help but ogle him.

Thus begins a few days with Mia, a 15-year-old living in social housing in Essex with her mom and her sister, Tyler.

Later that night, Joanne keeps Mia in Joanne's room during her party. She dozes off, so Connor carries her to her room. She awakens but pretends to sleep. He takes off her shoes and pants and puts her under a blanket.

As the family spends more time with Connor, Mia opts to do things that her mother and sister won't. For example, Connor jumped into the lake to go fishing with his bare hands. Mia joins him, and they catch a fish together. She cuts her foot in the river, and he offers to carry her to the car.

It's easy early on to read what he's doing as fatherly, but boundaries get murky, notably as Mia develops feelings for him. The way he looks at her isn't exactly innocent, either.

The movie is full of tiny details, some grim — she goes with a boy to a junkyard so he can find a Volvo part. While she's looking out, she looks into one car and sees a smashed windshield with blood and some hair.

It's also one where I predicted where it was going early on. A good script and genuine story maintain their power, regardless.

Katie Jarvis, who plays Mia, is so good. I can't believe the casting agent found her because Katie was arguing with her boyfriend.

They bottle and deliver it to a nearby high school.

It starts small, with kids drinking the bottled water. With the school's water turning rancid, the prom coordinator prepares the prom's party punch with the bottled water.

The movie's theme is ""revenge"" — when high school girls break up with their boyfriends, they only want revenge. That's the only way our protagonists believe they will have sex.

If you like gross-out humor, there's plenty. All the blood, puke, piss, puss, and cum your vulgar heart desires.

The narration and freeze frames are Scorsese-core without understanding their motivation.

The gore is over-the-top, reminiscent of McKay's work on Robot Chicken. It doesn't work for me. 

Nicholas Hoult looks like a haunted Victorian child, so Renfield is an appropriate role for him.

Turning Renfield into a bug-powered superhero is so uninteresting. The lack of consistency in Renfield's power is annoying.

The film relegates Awkwafina to the ""Ice Cube in SVU"" role — ""You're telling me you work for Dracula?"" Thankfully, some of her awful jokes from the trailer are absent in the movie.

She's the funniest part of this movie. She knows what movie she is in and how to deliver the jokes. They don't all work, but she hits more often than anyone else.

She never gets injured once in fighting alongside Renfield, making her theoretically more powerful than him.

Nicholas Cage as Dracula is amusing, but this was the wrong vehicle for him to play Dracula. He never goes full Cage, but he gets some Cage-isms in.

Fouke, Arkansas. A small town with a population of 350. By day, a typical small town. At night, a haunted landscape.

The film frames the narrative in a somewhat documentary format.

The movie effectively lays out the premise through interview and reenactment, during which the people of Fouke describe their run-ins with the “Fouke Monster.”

The monster is Bigfoot adjacent, especially with how his form cuts against the landscape.

Most Fouke Monster sightings occur around Boggy Creek, a swampy region that only experienced hunters and naturists can navigate.

The movie begins with a child running through the fields. He’s off to inform a landowner about a Fouke Monster sighting. The framing and pacing in this segment suggest a skilled cinematographer at work. Most 
of the cinematography is functional, although it has some small, beautiful moments. 

I’ve only seen the unofficial sequel, And the Legend Continues, on MST3K. I can’t believe Charles B. Pierce directed both.

Compared to Pierce’s The Town that Dreaded Sundown, this hits harder because it maintains its documentary style and doesn’t have Sundown’s exhausting cop humor.

The narrator is well-spoken instead of dialect-appropriate. It makes sense from a viewing standpoint but creates a disconnect in my mind.

In a small Japanese farming village, En gives birth to a daughter, Tomé. Chuji was proud to be the father, but the town gossip suggests that Tomé could be anyone's child.

As Tomé grows, En is distant and judgmental. Tomé learns about En's relationships with other men when she is six. So, she clings to Chuji. Because En and Chuji are unmarried, Tomé believes she is married to Chuji.

By the time Tomé is 24, she works in a silk mill. En lures Tomé back to the farm under the pretense that Chuji is dying. He isn't.

They need help to pay off a debt to the landowners and want Tomé to marry the landowner's son, Shunzo. Tomé refuses, and Shunzo rapes her, impregnating her.

Chuji beats up Shunzo, forcing Tomé back to the family, unable to return to Shunzo for money or support.

So, Tomé must leave her daughter, Nobuko, with Chuji and En to care for her while Tomé returns to work.

We continue to follow Tomé through various stages of her life, from impoverished work as a housemaid to running a brother as a maiden.

Though she tries to do good, life punishes her for it. It's only when she becomes conniving and self-serving that she can have any success in life.

Meanwhile, as Nobuko grows up, she aspires to own a farm and break the cycle of generational trauma that has broken the women in her family.

The filmmaking is sharp, almost at the cost of audience connection. The time jumps between when we meet Tomé brings us to a woman whose circumstances have changed her.

Whenever Tomé experiences an event that changes the trajectory of her life, the movie freezes, and the music turns disjointed and sharp, almost like a horror movie.

Joe and Willy ride a boat through the swamp. Someone (or something) is stealing fish from their traps.

An anthropology professor (director Joy N. Houck Jr.) explains the Fouke Monster. He discusses theories about the monster being a mutated bear or ape. According to him, nobody has reported any human attacks.

Back at the boat, furry arms reach up from the water and pull Willy underwater.

Rives and Pahoo, two of the professor's students, want permission to go south. They intend to prove the monster exists.

They go looking for Joe to get his story. The sheriff warns them against looking into it.

People fear ridicule and looking foolish. Rives and Pahoo claim that isn't their goal but they regularly lie to and manipulate folks to get out of them.

They finally encounter the monster after sleeping in a family's barn.

But then they meet some redheads and spend a fair chunk of the movie trying to seal the deal with them.

It's got a couple of okay scenes, and the third act is strong, but this movie is more interested in its flat main characters than the monster itself.

It's fun seeing a young (er) Dennis Fimple. Otherwise, this is a slow, dry monster flick.","amazon prime, hooptober, hooptober9.0, bigfoot, hicksploitation",2023-11-23

A man drives his two children into the outback for a picnic. While the girl puts out the blanket and food, the boy plays with a toy gun.

Pistol fire cracks against the rocks. The man shoots at his kids. The boy doesn't understand. He thinks Dad is playing with him. The girl grabs the boy, and they slip away. Their father takes gasoline to the car. He sets it on fire and kills himself.

The two kids wander the outback. The girl guides as she searches for a way back to civilization.

An aboriginal boy finds them and takes them under his wing. They don't know where he is taking them, but they know he can survive.

Alice Malone is Australian and said Nicolas Roeg, a British director, perfectly captures the Australian outback.

The photography is breathtaking. They captured several animals alongside the characters.

The landscape, the setting, and the rising sun — the details build a beautiful tableau.

Characteristic of Roeg, the movie doesn't shy away from animal viscera or human bodies.

The movie explores grand themes — life, death, sex.

The contrast between the white children's world and the aboriginal boy's world reveals unexpected disparities and commonalities.

The film captures moments on their journey where they find the failures of colonization — abandoned homes, closed mines, deserted towns. The white British way is incompatible with the outback.

The director's son, who plays the white boy, is cute and avoids becoming annoying.

Jenny Agutter is perfect as the British girl who assumes the world will help her. It benefits them as they go through the wilderness. Their experience refines and broadens her expectations.

I watched this with my dad and brother. I was uncertain how they would enjoy the movie.

They both liked it! We chatted about the meaning of different scenes and the movie's total meaning. My brother said he truly enjoyed it! He couldn't stop talking about it as he walked to his car.

A priest on horseback arrives at a gated prison. The prisoners beg for the priest to set them free. He is there for one prisoner: Viktor Frankenstein.

Viktor tells of Herr Paul Krempe's tutelage that fostered his scientific curiosity and probing into the unknown.

Alongside his tutor, they developed a method of bringing a dead dog back to life.

Viktor wishes to apply their results to a human body — not just bringing it back to life but reassembling it to be a perfect human specimen.

Paul is reluctant, but Viktor pushes forward. Paul tries to tell him how evil, how horrifying it all is.

Viktor's cousin Elizabeth comes to live with him. The two are to be married. Meanwhile, Viktor carries out a private affair with Justine, his maid.

Paul urges Elizabeth to leave.

However, the family arranged the marriage to grant her family financial stability.

The brain comes from a brilliant scientist, Professor Bernstein, who came to visit Frankenstein and befell a fatal accident.

An accident started by Frankenstein.

I enjoy Terrence Fisher's updates on the classic Universal horror stories. He knows we know them by heart and so makes them engaging again.

Adding Paul to the story is a mixed bag. Paul is such a strong foil that Frankenstein acts less on blind ambition than amoral arrogance. His intercessions result in redundant scenes that do little except take up time.

Christopher Lee's role is an odd choice. He leans more into the id-driven monster of the Universal film over the novel's intelligent beast.","max, hooptober, hooptober9.0, britsploitation",2023-11-24

<i>Heaven and Hell</i>
Two friends agree. If one of them dies, they tell the other about the afterlife. When one dies, he appears in a dream. He says sex isn't as big of a sin as they thought.

This story is my favorite for the religious vision and the stunning imagery that resembles classic religious paintings.


A loose adaptation of Boccaccio's allegory, the film takes the themes and morals of the original to criticize Italy's treatment of the lower class. I don't know the original stories, but the adaptations seem faithful on the surface.

The movie's motivation is provocation. The church makes saints of sinners, hiding away corruption to preserve their reputation. Deceptions and secret agreements keep the rich and powerful in standing.

The film also explores the disconnect between artistic ambition and the fruit of their labor. Art falls short of the dream. This aligns with Pasolini's later disappointment with this movie, which led to him disowning it.

Ruth has a devastating evening with Bob and his parents. Afterward, Bob lists his assets and his one liability: Ruth.

Ruth takes the list — the house, the family, the career, and his freedom — and plots to ruin all of them.

The movie explores internalized misogyny, looking at the luxuries afforded to white men. 

Unfortunately, the movie also takes an ""us-verses-them stance"" on conventionally attractive women and the women outside that narrow band.

Still, the movie has a message of autonomy and empowerment. Though, it is told through a dark and stark sense of humor.

Meryl Streep plays self-absorbed to perfection. Ed Begley Jr. is as scummy as I've ever seen him. The script doesn't ask Roseanne Barr to do too much. She nails the scorned woman, ascending through the flames of her carnage.

<i>Voodoo</i> **
A jazz band travels to the West Indies. The trumpeter notices that all the women wear voodoo jewelry. He tracks down a voodoo ritual and looks for a way to turn the music commercial. Though warned, he makes a mockery of the god and the music.

He watches the ritual in one scene. Every time it cuts back to him, another guy is in the shot, giving him a death stare. They keep doing it, so five men surround him before he notices. I don't know if it's supposed to be funny, but it is.

An art critic bashes every work in Eric Landor's gallery showcase. The gallery unveils a painting by a new artist. He loves the work, but the artist is a chimp, embarrassing him.

In retaliation, the critic runs over Landor with a car. The injury causes Landor to lose his painting hand. Landor kills himself. The hand Landor lost pursues the art critic.

This was a well-known late-night gimmick, bringing on an art critic to look at works by animals, letting them praise it before ""embarrassing"" them with the artist's revelation. Often, an art critic would say, ""Good art is good art, regardless of its origin.""

The Amicus anthology that started it all. Peter Cushing is perfect as the creepy Dr. Shreck. Christopher Lee is amusing as the insecure art critic.

Ben Mears returns to his hometown to write a story about the Marsten House, a creepy house on the hill that he always felt was inherently evil. He has a childhood memory of breaking into and seeing the ghost of Hubie Marsten.

Ben tries to rent the house but learns that Richard Straker has already bought it. Straker intends to open an antique shop with his business partner, Kurt Barlow.

Ben stays at a boarding house instead and meets Susan Norton. The two hit it off, though Susan seems to have a past. He also connects with an old teacher who helped foster his writing path.

One night, two men deliver a large crate to the Marsten House. The crate spooks one of them for how cold it feels and how it seems to move without them.

After, they host a Christmas party. Some celebrate good cheer, while others carry melancholic Christmas memories.

<i>Madrid 1937, Spanish Civil War</i>

Two clowns — a Funny Clown and a Sad Clown — perform a routine while an air raid occurs, keeping the kids laughing instead of being afraid. 

The Republican Militia walks in, demanding the circus workers fight for them against the fascist Nationalist rebellion.

<blockquote><i>A clown with a machete. You'll scare the shit out of them.</i></blockquote>

The Funny Clown slaughters dozens. The Nationalists capture him and send him to the Valley of the Fallen. His son, Javier, tries to free him, but Colonel Salcedo kills him.


<i>Madrid 1973</i>

Franco's Nationists won the war and, as of 1973, remained in power.

Javier has become a sad clown, following his father's wishes. His funny clown is Sergio, a violent and crude person he despises.

Javier falls for a trapezist named Natalia, but she is already involved with Sergio. Javier watches Sergio repeatedly beat up and verbally abuse Natalia, leaving her passed out and bloody in a diner.

Sergio is a passionate sex partner, leading to a ""hilarious"" misunderstanding where Javier overhears and thinks Sergio is beating her again.

Natalia doesn't care about loyalty and will hook up with Javier, even if it puts them in danger. She gets off on that.

What Natalia admires most about Javier is that he refuses to laugh at Sergio's gross jokes. Others are too afraid and laugh out of fear.

Sergio catches them at a carnival and hospitalizes Javier. In a vision, he sees his father's throat slit, sending him into a rage. Then, an angel appears, christening him an angel of death.

From here, the film is a gore fest as Javier mutilates his face into a permanent clown mask and goes on a killing spree.


<b>*** Half-Baked Interpretation / Spoilers ***</b>

Álex de la Iglesia is engaging with his country's complicated history. He makes the characters not just victims of their circumstances but representatives of the country's violent past.

Early in the film, the clowns entertain children. Humor and sadness coexisted. Once the Spanish Civil War began, the clown lost its innocence.

Later, as the clowns mutilate each other, they lose their distinctions, and both become too horrifying to entertain children. In one scene, Javier runs into a theater to see Raphael on screen, dressed as a clown, mourning the past that is lost. Crying, Javier realizes the same.

It also seems that neither Javier nor Sergio wanted to be clowns. Javier became a clown to fulfill his father's wishes. Sergio became one to hide his identity from the police. When Javier is driven to kill, ultimately, it is the image of his father that propels him forward.

Natalia is Spain, and Sergio is the Nationalist government — possessing and abusing her, fooling her into believing that he has what she wants. Javier's earnest charm wins her over initially, but as Sergio continues to beat her, Javier becomes just another clown using violence to possess what he wants. When he dons the bishop's robe, perhaps he is the Catholic church, who became complicit with Franco's nationalism.

The Valley of the Fallen bookends the movie. It is the place where the Nationalists sent Republicans as slave labor to build it and the site that Javier and Sergio scale during the finale.

The site was also where they buried Franco. Years after this movie, the government exhumed his body and buried it in a municipal graveyard.

Eurydice comes to Rio de Janeiro during the Carnaval. Everyone dances around her. She takes the trolley through the city, seeing the festivities underway. Hermes shows her the way to her cousins.

Orfeu reluctantly marries Mira. Once he meets Eurydice, though, he feels a fire inside he cannot extinguish.

Death follows close behind, watching over the celebrations. He waits to take Eurydice away.

Orfeu promises to protect her. Can he keep that promise?

The criticisms from native Brazilians of exoticism and stereotypes portrayed are worth noting. In Brazil, people suggested I watch this movie and “City of God” the most. So, not everyone holds those criticisms.

Antônio Carlos Jobim and Luiz Bonfá’s Bossa Nova contributions are iconic and are no small contribution to the international spread of the genre.

Steve Shelley of Sonic Youth put this movie in their top 10 because of the music.

The movie is visually striking — elaborate costumes, colorful decor, and sweaty skin paint every scene with magic.

The simple plot could have led to this being a musical. It is, except they break out into dance instead of song. The waves of music are unending, keeping the party alive.

This isn’t a compelling story for me. It doesn’t have much plot development until the film has twenty minutes left. It has enjoyable moments throughout, especially the ending.","criterion channel, criterion, criterion challenge 2023, cc2023, palme d'or winner, 1001 movies",2023-11-28

An overcrowded and understaffed mental institution releases patients they consider able enough to reenter society.

The problem is that it's subjective, leaving vulnerable people homeless. Dr. Joan Gilmore, a newer doctor at the facility, fights these measures with rare success.

Worse still, the hospital accidentally releases Howard Johns instead of John Howard.

Howard is a minimum security patient. The computer classifies Johns as ""Paranoid and Dangerous"" and one previously held in maximum security.

Cut to Johns taking a sledgehammer to a shaggin wagon. He bashes in a man's face. A woman tries to run away. He throws an axe at her back, killing her. The axe throw is one of the few 3-D sequences in this 3-D movie.

Dr. Gilmore fights against bureaucracy and red tape to learn the truth. Gilmore discovers that most of Johns's murders occurred in a sorority house — the so-called Sorority Slaughter.

So, she does the most logical thing — she poses as a former sorority sister to gain entry.

Despite being procedural, the plot holds a few hidden secrets. It makes little sense by the end but waits long enough to twist into nonsense.

The blurry edges from the 3-D give many scenes a soap opera feel.

Belinda Montgomery and Viveca Lindfors are television royalty, and Katherine Kamhi was on several soaps, so their presence may also enforce that feeling.

The murders are pretty brutal! Some of the set pieces are tense, at least to a degree.

Gelsomina (Giulietta Masina) gathers branches on the beach. Her younger siblings say a man named Zampanò (Anthony Quinn) arrived. 

Zampanò informs everyone that Rosa, Gelsomina's sister, and his previous partner, died. He wants a replacement and will pay.

The mother accepts his offer and sells him Gelsomina, needing the money to feed her children.
<blockquote><i>— I told you, she's not like Rosa. But she's a good girl, poor thing. She'll do what she's told. She just came out a little strange.
— Of course, I can even train dogs.</i></blockquote>Gelsomina cries, not wanting to leave, but her mother begs. Also, singing and dancing like Rosa appeals to her.

Zampanò works as a strongman, binding himself with chains and breaking them. He follows the same routine, repeating his script and performance.

He tries to teach her to play the snare drum. She doesn't catch on immediately, so he whips her legs with a switch.

Gelsomina tries to talk to Zampanò. He is cagey and does not answer her questions directly.

Instead, he picks up a woman, abandoning Gelsomina on the streets overnight.

Gelsomina wanders through town, encountering The Fool's high-wire performance. He makes her eyes glow, and he can't help but smile back.

They join a circus where The Fool performs. The Fool challenges Zampanò, insulting Zampanò and disrupting his show, infuriating Zampanò.

Zampanò cannot escape the attention of Gelsomina or The Fool. He makes a choice that will change his life forever.

This movie is a morality tale that Fellini writes to himself. The main characters each represent a distinct part of himself, regardless of whether he loves or wants them within him. The movie explores the relentless journey of life. Sometimes it's a wedding. Other times it's a circus.

The Fool comes out of the tarot. He represents fresh starts. He has the mind of a child. Also, he signifies reckless abandon that gets him in trouble.

Gelsomina epitomizes love and humor. She brings light and joy to everyone. With that comes a disconnect from reality. Many interpretations categorize her as developmentally disabled, but I'm not sure about that.

Zampanò is a hardened realist, angry at the world and himself, self-destructive and violent. He is also a human being worthy of love.

Fellini shares the neorealist value of Franciscan compassion that extends to all living beings, regardless of their goodness or badness.

Gelsomina's love for Zampanò is not romantic but a compassionate one. She sees more than we know and knows Zampanò's capacity to change.

This movie bridges Fellini's neorealism period and his autobiographical period. The other neorealist filmmakers lambasted this movie for abandoning the social and ""reverting"" to the metaphorical.

The same lesson still applies. Life has room for all stories. Expansion and openness are some of the greatest gifts we can receive. Sometimes, we need a Gelsomina to remind us.

Jane Campion compared the movie to ""The Ancient Mariner"" and said, ""One cannot insult innocence without a lifetime of cost.""","criterion channel, criterion, criterion challenge 2023, cc2023, 1001 movies, sight and sound",2023-11-29

The doc opens with an interview with Stephen King. He talks about his fear of a troll grabbing him from under a bridge and how that evolved into a 1300-page novel.

This doc isn't about the novel. It's about the miniseries — the writer adapting it, the director reading it, and the long, disappointing road from the 10-episode proposal to the 2-episode snore fest.

The creators lament what could have been if the producers didn't restrict them. Considering the story, I think more time would have helped the second episode move beyond the info dump and have an actual plot.

All these directors do is make documentaries for die-hard fans.

Of all the movies ""prescribed"" to me to watch, I cannot think of a less interesting subject than a two-hour documentary about the 1990 miniseries It. Still, I found some of it interesting.

<blockquote><i>It's undeniably some kind of masterpiece. But what kind?</i> — Pauline Kael on <i>The Red Shoes</i></blockquote>
The doors at Covent Garden ache as people pound against it. The doors open, and the students rush in, ravenous in religious fervor.

Two audiences attend — one for the conductor, Professor Palmer, and another for the dancer Irina Boronskya. Neither group has heard of the other.

The music swells, locking in Julian Craster. He recognizes that melody. It's identical to a rhapsody that he wrote.

Also attending are Victoria Page and her aunt, Countess Isabel Neston. Victoria watches with binoculars, her red hair glowing in Technicolor.

Lady Neston invites Professor Palmer to an afterparty. Palmer invites Boris Lermontov, the company impresario.

Victoria and Lermontov meet at the party. She tells him she wants to be a dancer.
<blockquote><i>— Why do you want to dance?
— Why do you live?
— Well, I don't know exactly why, but… I must.
— That's my answer, too.</i></blockquote>
Craster writes to Lermontov regarding the plagiarism. He gets cold feet and goes to Lermontov's home to retrieve the letter. It's too late — Lermontov read it. He asks Craster to play for him. Impressed, Lermontov offers him a job as répétiteur.

Lermontov invites Victoria to a rehearsal at Ballet Lermontov. At the rehearsal, Irena breaks to announce her engagement to be married. Lermontov is furious.
<blockquote><i>You cannot have it both ways. The dancer who relies upon the doubtful comforts of human love will never be a great dancer. Never.</i></blockquote>
Lermontov sees Victoria perform Swan Lake for Ballet Rambert and offers her the lead in a new ballet, The Ballet of the Red Shoes, for which Craster will write the music.

Once Craster and Victoria meet, they butt heads. Lermontov preps Victoria through strict regimens.
<blockquote><i>And don't forget, a great impression of simplicity can only be achieved by great agony of body and spirit.</i></blockquote>
And then we get to watch seventeen minutes of uninterrupted ballet.

We see what Victoria imagines — herself in the shoes, jumping into them as they tie themselves, her dancing around the world.

The dancers can only perform the ballet on camera. It is an expressionist piece of filmmaking that does what is impossible on stage.

The ballet itself is a horror story. The cobbler's shoes have a dark magic that forces the wearer to dance until they die. 

At the peak, the cobbler gets replaced by Lermontov, then Craster — they force her to dance, but she also wants to.

It occurs during the movie's midpoint! It's not the climax — it's the frame and foreshadowing. The agony that comes with getting what you want. Giving us all the buildup invests us that much more.

The show is a massive hit. Victoria and Craster fall in love, and everything changes.

Lermontov is a creature of deep self-loathing — all his artistic endeavors are secondhand to the creators. Without it, what does he have?

The Archers, Powell & Pressburger, were time travelers, ushering in genre blends before anyone could pinpoint it.

When they say, ""every frame a painting,"" they are talking about this movie. I have never had more surprise chills from scene to scene. Every piece of filmmaking works together to produce something unseen before.

This is one of the greatest endings to one of the best movies I've seen. It's the best movie about dancing that I have seen.

Magic. Pure magic. I adore this movie.

Gertrud sits with her husband, confessing she no longer wants to be his wife. He loves his work, his power, and himself more than her.

<blockquote><i>The man I'm with must be completely mine. I must come before anything else. I don't want to be an occasional plaything.</i></blockquote>

She does not leave straight away. They have to go to a celebration honoring her ex, Gabriel, a renowned poet.

She says she is going to the opera but meets her new lover in the park, a young musician named Erland.

She tells Erland about a dream where she was naked, pursued by dogs.

<blockquote><i>Life is a long, long chain of dreams linked to one another.</i></blockquote>

Gabriel and Gertrud talk at the celebration. Gabriel reveals he went to a party. There, he met a young musician who bragged about his lovers, including his latest conquest, Gertrud.

The artifice breaks down. The cold staging of emotions gives way to real, uncontrollable emotions. Despite the emotional turmoil, the show must continue.

<blockquote><i>I believe in the pleasure of the flesh and the irreparable loneliness of the soul.</i></blockquote>

Gertrud sees a painting depicting a naked woman pursued by dogs.

Love feels like it should be eternal. We carry a sorrow at the thought of its absence. When it goes away, how long before we accept the next move? Which is simpler: experiencing fleeting bouts of love or seeking a profound, all-encompassing love again?

Perhaps let love be done and see what else life offers. How insignificant is that void when we no longer try to fill it?

When everything must be absolute, half-measures feel like violence. We all contain more than one person, and not one outlives love.

In his film, Dreyer focused on the importance of words over visuals. Misunderstandings in conversation drive the scenes, framed with slow images and small performances. 

Often, the actors direct their gaze towards an unseen audience. Gertrud seldom makes eye contact, always talking to the air.

Scorsese took inspiration from the contrast between the memories and reality. He wanted that same dichotomy in life vs. the fights in Raging Bull.

This last film by a beloved director presents a challenging experience. He suffered walk-outs and boos at major screenings, but those who stayed praised the movie.

While it's a good movie, I didn't feel a connection to it. I appreciate every technical aspect and thinking about its themes, but I didn't come away with strong feelings.","criterion channel, criterion, criterion challenge 2023, cc2023, 1001 movies, sight and sound",2023-12-02

Sebastian meets with HBO to pitch some shows, but all his pitches fall through. So he gives them Jordan's show pitch, and they love it.

Sebastian reluctantly agrees to let Jordan stay with him for a week to flesh out the project.

That's when things go nuts.

This movie takes forever to get started. After some convoluted plotting, we get to the real meat of the movie.

It explores Sebastián's suicidal ideation versus Jordan's vacuous social media presence and the influence those energies have on the world.

Perhaps authentic darkness is more meaningful than vapid brightness. It's not groundbreaking, but it works.

The performances are good, especially Jordan Firstman as a frenetic gay nightmare whose persistence keeps the movie progressing.

<blockquote><i>Sire, these lines are not a homage to brutality that the artist has invented but a hymn from the mouth of reality...</i></blockquote>

A child with spotty hair and a ruffed-up face, eating as quickly as he can manage. A line of women gives him food.

One woman takes him aside, removes her robe, and undresses him. She pulls him on top of her and makes him have sex with her.

Flash forward, and he's an adult nicknamed Sweetback for his sweet back.

The police want to question someone about a murder. Anyone, to make it look like the police are working.

They take Sweetback. He looks away while they beat a black man up. But he can't stand it. He takes his cuffs, turns them into knuckles, and bashes them bloody.

The film follows Sweetback's odyssey as he fights and fucks for safe passage through the streets.

<blockquote><i>— That's not him.
— So what?</i></blockquote>

A surreal collection of kaleidoscopic imagery. Images overlay each other, freeze, and start. The world turns pure black, and spotlights from nowhere highlight everyone.

Melvin Van Peebles had four goals in making this film.

He didn't want to cop out on his ideals.

He wanted it to have a high-quality production. He wanted it to look as good as ""anything the Man has ever done.""

""Entertainment-wise, I want it to be a motherfucker.""

He wanted it to be a living workshop — for the folks he helped continue to help others and not just themselves.

He wanted to make a movie where Black folks won. Turns out, others did as well. This started the wave of blaxploitation films, where white filmmakers trimmed off the edges to make something they could sell back to black folks.

This is a messy film. It didn't have an example to follow, so it became one.","criterion channel, criterion, criterion challenge 2023, cc2023, 1001 movies, blaxploitation",2023-12-03

This film is a poetic documentary that breaks silence to proclaim stories of black men loving black men in the face of anti-queer, anti-black America.

With segments of poetry, rap, snap demonstrations, and personal stories, it explores the intersection and marginalization of blackness and queerness.

The racism of whiteness, queer and straight, that not only excludes but hypersexualizes black bodies. 

It talks of the homophobia that engenders unrelenting violence.

The trans body, the body in drag, fetishized and hidden away, questions of passing versus the ability to exist.

The segment about vogueing is like <i>Paris is Burning,</i> except t feels like a view from the inside rather than an outsider looking in.

Or so the legend goes.

Cut to the present day. The news covers two recruits to be knighted, Ballister and Ambrosius. The people love Ambrosius because he is a direct descendant of Gloreth. Ballister is controversial for coming from a commoner background.

Also, Ballister and Ambrosius are in love.

Everything isn't peachy. When the queen knights Ballister, she hands him a sword. The sword turns into a gun of its own accord, killing the queen. Ambrosius cuts off Ballister's arm to stop the shooting. Ballister goes into hiding, with everyone (including Ambrosius) believing Ballister murdered the queen.

In hiding, a bloodthirsty girl named Nimona finds him to be his sidekick. She believes Ballister is a villain out to exact revenge. Ballister is on a mission to uncover the true villain.

Ballister gets caught, but Nimona easily breaks in and frees him. Nimona can change shape. So, she uses assorted animal forms to fight and escape.

Nimona doesn't accept categorization. She isn't a girl. She isn't a shapeshifter or a monster. She's Nimona.

The Director of the knight brigade used Ballister to prove that knights shouldn't come from a commoner's bloodline. Thankfully, the movie doesn't wait long for Ballister and Nimona to learn that.

Nimona believes the Director's deception is a smaller piece of a bigger problem with the system at large.

Ballister and Nimona also play a version of Monopoly designed after the kingdom.

The movie never says, ""Capitalism breeds the monsters it claims to fight."" but it puts all the pieces in place for the attentive movie-watcher to piece together.

The conflict is more nuanced than your standard animated film. It has room for sides and opinions to shift, maintaining story tension. 

Like a Marvel film, though, it exaggerates the villain's wickedness and simplifies everything for the finale.

I don't love the character design — the eyes are even bigger than the standard Disney size.

The world design is a blend of futuristic and medieval. It doesn't always fit together, but it works.

The film rules for having two gay main characters. The actual achievement, however, is letting them have conflict and learn from one another.

A kabuki theater opening, where a host introduces the story — a morality tale about how we treat older adults.

The curtains open as a song sets up the story. We begin in the mountains of Shineao, in a remote valley, a little-known village.

A messenger seeks Orin. He comes from her former village across the mountain. He tells of a recent widow, the same age as Tatsuhei, Orin’s son. Tatsuhei’s wife fell into a ravine and died.

Ubasute is a long-held tradition of the village. When someone turns 70, a family member must carry them to the mountains of Narayama, leaving them to die. Though harsh, it preserves what little resources the village has.

Now that Orin, age 69, has secured Tatsuhei’s future, he will carry her to Narayama at the beginning of the new year.

Not everyone follows the tradition. A man older than Orin refused to go to Narayama, and his family no longer fed him.

Kesakichi, Orin’s grandson, treats Orin like shit. Orin has a complete set of teeth. Kesakichi starts a rumor that her mouth is full of demon teeth. The teeth bring her shame, so she looks for ways to break them out of her mouth so she can go to Narayama with peace of mind.

The story follows Orin through autumn as she prepares for the journey. Then, we spend the remaining movie watching their emotional trek to Narayama as they try to arrive before the snow begins to fall.

Brutality like this can feel melodramatic. The grip of tradition, however, is a prevalent theme in the movie.

Despite all of this, Orin keeps a loving, giving spirit. For example, when the new wife comes to the village, and Orin has no teeth, she still cooks white rice, their once-a-year treat, to welcome her. It highlights the wisdom of old age that a community loses when they allow selfish greed to dictate their traditions.

The film uses sets and matte paintings to build out elaborate settings. Transitions are the sets coming apart, silhouetting, lighting changes, moving into scenes, past them into new scenes. The theatricality sustains the kabuki theater framing while still developing a convincing environment.

What makes this different is not the theater elements. It’s how far the filmmakers went to push the theater aesthetic.

The meta-textual qualities extend to the chanter telling the story, whom Tatsuhei interrupts at one point to question a rumor he sings about.

Shot in widescreen, the cinematography is gorgeous and intentional, reminiscent of Max Ophüls’s camera work. There are moments where the characters pause in consideration. The camera pans in a pivot around them. It has so much impact, and it’s such a slight gesture.

The film is full of rich reds and greens, reminiscent of Technicolor’s early color processing. The red skies at sunset, the green of dark rooms, the total red tone of the screen when Tatsuhei learns Orin has broken out her teeth.","criterion channel, criterion, criterion challenge 2023, cc2023",2023-12-04

Jason wins over Ali by being helpful, including telling them to scratch off the serials of their stolen bikes.

The stylistic flourishes are madcap. The director says this is intentional and to give the film more of Georgie’s perspective. I would buy it if the style choices were more consistent, but they feel more like a collection of flourishes they wanted to use.

For example, we cut to interviews with some adults and kids. It’s filmed in a 16mm style. We don’t encounter them in other contexts.

<i>Edo, May 13, 1630</i>

A disheveled man appears at the Iyi Clan’s gates. He was a retainer for the former Fukushima Clan in Hiroshima.

His name is Hanshiro Tsugumo.

After the fall of his clan, Tsugumo moved to Edo to seek a new occupation, but peaceful times made that difficult. Rather than live in poverty, he wishes to die honorably by harakiri and to use their forecourt.

The clan leader questions his motives. Another ronin with the same story and request arrived earlier this year. His name was Motome Chijiwa. Tsugumo doesn’t know him. According to the Iyi Clan, the man came to extort them.

The clan debated on what to do. The clans put Chijiwa through a rigamarole to determine his true motive. He would commit harakiri regardless of any offers if he wanted to atone. Through their questioning, they decide he did not intend to commit harakiri, so they force him to do it.

Worse, Chijiwa’s sword is bamboo, so it will not cut. He keeps stabbing, drawing blood. He has to fall onto the sword to get it into his stomach.

Tsugumo insists on carrying forward. He requests a specific retainer, but that retainer is out sick. Tsugumo insists he would like it to be him if possible. So, while they wait, Tsugumo tells them about himself.

As Tsugumo names more alternates, all alternates claim illness. 

The film calls into question what samurai honor entails and what of it is a mere facade.

The blood and makeup effects are effective, making for a grueling experience when anyone draws blood.

The movie is quiet and slow and progresses in logical jumps. While I appreciate the structure, it’s also dry and flat for most of its runtime.

Everything comes together in the last thirty minutes, and it stops being anime arguing. The cinematography is dramatic and stylish, with Dutch angles for days. I won’t say more and spoil it.

Each move contributes to the game's development. Is the story some alternate reality or something Céline and Julie concoct together? Does it matter?

Agathe is the most emotionally secure. She thinks she has Tomas, but Tomas is Tina Belcher at the Sadie Hawkins dance — he doesn't want to choose. Agathe knows she will disappear as long as Martin is in the picture.

The film is not a condemnation or endorsement of anyone's choices — it presents a particular relationship dynamic and watches how sex controls it.

Everyone is incredible in this! Their performances are complicated and understandable.

Today’s choice is <i>Somebody I Used to Know</i>, directed by Dave Franco and starring his more talented wife, Allison Brie. The two also wrote the script together! <b>#couplesgoals</b>

Allison Brie plays Ally, a documentarian turned showrunner for a reality show called Dessert Island. Once all the rave, the ratings have been tanking. After one more brutal interview where she makes a contestant cry, she gets a call saying they canceled the show.

To readjust, she returns to her hometown of Leavenworth, Washington — a totally kitschy Bavarian town that gets no feature beyond its name.

She hits up the local dive bar, and who walks in? It’s the one who got away, Sean (Jay Ellis). Really, she got away — they broke up when she pursued her career in LA, leaving Sean feeling abandoned.

For a guy who doesn’t know his birth parents, that’s a <b>#yikes</b>!

Still, the two spend some time together. Sean and Ally even kiss! When Ally tries to seal the deal and hit that, though, Sean is dodgy.

She does the sensible thing and tracks him down. When she gets to his place, his mom Jojo (Olga Merediz) is there! And the entire family! And Sean’s fiance, Cassidy (Kiersey Clemons)! Because this is a rehearsal dinner!

Jojo tries to wrangle Ally into being the videographer for the wedding. Her son, Jeremy (Haley Joel Osment), was going to do it, but Jojo thinks he’s too ___ to do it.

Ally sees an opportunity to weasel back into Sean's life.

Don’t think Cassidy isn’t onto Ally’s schemes. Since this is a rom-com, don’t expect them to talk it out like adults. It’s time to get <b>#bitchy</b>!

Ally is designed to be unlikeable, so film bros — you aren’t going to want to fuck her in this movie! Like a character written for a story, she has an arc, so if you stick around long enough, you might see her change. And if that’s not enough, you might get to see her <b>#boobs</b>. Honest!

Allison Brie and Jay Ellis have... what’s the opposite of chemistry? Jay Ellis has a beautiful smile and…

Danny Pudi and Allison Brie have chemistry. If Hollywood weren’t cowards, they would be the love interests.

Kiersey Clemons is great in this. She nails the tone. She also could have played the ex — she has chemistry with everyone.

Once the movie stops being cynical and touches its themes, it’s an enjoyable and thoughtful film.

Also wine helps! <b>#wineoclock</b>

Startled by the slamming door, Wanda wakes up on the couch, uncovering her face.

<blockquote><i>He's mad because I'm here.</i></blockquote>

Wanda borrows some money for the bus and rides to court.

At the courthouse, Wanda's husband, John, paces. Miss Godek looks after Wanda and John's two kids. John complains about Wanda and how lousy a wife she is.

When Wanda arrives, the judge asserts Wanda deserted her husband and children.

<blockquote><i>Listen, judge, if he wants a divorce, give it to him.</i></blockquote>

Wanda goes to pick up a paycheck at a garment factory, but they claim they've already paid her what they owe.

A guy buys her a Rolling Rock. They have sex, and he sneaks off, but she follows him. He forces her out of the car at an ice cream shop and drives off.

She goes to a movie and loses track of her purse. When she finds it, her cash is gone.

She slips into a closed bar, eats chips, and drinks a beer.

Mr. Dennis, who is behind the bar, is acting shady. He only let her leave after the police rolled by. They go to a closing diner, and he feeds her. Then they have sex.

He tells her to get dressed and get him food, handing her a wad of cash. When she returns, he smacks her and calls her stupid for getting burgers with onions.

<blockquote><i>What'd you do that for? That hurt.</i></blockquote>

They check out of the hotel, and he hot-wires a car. Wanda is confused, so Mr. Dennis hands her a newspaper. She has trouble reading, but the article about a bar robbery mentions them.

<blockquote><i>— Where's your husband?
— I guess he got himself a real good wife.</i></blockquote>

During Feminism's Second Wave, the movement made political choices regarding the women they wanted to support, and those they wanted to criticize. In Wanda's case, she was a slut who didn't deserve our time and attention — at least, according to Pauline Kael.

Wanda reminds me of my mom. She found comfort in the company of abusive men. Her naivete could be genuine or a performance for the men. If she acted nice, she thought, nothing bad would happen. It's a dynamic that was familiar, so she sought it out.

In that way, this film feels so real it hurts to watch. Apart from that, they have no similarities.

As the writer, director, and lead, Barbara Loden nailed an unrepresented person in media. Her performance is incredible and specific. With a single glance, her face reveals a wealth of information.

Now, it's hard not to see Wanda as a victim of her circumstances. It's bold for the movie to start with her divorce court session that she is late to. Otherwise, the character's sympathy would have been easier to earn.

I love how ugly and unromantic the crime aspects are. This movie isn't about sexy people. Wanda takes what she can get. Mr. Dennis wants more than the world offers.

This film is deft, unassuming, and so brilliantly pieced together. It's a genuine and singular movie that deserves all the praise.","criterion channel, criterion, criterion challenge 2023, cc2023, 1001 movies, sight and sound, films made by women set in rural areas, Heist",2023-12-08

Flashback to two weeks earlier, where neo-Nazi Dominick (Kevin James) walks the prison yards while Becky doodles on her test.

Her father, Jeff (Joel McHale), comes to pick her up. When they stop around a gas station, the news announces four inmates have escaped.

Jeff takes her to a vacation home for the weekend. He also invited his new girlfriend, Kayla (Amanda Brugel), and her son, Ty.

This news is unwelcome for Becky, who is still mourning her mother’s death. Worse still, Jeff tells Beck that he and Kayla are engaged.

Becky runs away to her childhood fort in the woods. Meanwhile, someone knocks on the door. Dominick and his three friends are there, claiming to have lost their dog.

The real reason they’re there is that Dominick stashed a key there. The trouble is, the key isn’t where he put it. It’s not like he was planning on letting them live, anyway.

What will Becky do?

Kevin James is trying to do a more serious role. When he says nothing, I believe he is his character. When he opens his mouth, I can’t help but laugh at his fake accent, especially as it falters by the end. While his cronies handle the physical work, Dominick mainly stands around and yells at Becky during most of the movie.

I’m happy to see Joel McHale. His character is not a great father, so it’s hard to parse whether that’s his acting or the direction he received. His character being named Jeff has, to my dismay, nothing to do with <i>Community</i>.

Lulu Wilson is the only actor who works in this movie. She leans hard into the teenage angst, but it takes that intensity to pull off what Becky does. The Louise Belcher pink hat also adds to the unhinged vibes.

You’re not watching this for the performances, though — it’s the gore. Good Lord, there is gore. The film is an R-rated <i>Home Alone</i> as Becky finds creative and bloody ways to fuck up all the nazis.

An unrelenting and hot day. Sweat and cheap perfume engulf the bus.

Rookie cop Murakami (Toshiro Mifune) feels his pocket.

Someone stole his gun.

The sergeant sends him to the Larceny department for some leads.

He meets Detective Sato (Takashi Shimura), whose experience and knowledge of perpetrators will help track down his gun.

Murakami chases a lead that Sato said is a dead end. Yielding to his persistence, she gives him a clue to find his gun. Still, she insists she had no part in it.

The two share a beer. The lead lies on her back.

<blockquote><i>Look how pretty that is. In the last 20 years, I've completely forgotten how wonderful the stars are.</i></blockquote>

Her tips take him to Tokyo's poorer regions. He sees the meager lives of those on the outskirts. How can the police protect them? What can finding his gun accomplish for them?

He tracks down a fence that handles guns but blows his cover. The fence cannot think straight as Murakami drags her into the sweltering interrogation room. He learns she was going to get his gun before he took her in. And that the thief used his weapon in a murder.

<blockquote><i>Bad luck either makes a man or destroys him. Are you gonna let it destroy you?</i></blockquote>

The pursuit in Kurosawa's film noir is both all-consuming and futile. Every step closer to the truth only blurs the facts.

Despite Sato's knowledge, his perspective remains rigid: a criminal is a criminal. As Murakami ventures into the darkness, though, he sees pieces of himself in the stories of the criminals they pursue.

This film is sharper and more refined than Kurosawa's previous crime film, Drunken Angel. The third act is lengthy and moralizing, though not excessively so. Regardless, it nails the landing.

She lives with an older woman named Elana, who picked her up when she was hitchhiking. Elana is a misanthrope like her, but she teaches her gratitude, which helps put her life in perspective.

The radio details a Proud Boys-adjacent group called the Noble Men, riding into Becky’s neck of the woods. After Becky “accidentally” spills coffee on one of them at the diner, they follow her home.

Fox the Speaking Head is a traveling carnival act in which a severed head speaks to the audience.

Inspector Braun walks onto the stage carrying an arrest warrant. Fox comes through the curtains and kisses Klaus, the ringleader, goodbye as they cart Klaus off to prison.

Fox buys a lottery ticket, the same as he does every week. He pulls off his shoe to grab the money, but the wind catches it. The teller laughs as another man steps on the cash, threatens Fox, and uses the money for beer.

A man cruises Fox, and Fox gets in his car. Fox calls him Uncle Max. They rip off a flower booth so Fox can get his lotto tickets.

Uncle Max takes Fox back to his place, pulling Fox into a world of wealth and cruelty. Fox won the lottery, half a million marks.

<blockquote><i>— He’s not the kind of guy that wealth makes rich.
— You can’t buy manners with money.
— Manners don’t fill the belly.</i></blockquote>Fox and Eugen, a friend of Max’s, start seeing each other. Though Fox repulses Eugen, he sticks around. Fox embarrasses him in a French restaurant for A) not knowing French and B) showing off some loud finger trick on the tables.

Eugen’s boyfriend doesn’t understand it, but Max gives him a knowing reassurance:

<blockquote><i>Of course I understand it. There are things between heaven and earth, my boy, that go far beyond what you could ever understand.</i></blockquote>Before Fassbinder’s epic <i>Berlin Alexanderplatz</i>, he played his own Franz Biberkopf — one of God’s fools who believe their life can turn around, that goodness is available to them, but that God has cursed to a comic tragedy.

Fassbinder has the perfect Biberkopf face — the clever smirk that every subtlety misses.

The child dreams about water. Throwing food in the water summons jellyfish to the surface. The dream evolves throughout the movie as his father appears. A giant wave threatens to take him.

The kid finds a creature in a box and carries it to the woods. The child believes it resembles a jellyfish.

He takes it to his class, keeping it in his backpack. But when he gets there, he sees several F.R.I.E.N.Ds running behind the teacher's back, all controlled by electronic devices. Some are aggressive, and the kids encourage them to fight. They disrupt the class, making it impossible for the kids to learn.

We learn the scientist is the child's uncle, and he warns the mother that the town is dangerous and that they must leave.

The cloaked men explain how they can harness children's negative energy to prevent natural disasters from occurring.

They collect that energy using F.R.I.E.N.Ds.

Murakami's art observes trans-cultural artifacts and highlights what gets lost in translation.

Westernization of Japanese culture and the assimilation of Western concepts from a Japanese viewpoint contribute to this phenomenon.

In this way, Murakami explores Japan's identity crisis, wherein traditional and cultural touchstones dissolve or reconstruct with Western ideologies in mind.

The surfaces of Murakami's works often (intentionally) obscure the intent behind mass market consumables.

The line between low-brow and high-brow is more amorphous in Japan than in Western culture. Manga is an art form the same way as a traditional woodblock painting.

In Jellyfish Eyes, these ideas come through the kawaii F.R.I.E.N.D, which has the surface appeal of a child's toy — in Japan, they also made collectibles of these creatures.

He also explores how the child relates to this creature and can contribute to its power in relationship to the child. Organic relationships yield better outcomes than those mediated by technology.

The film's overt themes can be grating and naïve. The film will also not permit a Western audience to understand it completely. More subtle themes are (intentionally) obscured through Japanese cultural references, creating a frustration that the critic assigns as a failure by the filmmaker.

And perhaps it is. Its themes, however, are consistent with Murakami's work and would have likely found more success if marketed through high-art Western channels. But that would be missing the point.

She arrives at a long line of women, learning that the family had weird, specific conditions. She tries to leave, but a van hits her, and they take her inside to tend to her scrapes.

Mbah Karso asks to see her. Every instinct tells her to leave, but she enters. She makes an irrevocable pact to work for her, cleaning the horrible lesions all over Mbah's body.

But her real task is to care for Mbah's granddaughter, Dela, who is cursed by dark magic. She will be free after 1000 days. When Sri comes on, it's day 995.

Sri witnesses Dela bite one of her coworkers on the hand. She tries to run, but some magic causes her to pass out. So, she is stuck until the five days are up.

The movie has a super slow start. The first forty-five minutes are setup and explained the rules.

Sri makes ridiculous choices given her circumstances. Her empathy makes her an easy mark for the demon. But maybe that's what Dela needs.

The finale is pretty fun and outrageous — I wish they did more of that


<b>***Spoiler Talk***</b>
If Sri going into the dream is what can save her, why didn't they try the day they found out she had the dream instead of waiting until the last day?

Also, it didn't seem like they had found anyone that could go into the dream like that, so what would they do do if none of the people they hired could do that?

Harold Lamb (Haroly Lloyd) is off to Tate University. He saved up by selling washing machines — a real go-getter. It hurt my brain to see the dates in his ledger say '24.

Harold reads a book of ""college yells"" to practice for football games. The interstitials are dynamic and electric — lightning bolds coming off the words. He attempts to copy what he learned from the movie <i>The College Hero</i>. He dresses just like the main character, Speedy, and does a jig whenever he greets anyone.

Of course, when he tries it out, other boys simply greet people, so he can't find a way in edge-wise. Also, older schoolmates see an easy mark and give him the runaround.

He meets the adoring Peggy (Jobyna Ralston), who knows that he's the butt of everyone's jokes but can't bring herself to burst his bubble. She defends his character and ""spunk"" when no one else will. The two actors have legit chemistry, so it makes sense they made seven movies together.

Lamb learns that if he wants to be the college hero, he needs to be on the football team. Despite appearing foolish initially, he taps into his unique abilities with Peggy's guidance.

Harold Lloyd may be the most idealist of the Big Three silent movie comedians, but he is also the most aware of the role that movies and media play on themselves.

This film is full of meta references to popular culture of the time. Harold Lloyd understood how we define ourselves by the stories we consume, including referencing Frank Merriwell, an obnoxious hero character who excelled at everything he did, all while maintaining humility. Sound familiar?

I also think Lloyd's style of humor has aged the best. The through-line from him to an Andy Sandberg type is clear — an idealist who makes a fool of himself, but when he finds himself, he inadvertently becomes the hero he wishes to emulate.

Of course, there is incredible physical humor.

The interstitial character introductions are all pretty funny, but my favorite might be, ""The coach — so tough, he shaves with a blowtorch.""

The scene with Lloyd trying to save the cat and hiding the kitten under his sweater is adorable.

The updated soundtrack is perfect. It's contemporary and fits every scene.

Annie gets a call that her mother is missing from her retirement home. They also called Annie's sister, Jenny (Sandra Oh), who she hasn't seen in 20 years. Mom ran away to Macao with her previously unknown boyfriend, Jeff.

Jenny is living out of her car and asks to live with Annie. Jenny realizes Annie knows everything on the quiz show and tells her to go on the show, but Annie is too shy.

Jenny decides to be a life coach. She secretly films Annie answering questions while watching the quiz show and posts it online. The video goes viral.

During World War I, Captain de Boëldieu (Pierre Fresnay) and Lieutenant Maréchal (Jean Gabin), two French pilots, go on a mission to rephotograph an area of enemy territory. Their current photo has a gray smear.

It could be nothing. It could be something dire.

Captain von Rauffenstein (Erich von Stroheim) of the Imperial German Army shoots down their plane and takes them prisoner. Rauffenstein invites them to have lunch with him and the other officers.  

Rauffenstein and Boëldieu both come from aristocratic backgrounds. The two discover they have mutual acquaintances from before the war.

Maréchal, who injured his arm during the crash, receives help in cutting his food from a German officer. The two officers bond over being mechanics.

The Germans take the French pilots to a POW camp. They treat the soldiers according to their rank but are still subject to German law and discipline. If anyone attempts to escape, they will be shot.

One POW, while washing Maréchal's feet, informs him of a tunnel they are digging in secret to escape. They've been working on it for months and expect to finish in a few weeks.

Maréchal believes the war will end before that. The POW isn't so sure.

They quickly learn that where they are digging the tunnel is heavily guarded and that the Germans killed someone who attempted to escape through there.

The men put on a vaudeville show. During the vaudeville show, Maréchal runs in to announce a French victory. The act gets him put in solitary confinement.

<blockquote><i>Out there, children play soldier. In here, soldiers play like children.</i></blockquote>

Before the men can make their escape, the Germans make them switch camps. The Germans send Boëldieu and Maréchal to a fortress camp under the supervision of Major Rauffenstein.

The grand illusion of the title could refer to their escape plan. Their escape might lead them to the front lines, where their efforts can secure victory in the war. War is perhaps the grandest illusion, with the false hope that it can accomplish anything, including ending all wars.

This film isn't the first anti-war picture, but the single most influential picture in the genre, as every meaningful war movie after it would aspire to its message of common brotherhood between humans far surpassing what war can accomplish.

Escape is always in the story's background, but circumstances prevent them from succeeding. Still, they try again and again, often off-screen. It is the common goal that unites the men.

Lieutenant Rosenthal (Marcel Dalio) is a Franco-Jewish character whom the others accept as French. He considers himself even more French since his family owns French farmland. He and Maréchal have a complicated relationship, and Maréchal brings up his Jewishness as a point of contention. But their relationship ends up being the most poignant.

While plotting their escape, the men feel disheartened at the idea of leaving Maréchal behind in solitary confinement. When Maréchal returns, they all embrace him, and Rosenthal cries as he prepares Maréchal food. It doesn't linger — it just lets you see what is happening and moves on.

<blockquote><i>You can't see borders. They're human creations. Nature couldn't care less.</i></blockquote>

A black officer attempts to speak to other officers, but they consistently ignore or barely acknowledge him. I'm not sure how intentional his presence is, but his scenes speak to how, even in prison, the others will not offer him brotherhood.

The vaudeville show is a delightful display of men embracing drag, at least by the other prisoners. The German soldiers look horrified.

This film is another one whose reputation made me worry it wouldn't hit me the way it has others. This picture is brilliant, nuanced, and enthralling, keeping me invested.","criterion channel, criterion, criterion challenge 2023, cc2023, sight and sound, claire denis req, 1001 movies",2023-12-13

We open on a blood-soaked, disfigured body. Squelching and ravenous growls take us to a monstrous figure eating another body. The figure chokes. It spits out a bird. In the air, we hear laughter.

Cut to a plantation-style home, where two children, Tala and Bayani, hide on the balcony. A Japanese car brings food to the house.

Antonio, a Filipino who helps the Japanese, interrogates the children's parents, Romualdo and Ligaya, about missing gold. Romualdo claims he knows nothing. He knows that if the Japanese find it, the family will be dead.

Romualdo leaves to find the Americans who may help them.

While the family prays to the Virgin Mary for Romualdo's safety, Ligaya gets sick.

The kids venture into the woods to search for their dad. They find a shack. Inside is a dead body covered in bugs.

Tala finds what looks like a cathedral with stained glass depicting a fairy.

A woman appears, adorned with a bright, flower-like crown. She resembles the Virgin Mary. Her voice doubles. Her mouth doesn't move when she speaks.

The woman affirms that her father is alive and will return. A bug like those in the shack lands on the woman's finger.

At night, the woman visits Tala. She brings a jar with one of the bugs.

<blockquote><i>This will cure [your mother]. But it might also make your mother its new home.</i></blockquote>

The film uses the fairy folklore to explore the effects of imperialism on the country. The United States occupied the Philippines during WWII. Like the United States, the fairy in this story created the problems they pledged to resolve. The fairy made their mother sick, and so offering a way to cure her that may also make its home in her body is a pretty direct parallel to US occupation.

Antonio joined the Japanese forces, tired of the American's empty promises.

The Guillermo Del Toro vibes are strong here, but I don't mind. We haven't seen Del Toro in this style since Pan's Labyrinth.

Felicity Kyle Napuli, who plays Tala, has a devastating role for a child to perform. She heightens her intensity without exaggerating. She does better than the adult actors.

<b>Italian Neorealism, but make it sexy.</b>

A man on the radio discusses the physically demanding and unvarying labor in rice farming. Women can only do this work.

Two officers pursue a jewel thief, Walter (Vittorio Gassman), at the train station. He evades long enough to meet with his accomplice, Francesa (Doris Dowling), and tells her to hide among the rice workers.

In the center of the women workers is Silvana (Silvana Mangano), who dances and chews gum. Walter tries to blend in by dancing with her, but the police spot him, and he runs off. Silvana notes she likes the way he dances.

Silvana sees Francesa is in cahoots with Walter and helps her get a job. But Silvana picks up on Francesa being a thief and turns on her.

The boss orders those without papers to go elsewhere, leaving Francesa and others hanging. Francesa suggests they go anyway, work twice as hard, and prove capable.

They all makeup songs — eventually, scabs cause the other women to cease work and fight. Silvana points out that Francesa is the leader of the scabs. All the women chase her down.

Silvana goes to Marco (Raf Vallone) to turn Francesa in, but Marco refuses to snitch.

<blockquote><i>— Shouldn't she go to prison?
— Prison was invented by people who have never been there.</i></blockquote>

The workers all decide to unify. Either they all work, or none of them work.

When Walter shows up, Francesa learns that the jewels she stole were fakes. This news gives her a sense of relief.

Walter plans a con to steal a large quantity of rice, pulling some petty thieves into his plan. Silvana is attracted to him, so he folds her into his plot. He doesn't tell Silvana the jewels are fake, so he uses them as a draw.

Giuseppe De Santis follows a trend that Fellini and other Italian directors would pick up — the mingling of neorealist concepts with more poetic visual motifs.

De Santis blends pulp and melodrama with a neorealist core.

The film centers on women and their labor. The mistake it makes is critiquing a specific type of femininity — the gum-chewing, boogie-woogie dancing women are the impulsive fools, particularly Silvana, who unwittingly becomes an accomplice.

Silvana is the product of capitalist ideals and is ""wrong."" The camera lingers and sensualizes Silvana, going beyond the story, and only serves lurid purposes. Silvana being sexy in the movie isn't an issue, but framing her while critiquing her is trying to have it both ways.

Silvana gets some redeeming lines. She works in the same rice fields as everyone else.

<blockquote><i>— Boogie-woogie, novels, cheap tabloids, that's all you know.
— Right, that's all I know with my feet in the water all day long.</i></blockquote>

The film briefly addresses the privileges given to conventionally attractive women but will not allow it significant focus because of the importance placed on prettiness.

My gripes aside, this film is still a well-shot, smartly-paced experience that helped push the next generation of Italian filmmakers forward.","criterion channel, criterion, criterion challenge 2023, cc2023",2023-12-14

The film follows the <i>Demeter</i>, the ship that carried Dracula across the sea.

Wagon after wagon winds the mountain, carrying wooden crates to the docks.

Captain Elliot (Liam Cunningham) and Quartermaster Wojchek (David Dastmalchian) pick their crew. Clemens (Corey Hawkins), a Cambridge-educated man, offers his science and astronomy experience.

The team assembles. One man, however, backs out of the trip, recognizing a crate's dragon emblem.

A crate overturns aboard the ship. Clemens inspects the contents but finds dirt. Then, hands emerge. A woman stretches out.

Clemens recognizes she has an infection and requires blood transfusions. He wants to disembark at the next port, but the client has offered a bonus wage for a direct trip. The crew wouldn't sacrifice that for her.

A Romanian crewman sees a face in the dark. Maggots litter the ground. Inside the ship, shadows race.

A crewman discovers the livestock is dead — their necks torn into.

The rats are gone — something scared them.

The woman awakes. Her name is Anna (Aisling Franciosi).

<blockquote><i>He is here. We need to get off this boat now.</i></blockquote>

Thematically, the film explores what we can know vs. what we experience. Clemons trusts books, while Elliot relies on personal experiences, some of which challenge the scientific knowledge of the day.

When Dracula appears, the sailors see him as some vengeful god. Clemens realizes because it feeds and bleeds, it can die.

Like most modern lighting, the filmmakers optimized this for expensive screens. I had to assume there was something on-screen when they first spotted Dracula.

Javier Botet, who played Dracula, went through four hours of prosthetics only for post-production to obscure it with mediocre CGI. The intricate prosthetics give him a bat-demon appearance, visible in some scenes. The CGI reduces him to a StarCraft cut scene.

When GCI doesn't obliterate a scene, the practical effects are top-notch. 

Aisling Franciosi pulls a <i>Nightengale</i> and totes a shotgun. She's my favorite part of the movie.

Corey Hawkins leads well. His personality isn't much beyond ""science,"" but he keeps it grounded.

Bear McCreary's soundtrack is appropriately generic.

<i>Bengal, 1910</i>

We center on the Roys, an impoverished family in a small village.

Durga gets in trouble for stealing fruit from Mrs. Mukherjee's orchard. Though Durga's mother, Sarbajaya, discourages it, Auntie Indir does not see the harm.

Indir also upsets Sarbajaya by taking food as she pleases from their food.

The birth of baby Apu brings a moment of unity to the family.

Harihar, Sarbajaya's husband, is a priest and does not bring in much money. Harihar aspires to be a poet and scholar. They hope Durga can find a good husband who will care for them. Meanwhile, he travels to the city in search of better job opportunities.

As Apu and Durga grow up, they become close and share moments of wonder — seeing folk theater or looking at pictures in a bioscope. At night, they listen to the sound of a passing train.

One day, they go far from home to fields cut with power lines and train tracks. They can see the passing train. Life moves on, even when they aren't home.

Nothing lasts forever, so appreciate the small joys, the moments of confusion and sadness, the brief seconds that remind you that another world exists outside your own.

The film has a rambling quality — time starts and stops, and some moments seem frozen while others jump out of nowhere. It circles its themes and plot points, hitting them at different stages of life and watching as they develop. Initially, the film may appear aimless. But the story builds collectively.

The film draws on neo-realistic ideas, focusing on a small cast and story. Though we see the difficult social conditions, the movie diverges in how it engages with Apu's imagination. Ray worked with Renoir on The River, so he applies those lessons here.

Though Indian film has been around as long as moving pictures, this was one film that brought India international attention.

While the film captures an authentic Bengali experience, it also conforms to more art house expectations — notably, excluding the popular song and dance in Indian cinema.

The soundtrack is perfect. Ravi Shankar's sitar transcends cultures and speaks with universal emotions.

This film, the third in the Yokai Monsters series, recalibrates after the silly and childlike Spook Warrior, leaning closer to the tone of 100 Monsters.

Still, none of the movies are alike. The monsters here are more sinister. They also opt for location shooting, adding to the sense of realism.

Instead, the filmmaker has attempted to recreate the world of a poet — the modulation of his soul, his passions, and his torments — broadly utilizing the symbolism and allegories of medieval Armenian troubadours.</i></blockquote>
On paper, this is a biopic about poet and troubadour (ashug) Sayat-Nova. In design, it is a series of moving, living paintings.

The color of pomegranate bleeding from the sheathe of a knife. A foot crushing a cluster of grapes. A child in child's pose, framed in stained glass, as a woman drapes blankets over them.

The child is our protagonist. The compositions are stages of his life reconstituted from the Armenian culture of the period.

<blockquote><i>I am the man whose life and soul are torment.</i></blockquote>Lines of poetry and song pair with the images. Not a narrative but another avenue into the poet's internal world.

Sofiko Chiaureli is a Tilda Swinton-type — their androgynous look transcends gender and readily imitates and elides it according to the scene's needs.

<blockquote><i>I desired a shroud for the dead body. Instead, they bared the frenzied contortions of their living bodies. Where then shall I seek selfless love?</i></blockquote>Director Sergei Parajanov's provocation is to ignore social realism in conveying a person who lived. Like <i>Andrei Rublev</i>, its poetic vision did not align with the rigid framework of Stalin. It was Tarkovsky's <i>Ivan's Childhood</i> that inspired Parajanov to make films in the first place.

This film could be the most beautiful-looking I've seen. I would love to play a video game in which each of the levels/worlds were these tableaux.

<b>This movie, however, is good.</b>

A depressed woman jumps from a bridge in London. A physically and emotionally scarred doctor named Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe) finds her body. When he discovers she is pregnant, he experiments. He removes the living baby's brain and puts it into the dead mother's skull. He names her Bella (Emma Stone)

An adult-sized infant is a handful, so Dr. Baxter (or God, as Bella lovingly calls him) invites an admiring student, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), to assist him and observe Bella's behavior.

Though God tries to confine Bella to the house, her advanced aging process and rapid understanding of the world (and her body) lead her to desire more than what the doctor can offer.

We follow Bella as she applies God's empirical approach to her life, arriving at an array of conclusions through an ever-expanding logic.

The film's visuals are reminiscent of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, with a healthy dose of Karel Zeman's <i>The Fabulous World of Jules Verne</i>. Everything has the hyper-saturated whimsy of seeing the world anew.

Emma Stone's performance is the best I've seen this year. Her trust in Yorgos Lanthimos to make space for and give respect to her performance pays off.

This movie is Lanthimos' most mature work. The film's philosophy explores cynicism amidst the world's cruelty. Here, he finds a more rounded, less jaded through-line.

My only major complaint is the runtime and pacing. The middle could have been tighter. While it doesn't ruin the movie, it prevents me from fully loving it.

The sharp wind cuts over snow-painted land. Gunshot sounds ricochet. A single figure emerges. Then dozens. Russian partisans traverse the tundra.

A German truck erupts over the horizon. Machine gun fire paints the trees.

The Russians retreat into the woods. A man shares seeds with everyone.

Women's and children's eyes meet the cameras. Their brows are stiff with ice, their face speckled with dirt and tears.

They must deliver everyone to safety. They must get rations.

The camera pans across the tree line — a mesmerizing pattern of bark and snow that obscures the group.

Two partisans — Sotnikov and Rybak — leave the group to seek supplies. We follow these men as they trek to a Belarusian village. When they arrive, they find themselves in German-occupied territory.

The film swings from kinetic and relentless to dense and reflective.

The black and white film is an aesthetic abstraction and a visual sharpening of the characters.

Handheld camera shots shiver alongside the partisans.

Distant cameras draw them as splotches marching along voids. Face close-ups detail inner turmoils.

The script is meticulous, with no variables except for the environment. Director Larisa Shepitko wanted to avoid any ambiguity to come through.

The score has incredible dissonance stings.

The result is bleak and human.

The actors look genuinely miserable in temperatures averaging 40 below.

The story asks a common wartime question — where is goodness? Does a martyr feed the soul or the worms? Does the conscience survive in the traitor's heart?

Sotnikov gazes at the sky, his head fading in and out of focus.

Rybak imagines running away and the Germans immediately gunning him down.

I expect the movie to have philosophical digressions when Anatoly Solonitsyn shows up. Or maybe I've only seen him in Tarkovsky movies. This movie doesn't disappoint there.

Vladimir Gostyukhon is an insomniac blend of Christian Slater and Harrison Ford.

Boris Plotnikov resembles every classical Russian painting of Jesus.

Rose is matter-of-fact, uncaring of her coworkers' emotions or child problems. She is not without ethics. She doesn't know how to navigate them sensitively.

Rose goes to the bar and, under the pretense of a handjob, collects a man's sperm and a blood sample.

Rose and Celie both having a medical background helps tremendously. They don't have to waste time explaining basic procedures, and their experience pairs well — Rose can handle the medical details, and Celie can perform the nursing routines for comatose patients. And when it comes down to it, they are both practical people.

Marin Ireland is so funny in this. She has a Herbert West intensity that drew me in.

Judy Reyes takes a wild premise and finds a human character. Her heart grounded this and warmed my heart.

The film explores the physical and psychological cost of motherhood and pregnancy.

The mistake the movie makes is the direction it takes with Lila. I won't spoil anything, but it mixes up what is otherwise a potent metaphor.

<blockquote><i>628 Belorussian villages were burnt to the ground with all their inhabitants</i></blockquote>In 1977, Larisa Shepitko directed <i>The Ascent</i> — one of the great poetic war films from the Soviet Union. That same year, her husband, Elem Klimov, began working on his final film, <i>Come and See</i> (then called <i>Kill Hilter</i>). During the eight years before <i>Come and See</i>’s release, he dealt with not just Soviet censorship but Shepitko’s death in 1979.

What makes this film worth talking about is not the content of this film — it is the story of its making. It is the landslide that it commenced, with the aid of perestroika, that exposed the Soviet Union’s stringent censorship, both in its art and in its manifest reality. This transparency (glasnost) was a significant platform for Gorbachev. With it came a loud wave of previously silenced voices.

The production of this film was grueling and dangerous. The use of live ammunition is insane. Detonating live bombs with limited protection is wild. The use of 14-year-old Aleksei Kravchenko, who had no film experience so he “could [not] have protected himself psychologically with his accumulated acting experience, technique, and skill,” is a bizarre cruelty. The filmmakers claim they hypnotized the kid. Not to help him but to “inject him with content, which he did not possess.”

And yet, it’s all effective. If the goal was to render the atrocities they experienced as realistically as they could manage, they did it.

This film isn’t a story of heroism, betrayal, morality, or ambiguity. It’s all chaos. Every moment left alive is an accident of circumstance. For every tragic moment, nothing can happen but witness it. By the time any partisans arrive, the village is engulfed in flames.

Of all the reasons to make a war movie, this one makes the most sense to me. The filmmakers witnessed these things, and few people knew about it. This film was their sole means of telling this story.","criterion channel, criterion, criterion challenge 2023, cc2023, 1001 movies, sight and sound",2023-12-18

She struggles to make ends meet while attending all the requisite meetings and classes so that the state will see her as a fit mother.

She is also in the third trimester of another pregnancy.

The film follows Gia through the last trimester — her work, her friendships, and what little visitation time she gets with her kids.

As Gia learns to open up a bit, she also gets help from Miss Carmen, who leads a group and helps mothers like Gia break out of the system designed to make people like her fail.

The movie moves like a gentle current, slowly shifting to each scene. We get long shots where emotions develop, and we watch Gia go through the millions of thoughts and feelings she has in this impossible time.

The color of the movie has a desaturated, almost vintage vibe. The result is perfect for the cast of predominantly black women.

Tia Nomore, who plays Gia, gives an amazing acting performance. Tia was pregnant during most of the filming, so the physicality was already there. Her natural and subtle performance is the reason this movie works.

Thematically, it looks at cycles of abuse and neglect — how children from broken homes came from mothers with broken homes, and so on. Add to that being a black woman, and the system is rooting against you, even when you're doing everything right.

Mr. Badii drives around Tehran, looking for someone to do a job. Several folks approach his car, eager to do labor for him, but he dismisses them.

Through the movie, we see Mr. Badii pick up three men: a Kurdish soldier, an Afghani seminary student, and an Azeri taxidermist. In a parable-like structure, the first two reject his offer for personal reasons. The third accepts, but not without speaking his mind.

To each, Mr. Badii shows a hole. The rules are simple: the person will return at 6 AM tomorrow. He calls out for Mr. Badii. If Mr. Badii replies, pull him out of the hole. If he doesn't, bury him. Regardless, he gets 200,000 tomans.

After watching Kiarostami's <i>Certified Copy</i>, I came to this film with a sense of his style. He enjoys obscuring and distancing the subjects, asking what drives the movie forward without a definitive answer.

The film has a saffron tint. West Asia used saffron as a dye and as a treatment for melancholy. As the sun sets, it loses its yellowness. It turns reddish hues mixed with yellow. The red flowers. The red berries on the tree.

When inside the car, the camera remains fixed on Homayoun Ershadi, who plays Mr. Badii.

When the camera moves outside, it lets the car go into the distance, watching it weave through the countryside.

It is a reminder that we can empathize with and understand Mr. Badii and his condition, but we cannot feel the pain he is experiencing.

When the film ends, we don't know Mr. Badii's choice. Because the movie is not concerned with his choice — it's yours. You are the person whose pain no one else knows. You are the one who hears these arguments for and against suicide. And you are the one who makes the choice.

The film concludes with behind-the-scenes camcorder footage of its production. Kiarostami gives us his taste of cherries — that which inspires him to keep living.","criterion channel, criterion challenge 2023, cc2023, palme d'or winner, 1001 movies, sight and sound, village voice",2023-12-19

That night, a ""dinosaur-like monster"" attacks the island. The mechanics ask Shikishima, the only trained fighter, to run to his plane and shoot at the monster. He gets to the plane but fears what could happen, so he runs and hides instead.

The following morning, he discovers all but one mechanic is dead. The mechanic blames Shikishima for letting this happen and not fulfilling his duty.

He returns home to Tokyo to learn that his parents, and countless others, are dead. He meets Noriko Ōishi, who is caring for a baby she rescued, named Akiko. They all bond together and become a chosen family.

Meanwhile, the USA performs nuclear tests at Bikini Atoll. The bombs' radiation affects the monster, which starts destroying naval ships. Shikishima, riddled with guilt, looks for any way he can help stop the creature that he believes would not be attacked if he had acted earlier.

This film is the most overt ""Godzilla is an atomic bomb"" metaphor of the Godzilla movies. Yes, he's always been that. It's hard to interpret it any other way when his heat ray explodes in a mushroom cloud.

The film also interrogates the Japanese tradition of ""honorable death,"" which traces back to Harakiri and extends through the kamikaze program.

Shikishima feels guilt throughout the movie for not performing his role, believing he should have died.

It argues pretty strongly in favor of honorable death. The counter it makes comes as a sort of afterthought, as they realize they don't need to follow the government's model.

The plot itself is coherent, which is rare for Godzilla movies. It's also trite and flat. I found it tough to connect with any of the emotional beats. I know I'm in the minority there, so I ascribe that to my tastes more than the movie itself.

The strength of this film is the Godzilla action. With focused set pieces, an audience member can follow what is happening beat-by-beat. <i>Jaws</i>' influence is clear in the intense water battles, the primary setting for most of the action.

Godzilla's design is very ""man-in-a-suit."" The legs and tail, however, are so hilariously thick that it somewhat offsets that.

Still, it is not until Natsuko wanders into the woods and goes missing that Mahito finds the bravery to enter the tower and bring her back.

Once inside, he learns… a lot of things that I found hard to follow.

The film is about grief. It's also about selflessness. And the older generation's duty to the next. It's also about idealism versus reality.

After a decade of waiting, Miyazaki accumulated a ton of thoughts for his film. Desperate for this to be his last film, he put everything he had to say in here. The film, consequently, is too long and lacks cohesion.

In terms of aesthetics, this matches Studio Ghibli's other works in beauty. Some character design choices seem random, perhaps because of the book's influence.

Găbița is pregnant. Her roommate, Otilia, has been helping her put together money and resources for Găbița to have an abortion.

Abortions are illegal in Romania, so they've found someone who will help them.

The problem is that Găbița got several of the details wrong. For one, she told the doctor she was three months along when it's closer to five. They prosecute an abortion at or after five months as murder.

The doctor will help, but the cost differs from what they expected.

Meanwhile, Otilia must handle her prying boyfriend Adi, who is making her come to his mother's birthday party that night. They argue over what would happen if she got pregnant. He either denies the possibility or says he would marry her. She doesn't want to raise his kids.

The film has several long takes, letting conversations unfold naturally. 

Anamaria Marinca, who plays Otilia, is brilliant here. Throughout the movie, she carries a heavy emotional burden while managing the details.

Although the film lacks explicit political discourse, we observe bureaucracy through background elements of the story, such as checking passes, IDs, and tickets. No moment feels private.

The character of Găbița is so frustrating — a good portion of the film's tension comes from her ignoring instructions or forgetting. But it's important to note that her pregnancy is never the issue. It's how she deals with the details and how it affects Otilia.

The most apparent theme is embracing the present and releasing attachments. You can't control when your hot water is off. When the kiln overheats, it can burn a sculpture's side. Busy people may not have time to answer the call.

At twenty minutes in, we get the opening credits after CW has abandoned Madison on a remote island to die — a great take on the Psycho structure.

Thematically, the movie explores the self-centeredness inherent to social media — how we can turn any experience into a story where we are the main characters. Madison believes this is her story. Then, it becomes CW's.

In the first act, we see CW's scheme from Madison's perspective. The second act portrays CW tricking another woman from CW's perspective.

But when Ryan shows up, the power dynamics shift again. The movie continually twists in small but believable ways.

The end feels a tad farfetched, but the film mentioned that Madison was a Girl Scout, so wilderness survival wasn't outside the realm of possibility. Ryan wanted to turn Madison into a social media influencer, further obscuring her story and reality.

<i>Boyhood</i> is a series of moments in the life of Mason Evans Jr. (Ellar Coltrane). He lives with his mom, Olivia (Patricia Arquette), and his sister, Samantha (Lorelei Linklater). He and Samantha sometimes spend time with their dad, Mason (Ethan Hawke), who spends much of the movie bouncing around.

The film is a technical marvel — an inspiring tale of independent cinema finding the freedom to make an experimental approach to a family movie.

This movie reached legendary status the second it came out. Its shimmer has faded over the years.

Time passes abruptly and bluntly. A song queue or a haircut change indicates passing time, which works for the thematic thread of the film.

Throughout the movie, we get the La Croix of a scene. The essence of an idea plays out, but we dip out before it gets any deeper — except for the ending, which Linklater wrote at the start of filming. We then ponder the meaning, the fleeting nature, and how life often happens to us rather than us controlling it.

It would have been impossible to make a good movie, let alone a great one, within this time frame. The script had to be flexible because of the unknown duration and upcoming trends. Antoine Doinel is probably the closest fictional character we have to Mason to revisit at various stages in life, and this is an exponential leap in technicalities.

This movie is pretty good. It's neither a disaster nor a masterpiece. The biggest mistake the filmmakers made was betting on Ellar Coltrane. He isn't a standout actor, so, as he ages, he becomes more boring to watch on-screen. They wanted Mason to have Ethan Hawke's ""ramble about anything"" charm, but it doesn't work — every impassioned speech feels rehearsed.

He's not the whole movie, though.

Patricia Arquette gets everything right from minute one. We watch her softness for her children grow hard-edged as life and love take more of her time and energy. We still see glimpses of younger her when she talks with Ethan Hawke, which is rare, so it's a sharp and subtle acting choice.

Ethan Hawke is Ethan Hawke in a Linklater movie — is he some version of himself, or is this what Linklater brings out of him? They take his character down a reformation path. We watch all the passion die and the bitterness settles in.

I wish the movie focused on Lorelei Linklater. She has charisma from moment one. She stands out even when she's older. They must have directed her to tone it down so she didn't overpower Mason.

My feelings about the movie might have changed if I was closer to Mason's age. Still, for all the similarities our lives shared, he doesn't feel like a person.

It's a great project idea and a fine movie. Get high and let it play in the background.

<b>Stray Thoughts</b>
* ""Yellow"" by Coldplay, immediately followed by ""Hate to Say I Told You So"" by the Hives, immediately followed by ""Anthem Part II"" by blink-182. Imagine if they kept that energy the entire movie?
* The music is classic rock when they hang out with their dad.
* Ethan Hawke wearing cowboy boots and putting them on the couch is psychopathic behavior.
* Mason plays Oregon Trail II on the iMac with the translucent teal casing. So jealous.
* Alcoholic step-dads with anger problems? Me too, kid.
* He went to a nice school — those Macs in his photo lab were what we had in college.
* Sheena looks like Patricia Arquette. I wonder how intentional that is.","criterion channel, criterion, criterion challenge 2023, cc2023, 1001 movies, coming-of-age",2023-12-21
2023-12-23,No One Will Save You,2023,https://boxd.it/5nbmPz,2.5,,"Brynn (Kaitlyn Dever) lives alone in a house on the outskirts. By all appearances, she is doing well.

When she waves to people in town, they don't wave back. When anyone calls the house, she picks it up and hangs it up before anyone can answer. Something has happened, and the town has socially exiled her.

She packs a picnic and puts it out at her mother's grave. She also writes letters to her former BFF Maude, saying it's been ten years since they've seen each other.

One night, all the power comes on in her house. Then it all shuts off.

Brynn wakes up and hears a sound. She tip-toed out of her room to the top of the stairs. She sees a shadow moving around in the kitchen. It's also making noises. Whatever it is, it isn't human.

The movie's gimmick is its minimal dialogue, with only a few lines spoken. That was a delightful surprise.

The first twenty minutes of this is top-notch. When the creature shows up in Brynn's house, they get incredible tension from sound and camera angles. My body tensed as she sprinted back to her room, the only sound being the creature's footsteps.

The film loses momentum after that. Although there are still themes and backstories, there isn't much story remaining.

Caught in an endless cat-and-mouse game, we don't know why it begins or ends. The creature's behavior is wildly inconsistent, so the established tension from earlier evaporates.

The fatal flaw lies in the movie's decision to wait until the last minute to reveal why the townspeople shunned her. I understand why — they needed a thread to keep you watching. Finding the best space to tell the story without dialogue is challenging, but it should have been earlier.

By the end, I didn't care because bigger things were happening. It would have added complexity to Brynn's character and connected to her interactions with the creatures.

The central theme is the most common metaphor of horror films these days: grief and processing trauma — which I have no problem with. But by denying our character depth, it undermines the theme. Some reviews argue that the film should have omitted the Maude storyline, which is reasonable given its underserved place.

Kaitlyn Dever shines in this. The movie spends most of its time looking at her, and she carries the film forward. The movie relies heavily on CGI, revealing the director's lack of direction beyond simple instructions like ""It's over there now!"" As a result, her responses sometimes don't match the scene's tone.

This movie also doesn't look like it had a big budget. The creature's CGI is okay, but the design lacks imagination.

I find the ending concept appealing. I'm unsure, however, if it fits well with this movie.

Like others, I agree that the film had potential as a short. As it is, it doesn't resonate with me.",hulu,2023-12-21

<b>A social satire fit for college sophomores and erotic regurgitation enthusiasts alike</b>

The triangle of sadness is the space between the eyebrows and the forehead. A panel asks the model to relax it.

We spend the first part of the movie getting to know the male model Carl and his girlfriend, Yaya, who is also a model and an influencer.

They give us the thesis statement of the film: ""Money and gender — am I right?""

As a male model, Carl makes less than Yaya. But Yaya wants to follow traditional gender roles and for her man to take care of her. Still, neither is in the relationship for love — the relationship suits their brand and grants them access to more stuff.

The second part of the movie is on a yacht full of ultra-rich assholes.

The crew jumps up and down, chanting, ""Money!"" while prepping for their clients. Their primary directive: never say ""no.""

One woman forces the entire staff to swim and ""seize the moment"" despite it forcing the chefs to abandon cooking food.

As a result, everyone who eats the fine dining food gets violently ill — puke and shit out the wazoo. It is gross stuff.

The movie's third part takes place on an island. The yacht has crashed, and only 7-8 passengers and crew people survive.

No one knows how to perform survival tasks except Abigail, a cleaning woman on the ship. Once she realizes that, she shifts the power dynamics and becomes the ""captain"" of the survivors.

The three parts only vaguely tie together, but the through-line is consistent enough.

The film's social critique — despite my joke subtitle, I honestly don't care today. The film has many successful set pieces and scenarios that play out. While the humor dips for me, it is still consistently funny and cringe-worthy (compliment).

Of all the 140-odd-minute movies I've watched this year, this film made the best use of its time.

A man makes his way up a steep dune, using a walking stick to help maintain balance. The sand is untouched beyond his footprints.

Curious, tense music follows him through the void of sand. The wind blows over the surface, creating phantom curls of sand. However calm his demeanor and actions, the music hints at some unknown danger.

He photographs a caterpillar and then puts it in a jar. A dragonfly. A sand cricket. He is a schoolteacher who collects bugs, specifically sand bugs.

He lay in the sand, dreaming — the specter of a woman's face cast against a dune. Then, a woman traversing the sand. A memory of a lover's quarrel.

The man missed the last bus leaving the remote village. So, the villagers invite him to stay the night with them. 

The village appears buried in sand, but the houses sit in deep pits to avoid harsh winds and erosion. 

He meets a widow who offers him a place and food. She asks him to stay beyond the night and help her.

He packs to leave, but the rope ladder is gone. He tries to scale the walls, but they break apart under his hands. The sand shifts beneath his feet as he tries to climb the steep dune. Every motion grants him only inches, lost in the next reach.

The ground shakes, and the walls crumble. The sand will bury the widow's house if she doesn't tend to it. It has happened to surrounding homes. It has trapped both of them, but she doesn't perceive it like that.

<blockquote><i>— Doesn't this all seem pointless to you? Are you shoveling sand to live or living to shovel sand? […] How can you stand being trapped like this?
— This is my home. […] Isn't it exhausting walking around aimlessly? If it weren't for the sand, no one would bother about me.</i></blockquote>

The longer he fights, the more work they must do to preserve the place. Sand becomes an ocean, the hut an island.

The film shows their battle against the sand and each other, shifting between passion and aggression.

The sand has a dark magic to it. Moisture travels within the dry terrain. Wood rots, and clothing decomposes.

The film does an excellent job of creating the sense of being trapped. The space becomes a surreal zone of images. Granules of sand embedded on sweaty skin. Sometimes, the viewer cannot tell what part of the body it is, so the body becomes an abstract sculpture. She wears a shirt resembling sand in the wind, echoing the surrounding landscape.

<blockquote><i>Even if it's a lie, it helps to have hope. That tomorrow it will be different.</i></blockquote>","criterion channel, criterion, criterion challenge 2023, cc2023, 1001 movies",2023-12-23

* 22 years of litigation hell over this movie, and 52 total with Kevin McClory. Literally every Bond movie up to this point was negatively affected in some way, but especially from the 70s onward when Kevin McClory sued for sole rights to SPECTRE and Blofeld. It wasn't until McClory's death in 2006 that Eon could make Casino Royale, and 2013 when the McClory estate sold the rights that Eon could make Spectre.

<blockquote>
<i>Countless people have sinned on their way towards death. Could the law even begin to punish them all? Some may slip through the law's net, but they cannot elude their own consequences. Religion dreams of a world where people are punished after death for sins unpunished during life. That world is Hell.</i>
</blockquote>Red skies, white ground, a green person bent down in mourning. They lift their hands and cry out. He then falls into a lake of hell.

Shiro and Tamura are cohorts in school. They attend a class about the concepts of hell from different religions. Shiro is engaged to the professor's daughter, Yukiko.

Shiro visits Yukiko and her parents when Tamura turns up, carrying a rose and a picture that horrifies the professor.

Tamura drives Shiro at night, talking about Shiro's future. He knows that Shiro and Yukiko are sleeping together and suggests that Yukiko is pregnant.

A drunk man staggers into the road, and Tamura hits him. He drives off, leaving the man bleeding and near death. The man is a yakuza and threatens revenge before dying. His mother witnesses the event and takes down Tamura's license plate number.

Guilt-stricken, Shiro confesses to Yukiko the hit-and-run. They grab a taxi, but the taxi driver turns into Tamura, driving into a light pole. The impact kills Yukiko.

After a night of mourning and debauchery in the city, Shiro visits his parent's retirement home to visit his ailing mother.

There, he learns of everyone's dark secrets and meets a woman who could be Yukiko's doppelgänger.

As people around him keep dying, Shiro feels closer to his inevitable fate — the fires of hell.

The plot gets knotty as twist after twist comes.

The final act of the movie takes place in hell, where we witness torments and tortures — people sawn in half, beheaded, skin ripped from their bodies, eyes gouged out, teeth bashed out of their mouths.

Tamura seems to follow Shiro everywhere, leading the viewer to wonder if Tamura is human.

The film uses the color red to signal doom. Also, several characters walk into scenes carrying a flower, almost like the flower is a physical manifestation of a secret that the character carries.

The film is weirdly horny at times, including an opening credit sequence decorated with pinup models. It has that Lynch horniness to it, where there's an unidentifiable creepiness at the edge.

Overall, the film is a little silly, and the hell sequence goes on a bit too long, but the visuals are exciting and deeply 60s, making this an enjoyable watch.","criterion channel, criterion, criterion challenge 2024, cc2024",2024-01-01

A group of samurai come out of the woods to a house. Inside lives a mother and daughter, who are alone after the daughter's husband went missing.

The men force them against the floor, eating their food and SAing them. When done, they set the house on fire.

When the fire settles, the women lay there, covered in burns. A black cat walks over their bodies. The cat licks at their cheeks and meows.

A samurai rides his horse, guarding Rajomon Gate.  A spectral figure leaps over the top of his head. He doesn't notice. A woman approaches all in white.

She asks him to walk her across the grove safely. She draws him into the bamboo forest, leaping over pools of water. The cat continues to mew.

Her house seems to exist both within the forest and separate from it, as though an invisible veil separates them. Her mother glides in carrying food. Her hair wags like a cat's tail.

The man, drunk on sake, kisses the daughter. Meanwhile, the mother performs a ritual. The daughter moves to his neck and tears at it, blood pouring. 

Samurais continue to guard the gate as the duo lures them to the home, seduce, and kill them. They have made a pact to drain the life of all samurai.

They are not prepared for when their daughter's husband comes back, now a samurai.

The pacing is deliberate — not slow, but letting each piece of the story unfold and settle.

Incredible lighting creates immense depth of space and odd geographies.

The sun appears like a painted backdrop, obliterating everything else.

The film calls into question the duplicity of samurai, who appear as symbols of courage while exploiting the peasants around them. How they ""enhanced"" stories to make them more pleasing to audiences.

The plot relies on the guy being exceptionally naive. A couple of times, it was annoying, but nothing horrendous.

<blockquote><i>— Sometimes, you scare me.

""Why did my dad die in that locked room? How is it, Shadwell, that you don't get any older? And what's the secret of the living dead?"" he asks while scarfing down a hoagie.

Tom demands to go into the locked room. When he enters, the door disappears. He has a frog pendant meant to keep him safe.

The mirror stops reflecting him and becomes a window. The mirror smokes, and a Frog God appears to him. He has a vision of his mother signing a pact with the Frog God. Then, the revelation — to come back from the dead, you must believe that you will return.

The Living Dead terrorizes the town, running from the fuzz before Tom rides off the bridge and dies.

The gang buries him at Seven Witches. Sure enough, he returns. And he's killing anyone who gets in his way.

Marcos works as a butcher in a slaughterhouse. The film opens with graphic footage of workers stringing up cows and draining their blood, bit by bit, into buckets. While this happens, Marcos stands outside eating a sandwich.

Marcos lives in a run-down house surrounded by high-rise apartment buildings. From one apartment, Nestor watches Marcos through his binoculars. In one scene, Nestor watches as Marcos masturbates to the pin-ups pinned to his wall.

Marcos's girlfriend, Paula, urges Marcos to be more ambitious and increase his income to escape his current life. She is significantly younger than him — a symbol of his masculinity. Though Marcos is content with his life, he wants to marry Paula. So, he promises to get a promotion.

Out late, Marcos and Paula grab a taxi home. The taxi driver becomes infuriated as the couple passionately kisses in the backseat. Marcos asks the driver if he's a homosexual. The driver pulls over and forces them out. Marcos refuses to pay, so the driver pushes over Marcos and goes to attack Paula. Enraged, Marcos grabs a rock and bashes the driver in the head.

<blockquote><i>Don't worry. You can only kill a person as easy as that in the movies.</i></blockquote>

The following day, the taxi driver's death was in the newspaper. Paula begs Marcos to go to the police and tell them everything.

<blockquote><i>Police will only listen to the rich. And a lawyer costs too much money.</i></blockquote>

Marcos tries to dissuade her. Eventually, she mocks him, saying he is content to live in squalor. This insult drives Marcos over the edge, and he strangles her to death.

Marcos calls on his brother, Steve, to help him with Paula's body, but Steve also insists that they go to the police. He's open to inventing a story. But he knows Marcos won't get away with it. Marcos bashes Steve's head with a wrench.

Carmen, Steve's fiancée, shows up looking for Steve.

Do you see a pattern?

The boss gives Marcos a promotion, telling him the factory ""is as much his as it is ours."" Marcos works a strange machine that takes animal meat as the input and processes it through unknown means. So, Marcos cuts the bodies into pieces, bringing bits in a gym bag to work, where he empties the bag into the machine, mixing human and cow meat.

Meanwhile, his coworkers resent him for getting a promotion, suggesting he'll soon live in one of those high-rise apartments.

Nestor creates ""chance"" encounters with Marcos. He hints at knowing more but remains tight-lipped. Nestor and Marcos grow closer as Nestor tries to provide a way out for Marcos.

The American title for this movie is misleading. Marcos is not a cannibal. In fact, at the diner he frequents, they give him a soup made from the meat at his factory. Once he learns that fact, he becomes nauseous and leaves — the only time we see him physically react to what he's done.

Director Eloy de la Iglesia was an openly gay socialist, and the film came out a few years before Franco's death. 

Though the Spanish censors rejected several versions of this film, the result is still a social critique.

The film examines the class disparities between workers, such as Marcos, and affluent individuals like Nestor.

When the two go out for a drink, the police check their IDs. Marcos quickly pulls his ID out, spilling his drink. Nestor tells them he left it in his high-rise apartment. The police soften towards Nestor and kindly request he remember it next time. This encounter reinforces Marcos' earlier lament about the police only helping the rich. 

As Marcos spends more time with Nestor, he questions why Nestor wants to help him. Nestor tells him that the rich solve their problems so easily, so he enjoys watching someone work at it.

The film also suggests a gay relationship between Marcos and Nestor. This relationship becomes more overt when Nestor invites Marcos to go night swimming, and the two playfully interact and share a shower afterward. An earlier film version included a scene with the two men kissing. Of course, the censors demanded that de la Iglesia remove it.

We can see the violent murders Marcos commits as repression manifesting as violence. While Nestor's wealth affords him the ability to be more open about his sexuality, Marcos has lived with a machismo mindset and doesn't see the possibility.

Also, Marcos becomes the slaughterhouse, killing with little regard for the consequences. As he eats a pastry, he ponders what to do with one body, mirroring the opening scene.

The murder scenes are visceral. They are likely why several countries banned this movie and why the UK put it on their Video Nasties list. But this film is closer to Pasolini than it is to Deodato.

While a flawed movie, this strange blend of slasher and art-house is surprising and more complex than its promotional material suggests.","shudder, hooptober, hooptober8.0, video nasties",2024-01-02

<i>Beverly Hills, 1968</i>

<blockquote><i>I don't fuck anybody for money. I do it for fun.</i></blockquote>George (Warren Beaty) is a Hollywood hairdresser who hates that he has people above him. He wants to open his hair salon.

George is fucking Felicia (Lee Grant).

George is dating Jill (Goldie Hawn), who doesn't know he fucks around.

Felicia's husband, Lester (Jack Warden), is fucking Jackie (Julie Christie), who is also George's ex — the only one he may have loved.

Are you keeping up?

George appeals to Lester to help bankroll his hair salon.

Lester thinks George is gay. Lester's daughter, Lorna (Carrie Fisher), knows better. So Lorna and George fuck.

Jill has a job offer from Johnny Pope (Tony Bill), who has feelings for Jill.

Lester asks George to take Jackie to a Republican soiree. Johnny Pope is going with Jill. Felicia, Lester's wife, shows up as well. Chaos ensues.

Warren Beaty plays a heightened version of himself — a sex-obsessed, anger-prone child that everyone wants to fuck. He doesn't know what he wants out of life. He thinks opening his hair salon will fix it, but he only wants to have more control over his life and access to more people to fuck.

Like many Robert Towne scripts, politics move around in the background, suggesting themes but not dominating the story. It has the smarmy confidence of the 70s that conservatism is dead. Where the film hits is its depiction of Republican ""concerns."" They live a rich, insulated life from the violence their politics embody, so they feel they are improving the world and looking after their bottom line.

<blockquote><i>I just wish I knew what the hell I'm living for.</i></blockquote>We don't see George develop as a character or learn anything. We see him admit to his proclivities, and he sees it as his right. 

<blockquote><i>Let's face it. I fucked them all. That's why I went to beauty school. They're always there, and I don't know why I'm apologizing… It makes me feel like I'm gonna live forever.</i></blockquote>Despite George's efforts to fix things, life progresses without him.

</b>
The film follows three men during different periods in Hungary's history

Morosgoványi Vendel is an orderly during WWII. He is painfully horny, relying on the heat of a candle to feel warmth or the chill of the icy water on his penis for some reason

His lieutenant, the homeowner, gives him an endless list of menial chores.

He also spies on the lieutenant's wife, Irma, and their two daughters, watching them bathe and shit.

His imagination takes over his reality as he imagines being a hero to a cold child or, more concretely, fucking Irma — in reality, he was fucking a butchered pig.

Somehow, this impregnates Irma, and she gives birth to a son, Balatony Kálmán

Kálmán grows up to be a speed eater during the Cold War. He performs for a crowd and the Soviet military, eating massive quantities of food. After they finish, all the men go to a pool where their trainers massage them while they puke in preparation for the next round.

Aczél Gizi, one of the other champions, cheers him on, and he decides that he will marry her. The two elope and have Balatony Lajoska

Lajoska grows up to be a taxidermist in modern-day Hungary. Kálmán has eaten himself into a sedentary existence in front of the TV, where he watches old eating competitions and trains his cats in eating.

Kálmán is embarrassed by Lajoska's thin frame, chastising him. But one day, Lajoska accidentally leaves the door to the cat cage open, and they eat Kálmán.

This movie has the most human viscera I've seen in a film, culminating in a scene where a guy taxidermies himself by surgically removing all his organs. We watch tissue and muscle cut into, and the camera lingers on the internals.

I'm sure the grotesque nature of the film is crucial to the socio-political critiques at the core of the movie. But I don't have much familiarity with Hungary's history beyond the broad strokes, so any analysis on my part would be shallow.

I can say that the film focuses on the body — its desires, its abuse, its use and exploitation by higher powers, and its image a pale reflection of the character within.

The film ends with the camera entering a belly — perhaps the film acknowledging its navel-gazing.

Amon Tobin's score is tight — perfectly cold and edgy, with traditional music undertones.

Well, if the title wasn't a big enough hint, it's a mummy.

On the plus side, it's hard to get bored. Well, except for the wrestling matches. They wrestle a la G.L.O.W., but the fights are long.

Each marriage (except one oddball) starts with easy living and simple love — what Louisa wants. Invariably, she makes a recommendation or thought, and that husband makes it big and brings in a ton of money, putting a wedge between her and the husband. In their efforts, each husband comes to an untimely end, leaving her with more and more money.

The oddball is her marriage to Rod Anderson Jr, who is already rich. He wins her over by not taking a business call. With him, she goes through a dozen stunning dresses. This lavish life is now what she wants because at least Rod tells her he loves her.

The clothes are all incredible — the filmmakers gave Edith Head carte blanche to make the most audacious pieces.

The sets are solid, but the all-pink house is my favorite.

At the top of a waterfall, Hercules is doing gua sha or something. He calls for Theseus, who is literally rolling around in the hay with Arethusa. Classic Theseus.

King Lico has paid a group to raid Agardia. Spears fly, swords clash, and boys flip. Hercules throws a wooden truck at the baddies. Once they realize Hercules is there, they skidaddle.

The leader of the raiding party goes to King Lico for payment. He shows them a chest of gold that is definitely normal and not full of hidden swords. Lico triggers the hidden swords and kills the leader.

King Lico calls for Deianira, who rises from a tomb, her eyes dazed and distant, like she ate an edible.

Hercules goes to find his fiancée, Deianira. When Hercules arrives, King Lico tells Hercules that the gods have cursed Deianira to sickness. Hercules's muscles quiver with anger.

Hercules appeals to Medea, and she tells him to go to Hades to fetch The Stone of Forgetfulness.

So Hercules grabs his boy, Theseus, who has talked Telemachus into breaking off his engagement to Arethusa so Theseus can fuck her some more. 

Telemachus, being the much-unneeded comic relief, joins Hercules and Theseus on their quest to Hades and all of the fetch quests in between. 

In Hades, the color is psychedelic, and the world has a surreal aura.

The story is overwrought but not tedious.

<blockquote><i>To the almost deaf you have to shout; and to the almost blind, you have to write in very large letters.</i> — Flannery O'Connor</blockquote>

<b>1944 ~ 45, Northern Italy, during the Nazi-Fascist occupation</b>

In the Italian Social Republic, also known as Salò, four wealthy men sign an agreement, beginning with marrying each other's daughters and continuing into a roundup of young men and women. The four men carefully choose who will attend the palace. There, the men and their accomplices will perform sadistic torture for their pleasure.

It's impossible to state how difficult this is to watch. There is no preparation for it.

A gay Marxist filmmaker, Pasolini knows the line between the ritualized fantasy of S&M and the real thing. One occurs with mutual consent and care. The other is the political reality of a Fascist state.

This film does not depict a true story — it presents a dark allegory of the covert nature of Fascism. To bear witness is to be complicit. There is no passivity.

Here, the film presents its atrocities with banal, geometric compositions.

Though diegetic music comes and goes, a deep rumbling rises slowly throughout the movie, culminating in a deafening roar and silence.

The silencing is the essential part. It is silencing any wants beyond those the masters give them. The wealthy men divulge their philosophies of hostility and will to power. Like all Fascist movements, they believe they are the true Anarchists and rebels.

Salò remains an important film because Fascism and anti-queer politics are alive and well. We may have grown numb to the banality of their existence, but as long as it exists, we are complicit in its power.","criterion, hooptober, hooptober8.0, extreme, 1001 movies, nazisploitation",2024-01-06

In trying to run, Tien Ta’s men injure Liu Ye-de. With the help of a local, he sneaks into the Shaolin temple so that he may learn kung fu and teach it to the people.

The process, however, is more complex than he imagined. He must go through 35 chambers to learn all the aspects of kung fu.

Liu Yu-de takes the name San Te. He quickly rises among his peers at the temple. But the abbot refuses his wishes to teach kung fu to outsiders.

The camera zooms in and out with precision. Every hit and swipe has a dramatic sound effect. The fighting is more of a coordinated dance than a fight sequence. Classic kung fu movie.

This film, in particular, creates an engrossing path as San Te learns the various aspects of kung fu. I haven’t seen many kung fu movies, but this one is the best introduction to its mentality and physical training. As a result, when we see San Te put his training into effect, we see pieces of his training coming into play. We understand his choices and may expect them.

Cinema ends in righteous anger. At least, according to the filmmakers who declare its end. For what lies ahead when the anger subsides?

A year before May 68, Godard's world-ending vision is a formalist exercise that marries the surreal allegory to unambiguous rhetoric. It doesn't always succeed, but it is a fascinating experiment.

Orlac is a famous pianist. His wife, Yvonne, goes to the train station to meet him upon returning from his tour. But Orlac's train collides with another.

Folks rush and scramble to assist anyone who may be injured. Yvonne goes to the location of the wreck to find Orlac. She climbs in and out of shattered rail cars. She finds him severely injured.

A spotlight casts an unsettling glow on the car as Yvonne drives to the wreck.

Meanwhile, a convicted killer named Vasseur is to be executed. A professor and his assistant will bring the body to their lab after his death.

The professor cares for Orlac. Yvonne hangs her head like a penitent Mary Magdalene awaiting the news. The professor can save everything but his hands.

<blockquote><i>Save his hands. His hands are more important than his hands.</i></blockquote>

A head watches, laughing in the window. The bandages are removed from Orlac's arms. The hands move.

He can no longer play the piano like before. They also do not embrace Yvonne as before — the hands have their machinations.

The film drags a bit, even by silent movie standards, as it indulges in dread and anticipation.

The film is full of beautifully composed shots that create a ton of space, putting characters at the edges.

The sisters are plotting something for Mortimer and Elaine. They also have a nasty habit of poisoning people.

This movie is exhausting.

""Teddy Roosevelt"" Brewster is a massively annoying character who gets too much screen time.

Cary Grant is awful in this. He's abandoned all subtlety or comedic timing to play a Looney Tune.

Grant is at his best in scenes with Lorre, who brings Grant down to reality.

Boris Karloff was supposed to play Raymond Massey's role. Nevertheless, they continue with the role, letting the absence of a joke fog up the movie further.

Of course, the lighting, sets, camera work, and other mechanical facets of filmmaking are all competent.

I need to make it clear that I wanted to like this. On paper, this is my deal. But the execution is maddening. It comes so close to funny and fumbles every single joke.

Mabuse hypnotizes Hull, introducing himself as Hugo Balling. He follows Hull to the 17+4 club, where they play cards and gamble. Hull's advisors tell him to stop playing, but he continues losing money to Hull.

When Hull comes to, he doesn't remember inviting Balling, playing cards, or anything.

The state attorney comes to Hull. Hull is not the first fishy gambling incident. The attorney elicits Hull's help in tracking down and capturing this crook.

As the pursuit continues, the stakes grow higher. Kidnappings, murders, explosions — will the police catch Dr. Mabuse?

The copy of the movie I have is low-resolution. I struggled to identify the faces and read the on-screen text. I went to YouTube for Part II when I realized I only had Part I. Lo-and-behold, I found a 4K upscaled version of both parts. You live and learn.

The plot is intricate, and the film introduces a lot of details upfront. Starting the movie with a stock market exploit is bold but reflective of the times. But once Mabuse gets into action, it becomes easier to piece together what is happening.

I'm curious about the filmmakers' assumptions regarding the audience's familiarity with Mabuse, given that it was a serialized story during the movie's release.

The first half is slow plotting and schemes. The second half is the pursuit of Mabuse, which has more action as Mabuse ""mercilessly annihilates"" anyone who gets in his way, even his allies. Both parts need one another — you won't care about the action if you don't have the story, and the story requires the catharsis of the action.

I enjoyed this, but I wish it were shorter and tighter. I've heard the rumor of an Eisenstein cut. Still, this movie is foundational for action and mystery films.","youtube, written by women, 1001 movies, anti-criterion challenge 2024, acc2024",2024-01-09

Marti's family is moving to a military base — her father, Steve, her step-mom Carol, and Carol's six-year-old son, Andy. Steve works for the EPA, and they have asked him to test the water and surrounding area for effects from the toxic chemicals tested at the base.

At a gas station, a man pins Marti against the wall and warns her of something that ""gets you when you sleep.""

While testing, a man approaches Steve, telling him about people with odd psychological behavior — paranoia, insomnia. Steve reassures him that the chemicals at the base wouldn't have those effects.

This film is yet another adaptation of Invasion of the Body Snatchers. But the special effects and creepy vibes help this one stand out.

I don't care about the metaphor. It could be conformity or the American nuclear family or whatever.

The best part about this movie is that it's less than 90 minutes, so it doesn't overstay its welcome.

Oliva, standing in a clock tower, overlooks the village and its eccentricities.

Robert gets milk for his cat Cica and Robert's gerbil before school. 

He asks the kids to draw what they like or dislike about their town. We see those likes and dislikes projected on their papers, reflecting their honest feelings, even if it scares them to voice them.

Oliva comes to the school and tells the kids about a cat with sunglasses whose eyes reveal a person's true nature via color. The people in the story killed the cat to avoid facing the truth.

The kids then draw pictures of cats. They're all great. In at least one case, the kid is drawing it.

A float operated by people decked in all-black rides into town. A woman named Diana is on the float holding a cat with sunglasses named Mourek.

Cica and Mourek run off together and hang out. Robert chases after them and meets Diana. Robert says she's the most beautiful girl he's seen, and I'm inclined to agree with him.

At a performance, clothes dance without a body. They put on a show that mirrors events we've seen in the movie.

Diana flies in as a red rose — the color of love. 

Cats appear, including Mourek. Diana takes off its sunglasses, and people change color. People group according to their colors and dancing.

A frenzy breaks out. Some want to kill the cat, while others want to save it. Most are afraid of it revealing their true colors.

At one point, the kids take collective action and boycott the school, which rules.

The film is whimsical and earnest. Like The Peanut Butter Solution, it has its peculiar logic and appeals to kids and adults.

The story is slight, with long bouts of music and delightful magical moments.

The people's colors are so vibrant. It's almost overstimulating. I love it.

Sarah crawls into a bathtub. Her feet touch something on the edge of the tub. She convulses and dies.

Elise drives a white convertible to a picaresque villa. She drinks a refreshing Coca-Cola when a bump startles her. In walks Marcus, her stepson, whom she had not met until now. He wasn't supposed to be home until later that week.

Sarah was Marcus's mother.

Marcus touches Elise in uncomfortable ways, rubbing her arms and clasping her breasts. Elise tries to ignore it.

Marcus steals a letter from the mail. He claims it's from a book club, but Elise questions him, mostly out of curiosity. Marcus tells her that Lot's wife turned into a pillar of salt for being curious.

When Paul comes home, he dotes on Marcus more than Elise.

Marcus tries to sew dissent between Paul and Elise. He whispers to Paul that Elise doesn't like him and that Elise suspects Marcus of stealing money.

Elise finds pieces of a torn-up expulsion letter from Marcus's school. She goes to Marcus's school to get the facts. What she learns about Marcus shocks her. What's worse, Paul knew about it.

The movie is well-structured. It doesn't go where I expected — it's a giallo, so it has to twist — but it all fits the text of the movie.

Britt Ekland gives a fantastic performance — she has a lot to do in this movie, and she pulls it off.

<blockquote><i>In Europe, between the 15th and 16th centuries, it is estimated nearly eight million people were convicted of heresy and executed by fanatical witchhunters to save their souls. Their deaths on the scaffold or the funeral pile were, for them, the release from agonizing torture, which often lasted for years. This motion picture shows three cases taken from authentic documents from the time when witch-hunting had reached its peak and can only give a slight idea of the cruelties of one of the blackest pages in the history of Man.</i></blockquote>

Count Christian von Meruh comes to town to assist the witchfinder in prosecuting witches. He brings his executioner, John Wilkins, with him. The Count serves Lord Cumberland.

People flee the town based on Cumberland's reputation.

Albino, the town's witchfinder, fears losing his position. He has his advocate look for written confessions to use for forgeries.

Albino tries to fuck Vanessa, a server. When she won't, he accuses her of being a witch.

Christian, however, develops feelings for her and doubts the accusation.

So when Lord Cumberland declares her a witch, Christian tries to remain steady. But when he sees a different side of Lord Cumberland, he questions his life choices.

Maybe in 1970, this required a vomit bag, but this is relatively tame by today's standards. What happens to the accused, however, is fucked up.

In the end, it doesn't do much with its premise, leaning more into the brutality of the torture being enough. It isn't.

Tamazusa and Motofuji lead an army to take a royal family whose cursed blood unleashes some power. Princess Shizu, however, has escaped.

Shizu declares vengeance on Motofuji.

A samurai named Shinbei finds Princess Shizu at his home but believes she is a man. Once he sees her ass wiggle, however, he discovers she's a woman, so he tries to rape her.

Two samurai in white intercede, taking Shizu to safety. They are descendants of her family's retainers. But Shinbei overhears she is a princess and has a reward on her head. So, he keeps in proximity, waiting for his moment to strike.

The samurai tells Shizu of a legend in which she will undo a family curse. There are eight beads that she must unify. Each bead receives the help of a samurai. The samurai that rescued Shizu already have two.

One samurai is dying from a disease, so they only have one month to find the six samurai.

Not everyone understands the meaning of the bead they possess. Some only know that it glows around their enemies.

Meanwhile, Motofuji's army of soldiers and ghosts are hunting for Princess Shizu.

The film explores the nature of fate and destiny — feeling bound to fate, denying your fate, or fate having a more significant role for you than your birth.

The soundtrack has a lot of guitars, which I love. It is very synth-driven and very 80s. It may be my favorite part of the movie.

While the plot is dull, beautiful colors and a rich atmosphere make the movie more engaging. The <i>Seven Samurai</i> structure makes this movie super long.

The fights are okay. They are not tight, but not boring either. They are at their best when they involve giant bugs and snakes.

I appreciate the aesthetics, but it's too long to love.

It begins with a communion wafer. An older woman receives the wafer but spits it out and pockets it. An altar boy notices and reports her to the religious officials. He delights in the woman's tears and begs for mercy. She meant to give it to her cow so that it may receive God's blessing and produce milk.

The Father declares her a witch, but Deacon Lautner tries to de-escalate, showing that she's a superstitious older woman. The Father doesn't relent and insists on a judge to oversee an inquisition.

When all you see are sinners, everyone becomes a witch. The judge stresses to the royalty that the older woman is a small part of a more dire witch problem.

When one woman accuses the inquisitor of being the Devil, he has his assistant choke her to death, blaming the death on the Devil.

<blockquote><i>Everything comes from the Devil, especially wealth.</i></blockquote>

Lautner tries to enforce temperance. The inquisitor feels inferior around Lautner because Lautner has many books. Seeking a way to prosecute him, he shares a story with one of the accused. A story that she saw Deacon Lautner and his cook, Zuzana, at a Black Mass.

The Father, seeing women who quietly ask forgiveness for lying about being witches, grows to regret his piety. He begs for the trials to stop. Everyone gives him the same advice: shut up and save yourself.

<blockquote><i>— I can't understand how a man like him can be allowed to have the power to decide the fate of others.
— It will always be so.
— If that's true, I'd rather die!</i></blockquote>

The priests discuss how prisons have the power to destroy individuals and strip them of everything. They dismissed one judge because he could not see justice in prisons.

We see how fear is the tool of fascist regimes. How the propaganda of what the Devil is capable of sustains the power structure.

The Czech government banned this movie as the witch trials depicted evoke the show trials in Communist regimes, where a defendant has already received their verdict, and the court presented the defendant to the public as a warning to any dissidents.

Unlike <i>Mark of the Devil</i> (1970), this story empathizes with its characters. It shows the tortures at first, but once we know their deal, we see the aftermath because it allows us to care for these characters.

The rich enjoy their comfort while they persecute the poor and make examples of them.

This movie escalates brilliantly in its intensity. It's infuriating because I've seen and read enough to confirm these are not exaggerations. If anything, this film cannot depict the torture inflicted upon people.

But it's enough. In black and white, the gore is more believable.

In a snowy New England town, four men sit in a dark wood study. Only the fireplace provides any light. Sears James (John Houseman) tells a story about someone buried alive. With him are Ricky Hawthorne (Fred Astaire), Edward Charles Wanderley (Douglas Fairbanks Jr.), and Dr. John Jaffrey (Melvyn Douglas).

This is the Chowder Society. They cheer for their group with their snifters of brandy.

At night, these men have terrible nightmares. Except for Sears, who doesn't sleep much anymore. Screams, a cold body, and a shared secret.

Edward's son, David (Craig Wasson), falls out of a hotel window and dies. This scene is so silly in how it's composed that I laughed.

Though the reports say suicide, his twin brother, Donny (Craig Wasson), suspects otherwise.

In the attic, Donny uncovers a picture of four men from their younger days. With them, a blurry-faced woman.

Donny shows up at the Chowder Society, paying for his entry with a scary story. It is a story about Alma (Alice Krige), a woman he fell in love with — who became something he couldn't understand.

Donny thinks Alma is the woman in the photo.

God, this movie is boring. Initially, nobody mentioned names, so I had to search them up to remember who's who.

It's hard to believe this movie is based on a popular novel considering how little it delivers. It establishes a dark mood early on, but as it goes, it loses all flavor.

It's pretty obvious straight out of the gate what is happening. We have to wait for the movie to reveal the answer. Except that is the movie. The story concludes once the characters are aware of what we know.

The film plods through a well-worn story with little character development. This removes all tension from the movie besides a jump scare or two.

Alice Krige delivers a standout performance in the movie because of her well-defined character. She's hot and weird and a little scary.

Despite being big hitters, the four older men in this movie are indistinguishable. They give a flashback to see how serious and brooding Sears is, but it changes nothing.

The movie wanted to rely on the familiar faces of the famous actors instead of developing personalities or any emotional resonance.

Devoid of relatability and perspective, we merely witness the characters' transitioning between scenes.

Kay has a recurring nightmare where something is chasing her. Something inhuman.

Kay and her husband, David, pick up Kay's brother, Eric, and Eric's wife, Brooke, to go on an island vacation. They take a plane to the island.

They expected a sunny trip, but the island was overcast and windy. During summer, the island is replete with tourists. Now, only four remain.

This place seems familiar to Kay. The pilot interjects:

<blockquote><i>You ain't the first to say that, and you won't be the last. People have dreams about places like this.</i></blockquote>

They find a rundown, abandoned theater. It looks exactly like a place Kay has painted before. Kay's painting has transitioned to surrealism, pulling images from her dreams.

The pilot warns of an incoming storm, offering them a chance to leave. They decide to take their chances.

An oar blow to the head results in the fisherman's murder. Kay startles awake.

The high-level concept is very similar to Stephen King's book, Duma Key, in that an artist manifests what they paint. This, however, is far more interesting.

From a slasher perspective, this movie falls short. While the special effects for the kills are top-notch, they offer nothing new.

Because of the subjective, open-ended structure of the narrative, however, the film has multiple interpretations. Using dream logic, premonitions, and self-referential scenes leaves you wondering if it happened or who did what.

This can be problematic, as the author's intention remains unclear. But this ambiguity keeps me thinking about the movie.

They spend time arguing over Kay's dreams, but they get out of the loop before it becomes unbearable.

This movie will only appeal to slasher enthusiasts. While it isn't a great movie, it is fascinating.

An oil rig in the middle of the ocean is digging but isn't hitting oil. At 20,000 feet, they should have hit oil by now.

Phillip wakes up screaming, and Mark checks on him.

<blockquote><i>— I had a dream
— That's what Martin Luther King said, but this isn't it
— Something bad is gonna happen
— Yeah, we're going to be busting our backs for the glory of Zortron Oil
— I dreamt we're all gonna die
— An hour at a time, as always</i></blockquote>

Mark has a snarky comeback for everything!

Two men are down after an accident. Scott, the company geologist, has authority and says to keep going. Jake says oil shouldn't be around here. Scott says otherwise.

A helicopter flies in two replacements: Harry and Colette. Robyn takes to Harry. Colette is the new crane operator. Because she's a woman, Jake refuses to believe she is as versatile as she claims.

While drilling, the crew pulls up some unusual rocks. A lamprey-like creature with a Xenomorph face breaks through and bites Phillip. They kill the creature but Phillip dies within seconds.

Then Sam picks up one rock, and it cuts his finger. He loses his grip, climbs the crane, and jumps, killing himself.

The barbed rocks break open. Something living crawls out of it. Despite that, Scott preserves the eggs and observes them.

Being a PG, made-for-TV movie, we will not get sex and violence. So, the film uses most of its runtime to develop characters and relationships. They're shallow and melodramatic, but at least they're trying to define some personality for the characters.

The special effects are solid, probably because they had no issue ripping off the Alien designs. Here, that isn't a bad thing.

This will rock no one's world, but because it is a functional human drama, the disappointing horror elements don't kill the movie.

<b>Thoughts / Spoilers:</b>
* I like the alternate title, <i>The Lucifer Rig</i>. Less so, <i>Alien Rig</i>. <i>The Intruder Within</i> sounds like my intrusive thoughts.
* Amazing IMDb trivia: ""The design for the creature is sometimes misattributed to H.R. Giger; in fact, Giger had no involvement in its creation.""
* Robin takes off her clothes and bends over so everyone gets a good look at her thermals. Classic made-for-TV horniness.
* Michael Hogan! He gives a signature freakout. ""This ain't an oil rig — it's a floating graveyard!""
* Jake's daughter is in India with a guru, searching for enlightenment.
* They even do a chest-bursting scene — except the Xenomorph puppet is laughing as it bounces up and down on a guy.
* The geologist returns to Noah's flood, pulling out an evolution chart. Then decides, ""It's an underwater alien.""
* Okay, the alien makes them horny. Neat!
* Oh, rapey, less neat.
* I like Mark and Robyn's friendship! He shows her brotherly affection and care, making them comfortable around each other.
* The fully grown monster looks closer to Nemesis from <i>Resident Evil</i> than a Xenomorph.

Bluesy rock as two women walk the castle grounds. They each grab a candelabra and go up the stairs. At the top, two vampires, chained to the walls, drive stakes into their hearts. One tells the women that they must go to the tomb and stab the others.

Night falls as they enter the graveyard. They open the crypt, but they are too late. A woman emerges from her grave. The women scream.

A newlywed couple goes to a castle to see the bride's two cousins. She hasn't seen them since childhood. All she remembers is that the castle is beautiful and the cousins are weird.

But a woman in town tells them that the cousins died yesterday. Still, they drive up to the castle. There, the two women from earlier greet them — custodians of the castle who served the cousins.

The bell tolls, and a woman named Isolde crawls out of the clock. She plays with the bride's hair. The bride is entranced. Isolde takes the bride to the graveyard, where they and the custodians drink from a goblet. Isolde bites the bride on the neck.

Things are not what they seem. For one, the cousins are still alive. Technically.

The cousins used to be vampire hunters — renowned ones at that time— but alas, the vampires got them. So now they're insufferable dweebs for eternity.

The atmosphere is so perfectly gothic — the castle, the fog, skulls, and candles everywhere — I love it

The music is annoying late psychedelic guitar trash.

Plot-wise, this isn't interesting. I guess because there isn't a strong plot — it's predominantly vibes.

A Civilization gone with the wind...</i></blockquote>Yikes!

The version on Max has an essential TCM intro by Jacqueline Stewart. She helps contextualize the controversies surrounding the film — namely, that the movie paints an idyllic Antebellum South, lost to time.

The production was aware of the problematic depiction of black people and assured the NAACP that they were ""sensitive to their feelings."" Regardless, the film ignores the brutality and indignity of chattel slavery and paints its black characters as either inept or devoted servants to their masters.

Its nostalgic lens denies the reality of slavery and inequality — the black cast members couldn't even attend the premiere because of Jim Crow laws. Hattie McDaniel, despite her nomination for Mammy, could not sit with her other white cast members at the award ceremony.

The intro doesn't touch on other controversies, such as the film's romantic depiction of marital rape. The ""she secretly wants it"" trope has only recently received public discourse and scrutiny. There is a complex discussion to have around the subject, especially in the context of fantasy and agency, that I am not equipped to engage, but felt it necessary to at the very least acknowledge.

Growing up in the South, I heard these nostalgic and white supremacist values propagated through fellow students and teachers. This film is not the sole cause, but it reinforces harmful stereotypes and contributes to contemporary historical perspectives from audiences and Hollywood.

Adjusted for inflation, this is one of the highest-earning movies in history. It was the first to out-earn <i>Birth of a Nation</i>. Its glossy high production value has sustained its position as one of the most influential movies in history.

Some viewers may say, ""setting controversies aside"" when discussing the movie. But there is no movie without those controversies — they are the themes and values that the story wishes to emphasize.

As someone who watches too many movies, I have invariably seen this movie's fingerprint on the films that follow it. I watch this with the intent of seeing its impact and informing my understanding of what people believe and what movies have the power to accomplish, for better or worse.

Miguel is still stalking women. And murders are still happening. Is it Miguel?

<blockquote><i>By 2001 AD, capitalistic countries have privatized all government organizations. Prisons, like carparks, have become franchised businesses... </i></blockquote>A police bus goes through several security checkpoints to a remote prison. The bus drops off a group of seven men, all in handcuffs. Among them is Ricky, who the state sentenced to serve ten years for manslaughter and assault.

He immediately causes trouble because his chest sets off the metal detector. An x-ray shows bullets lodged in his skin — souvenirs, as Ricky calls them.

A group called Gang of Four — Hell, Tarzan, White God, and Roaring Sea — guards the four quadrants of the prison. Ricky witnesses their brutality, and it fills him with rage.

Someone is trying to take out Ricky. But he proves over and over that he can handle himself. We see a training flashback where he learns to channel the strength of his enemies and becomes stronger.

I've wanted to watch this for years, as Stuart Wellington of <i>The Flop House</i> loves it. But its description has scared me, too.

The film is brutally violent but also bizarrely comical. Everyone is getting hurt or killed in ridiculous ways.

Fan Siu-Wong, who plays Ricky, is obscenely muscular and handsome. His shirt is off a whole bunch 

I lost interest in some of the slower parts. Every moment that isn't outrageous violence isn't that interesting.

<b>Denmark, 1925</b>

Borgensgard, home to the Borgen family — the widower, Morten, and his three sons.

Anders wakes up to find Johannes wandering the dunes at night. He informs his father, and the two go to look for him.

Mikkel's wife, Inger, sees Anders going after Johannes and informs Mikkel. Mikkel joins Anders and Morten.

At the top of a dune, Johannes proclaims himself as Jesus Christ, condemning those who don't believe. His voice resonates and intermingles with the wind.

Inger pities Anders, while Mikkel believes Anders is likely happy in his delusional state.

<blockquote><i>— Miracles don't happen anymore.
— Nothing is impossible if one prays to Him for it.
— I have prayed and prayed and prayed
— Then you must go on praying, for Jesus has promised what we pray to Him for, He will give us.</i></blockquote>

Anders has fallen in love with Anne, whose father Peter has different religious ideas than Morten. Mikkel and Inger are supportive, but they warn Anders that Morten will probably not approve.

<blockquote><i>Little granddad, you understand everything in the world except love.</i></blockquote>

Peter warns Anne regarding Anders — that she should not let sin control her. Peter, a Christian, thinks Anne may help the Borgens find his god. Anders tries to convince him otherwise, but Peter sees his Christianity as distinct.

Peter's family follows the Inner Mission, a conservative and fundamentalist denomination derived from Lutheranism. By their name, their mission is to convert other Christians to their line of thinking, unlike other denominations that focus their evangelism on non-believers.

Mikkel resents Morten's devoutness. It was a barrier between them growing up. As Mikkel has grown older, his faith has dwindled, though he hides it from Inger.

Inger, the most devout, believes prayers set unseen forces in motion. Her eyes are often on the sky. When her pregnancy makes her dangerously sick, the experience tests everyone's faith.

The grassy dunes and the sky create beautiful shapes and compositions. The camera moves along horizontal tracking, letting the dunes rise and fall like sound waves.

Dreyer believed that the long take was essential to sound film. Dreyer believed cuts reflected the juxtaposition necessary for silent film to render meaning. With the addition of sound, the camera should linger and follow to allow scenes to develop more organically.

This film marks a trajectory from <i>Days of Wrath</i> to <i>Gertrud</i>, where Dreyer enforces a more subdued emotional state for the characters. This film, however, does not commit to the deadened tone of <i>Gertrud</i>.

Part of what makes Dreyer's films feel painterly is his obsession with lighting. He set up around 20 lights per scene and wouldn't adjust the camera according to a light meter but to his feelings.

The film suggests that studying one's faith leads to either abandoning it or distorting it to match personal beliefs. Morten, a devout Christian, encouraged Johannes in his studies, believing it would reignite not just his faith but of his sons as well. Morten thought Johannes would be a prophet.

Central to the movie is the idea that miracles do not happen anymore. Even those with faith deny their presence in their life. Inger remains the only one who believes, pointing out the tiny miracles of every day.

<blockquote><i>— Now you are blaspheming God.
— No, all of you blaspheme God with your lukewarm faith.</i></blockquote>

While this doesn't hit me like <i>Days of Wrath</i>, this is still a beautifully realized movie and certainly one of Dreyer's best.","criterion channel, criterion challenge 2024, cc2024, 1001 movies, sight and sound, claire denis req",2024-01-16

Adam pointed out that the movie engages with a Hollywood and literary world from decades ago rather than addressing current issues. Not that we've made many strides in representation. It just looks different now than when <i>Boyz n the Hood</i> came out.

A cat's shriek. Distorted organ music and pitch-shifted voices.

Sam Baker heads down to the basement. On the basement steps lay a cat with its throat slit. At the bottom of the stairs stands Henrietta, a young girl in a white dress. Crying, she holds a pair of bloody scissors.

Her father, Sam, punishes her for her sinful behavior, locking her in the dark indefinitely.

Back upstairs, Sam changes a lightbulb. The lightbulb stretches and explodes. Then, an axe held by gnarled hands fell into Sam's skull.

Henrietta's mother enters the room. The mirror bends and distorts, shooting shards of glass through the room. They pierce the mother's face and eyes. The gnarled hand brings a kitchen knife into her throat, pinning her to the door.

Downstairs, Henrietta cries, holding onto a clown doll that produces the strange music.

<i>Twenty Years Later</i>

Late one night, Paul's radio ""goes crazy,"" and he hears a voice calling for help. A terrible scream. The sound of distorted organ music. It happens again in front of his girlfriend, Martha. They decide to track down the source of the radio signal.

They pick up a hitchhiker. He talks about ghosts and fucks with them, so they force him out. They reach the location — surprise! It's the Baker house.

When they arrive, they find the radio in the attic. And then they discover they're not alone.

Straight away, Martha experiences similar phenomena to what the Bakers did.

At one point, a television turns on. Henrietta appears on the screen, unchanged since we last saw her twenty years ago. With her is her clown doll.

There's also a guy running around who is also killing people.

The movie's dialogue is hilarious. I had to fight myself from transcribing the whole script. I don't know how intentional it is, but I was entertained.

This was such a magnificent scene:

<blockquote><i>— You can't know what's going to happen in the future.
— Yes, you can! Cases of precognition have occurred!
— Since when are you into that stuff?
— About 45 minutes. I checked out this book while you were in the shower.
— Oh
— You remember Jack the Ripper? The psychopath who butchered seven women?
— Yeah
— Well, there was this Anglican priest who had a vision of the last murder a few days before it happened
— Where?
— In a streetcar
— The murder took place in a streetcar?
— No, the minister was on a streetcar when he suddenly had the vision! Are you getting stupid or something?
— Look who's talking! Did you learn all that when I was washing my hair?
— Are you serious?
— Would you climb off your high horse? You know what? I've had enough. Goodbye!</i></blockquote>Plot points rely on a passing knowledge of citizen band radio, but it doesn't matter if you don't understand — it's not like the plot is coherent.

This movie is so entertaining! A bunch of weird shit happens, and it varies the haunting phenomena.

None of the performances are that good. Everyone delivers lines like a <i>Shenmue</i> character (iykyk). But everyone's screams and cries are effective.

The soundtrack is so 1988 — it reminds me of the <i>Goosebumps</i> TV show.

The movie loses momentum before the climax while attempting to establish a plot for the events. 

Still, this is a blast.

American helicopters fly in to congratulate the boys on a successful training exercise. Jennifer joins Spike and Steve as the person in charge of communications.

Cue the opening credits of fog, women in leotards stretching, and Spike posing with his sword. I get James Bond vibes.

In Manila, a group of tourists board a tour bus. When the tour bus passes a wedding, guns go off as wedding members strip their disguises and board the bus, taking the bus hostage.

Cheering them on is Blackie Dammett, father of Anthony Kiedis, playing Alby the Cruel. He wears an eye patch, sits in a wheelchair, and pets a small dog. So he must be our Blofeld surrogate.

The US military sends in our team to save the day.

The film is supposedly a parody of spy films. It certainly refers to them. I suspect it isn’t a “parody” — it’s just a silly film.

Spike goes to hire a sex worker:
<blockquote><i>— I want a clean girl. No clap.
— Are you kidding? My girls are sterilized, sanitized, and lobotomized.</i></blockquote>
That’s the movie’s sense of humor.

I’m not a big James Bond fan, so watching a movie meant to target that market was bound to bore me, regardless.

I’m not hating on anyone who likes this — this just isn’t for me.

<b>Bodega Bay Inn, 1939</b>

Andre, an elderly puppeteer, paints a marionette. His room is full of them. One looks over at him from the window, then back outside. After finishing painting his most recent puppet, he imbues it with life. The puppet's head spins around.

Two men in black trench coats enter the hotel, speaking German. Andre grabs a gun and kills himself as the trenchcoat men burst in.

<b>Present Day (1989)</b>

A group of psychics each receive startling visions, each involving a man named Neil Gallagher. They believe Neil has found the old puppet master's hiding place.

Alex, Dana, Frank, and Carissa convene at The Bodega Bay Inn. Meghan, Neil's wife, meets them. Neil is dead — suicide.

Something isn't adding up. Why did Neil die? How did they not know about it? These psychics are going to channel their abilities to figure it out.

The first act was difficult to follow — introducing five characters before saying why is rough. Even after, the first half of the movie is pretty slow. But once it got going, I got into it.

I like the puppet designs. Some are conventional, but a couple are pretty out there. I wish we got more of them!

Dressed in a Union uniform, Django drags a casket along the rain-soaked mud.

Atop the horizon, he sees some Banditos tying a woman to the support beams of a rickety bridge. They rip open the back of her dress and whip her, punishing her for trying to run away. The other men smile as the red lashes bloom on her back.

A single gunshot, or what sounds like one, cracks in the valley. The Banditos fall. Five men in red scarves put down their guns, untie the woman, and create a makeshift cross on which to burn her.

Django comes down the hill, the casket behind him, his steely blue eyes meeting the men.

Django apologizes to the men before drawing his six-shooter and shooting them before they can register what is happening.

He lends an outstretched hand to the woman named Maria.

<blockquote><i>My name is Django. No one will hurt you anymore as long as you’re with me.</i></blockquote>

One man is still alive. He crawls to his gun. Django, without moving his eyes from Maria, finishes the job and shoots the man. The man’s body slides down the ridge and into the quicksand below. His red scarf is the last piece to sink before he disappears completely.

This is our stellar intro to Django. It’s only the start of his troubles with the men in red. We’ll learn soon that these are the men of ex-Confederate officer Major Jackson.

Jackson gets pleasure out of killing Mexican peons. He rounds them up, lets them loose one at a time, and shoots them like skeet targets.

The film falls into the classic Spaghetti Western theme — no good guys, only worse bad guys. Django eliminating Major Jackson’s men only invites the Mexican bandits. And Django’s code of ethics isn’t exactly conventional.

It’s still a Western, and I’m not a massive fan of them. The gunfights may be silly, but this is a well-constructed movie.

Vietnam soldier and ornithologist Fred Brown returns home after his tour. He finds his wife in bed with another man. Fred goes on a rampage, killing the man, his wife, and his parents. He also kills a hawk, which causes the hawk’s companion to descend, ripping one of Fred’s eyes out and blinding the other eye.

<b>Twenty Years Later</b>

A group of college seniors receives an assignment to track down the ivory-billed woodpecker. Laura discovers the last person to spot the ivory-billed: Fred Brown.

They all go to Brown’s house. Brown gives them a map and other documents to help find, “whatever it is they’re looking for.”

They don’t find the bird, but they find Brown’s old home and set up camp. 

Weird phenomena happen to them, especially Steve — pictures blacking out, doors slamming, and vivid visions that bleed into reality. 

The gore effects are pretty good! However, saves all of its best kills for the end, which means a lot of running around and nothing happening.

I love the punchy electronic score and the lush gothic stuff. I’m not wild about the schmaltzy romantic score.

The audio mixing on this is exceptionally bad. They did not get a steady background sound, so ambient sound pops in and out during dialogue.

The movie has long birdwatching montages. They’re pretty boring.

The plot doesn't make sense, but that isn't that important if the movie is fun. This is fun in places, especially the last 20-30 minutes.

Overall, the movie is decent, but it makes such poor use of its runtime that it's hard to recommend.

<blockquote><i>It has been said that a man's best friend is his mummy. In Egypt today, this theory is to be in great dispute. For two bold adventurers are about to discover another kind of mummy.</i></blockquote>Abbott and Costello sit down at the club in their safari gear. They overhear that Dr. Zoomer needs men to accompany his mummy back to the States. Of course, Costello thinks that Dr. Zoomer meant his mother.

Madame Rontru, a businesswoman, knows that he refers to the Mummy of Klaris. She also knows the mummy holds the key to unlocking an ancient treasure.

So, she enlists the help of the Followers of Klaris to recover the mummy for her. While some fear the Curse of Klaris, Madame Rontru remains unfazed.

<blockquote><i>There is no curse that a gun or a knife can't cure.</i></blockquote>Two of the followers go to Dr. Zoomer's office and incapacitate him. Abbott and Costello arrive to take the job. The followers sneak out with the mummy, while Costello witnesses Klaris moving and groaning, and Dr. Zoomer's body. 

But they leave behind Klaris' amulet — the key to finding the treasure. Abbott and Costello pick it up. Hijinks ensue.

This film is the last installment of the ""Abbott and Costello Meet..."" series, where the two comedians come face-to-face with Universal monsters. The Frankenstein one is the most famous since they encounter Lon Chaney Jr.'s Wolf Man and Bela Lugosi's Dracula. Unfortunately, they couldn't land Karloff for the Frankenstein or the Mummy here.

I grew up with Laurel and Hardy more than Abbott and Costello, but I remember their <i>Looney Tunes</i> counterparts, Babbit and Catstello. Though their sense of humor is broad, Costello makes a lot of funny noises that the <i>Looney Tunes</i> imitated, so their movies still capture a certain nostalgia for me.

The Arabesque jokes are also reminiscent of <i>Looney Tunes</i> — snake charming a rope with a guy on it and whatnot. Even the sets have a cartoon simplicity to them.

That's not to say it looks cheap. This movie clearly had a budget, which helps to sell some of the more absurd jokes.

Their dynamic has a <i>Scooby-Doo</i>-like quality, where Costello witnesses something scary or supernatural, and Abbott gaslights him into thinking he's crazy.

This movie isn't high art, but I got some chuckles.

A minute later, C sits up. He leaves the room, the sheet still covering him, with eyeholes cut out like a child's costume or a klan robe. No one sees him.

A door appears made of pure light.

C walks back to his and M's house, where he lingers.

The filmmakers shot the film in what looks like a rounded Instagram filter and frame. Aesthetics and atmosphere are the movie's principal story mechanisms. If you've seen The Green Knight, you're partway there.

Similar to The Green Knight, the film feels like more of a formal exercise than a movie. The exercise seems to be to strip down the haunted house story to determine what the essentials are.

In this way, it no longer retains the fear or unease of a horror film. By watching from predominantly the ghost's POV, we are not in M's headspace and don't experience her fear.

But we do experience the manifestations of her grief — eating a pie alone on the kitchen floor, freezing in the middle of removing the sheets from the bed — extended takes that let the pain and sadness linger and fill the frame.

</i><i>— No, worse. Human</i></blockquote><b>Stonehaven Maximum Security Prison, Alaska, USA</b>

Oscar Mannheim, or Manny (Jon Voight), is a life-term prisoner. After two escape attempts, the warden welded him to his cell for three years. 

After Manny wins a civil rights case against the prison, Associate Warden Ranken reluctantly lets Manny out of the hole and into the yard.

Manny makes a promise to his boys that he's going break out of there. He needs some time.

Ranken gets another prisoner to stab Manny. So Manny has to move up his escape plan to mid-winter.

Buck (Eric Roberts) sneaks Manny out with the laundry. But Buck doesn't want to stay behind, so he follows Manny out, not realizing the extent of what it takes to escape prison and survive in the world.

They make it to a train station and trainhop. The conductor has a heart attack and falls off the train, leaving it speeding down the tracks. And it's only getting faster.

The film explores a few themes. One of the major ones is prison life versus the outside world. Some folks try to break out and get caught. Some get their release and still wind up back in prison. Prison doesn't teach humans how to live in the world.

When Buck gets out, he has a vision of Vegas and women. Manny, on the other hand, sees a life of menial work and swallowing pride because anything is better than the prison he experienced.

It also explores what it means to be a hero and how individual metrics can vary. The inmates see Manny as a hero because he stood up to the man and won. But Manny is an isolated, self-serving creature, and when the opportunity comes, he may not do what you expect.

Jon Voight and Eric Roberts are great. Manny and Buck's relationship is tenuous at best, so their tension never eases. Manny is used to being a loner and a realist, and Buck is a loudmouth with his head in the clouds.

I won't spoil how Rebecca De Mornay enters the story, but she's stellar.

The effects and stunts are a standout! This movie has aged so well in that regard. The train feels like a horrifying, unstoppable monster.

A man screams. Brandon and Phillip, their gloved hands pulling a rope around David's neck, strangling him to death. They put the man in a chest.

Brandon is cheerful. In his eyes, they committed an immaculate murder. He grabs the champagne he put on ice just before David's arrival.

Phillip is distraught. He regrets killing David and voices that he wishes he'd killed Brandon instead. Afraid of Brandon's charm.

To add to the exhilaration, they throw a dinner party in the apartment with David's body. David's parents and fiancée, Janet, will attend. Also, Janet's ex, Kenneth.

Brandon dresses the chest as a table and has dinner on top of it.

<blockquote><i>— We agreed that there is one crime we could commit. The crime of making a mistake. Of being weak.
</i><i>— Because it's being human?
</i><i>— Because it's being ordinary.</i></blockquote>But we quickly learn just how moronic Brandon is. If not that, then Phillip's weak nerves will give them away.

Last to arrive is Rupert, but not before several minutes dedicated to discussing his cunning and aversion to social mores. Rupert is also a big fan of murder, thinking of it as art.

Once Rupert enters, Brandon goes weak in the knees. Rupert easily humiliates Brandon and calls to attention all of the weirdness in his party. His conversations with the dinner guests stoke his curiosity.

Phillip is in love with Brandon and follows him in fearful adoration. Brandon is in love with himself and flourishes it in front of everyone. Rupert is, at best, a means of accenting his perceived brilliance.

James Stewart is bizarre. His character is an odd combination of murder enthusiast and clever interrogator. Draining him of charm doesn't do the movie any favors, but Stewart still makes it work.

Joan Chandler is wonderful, and Janet is the only character that is recognizably human. It's a pity she made so few movies.

The filmmakers shot several takes, knitting some scenes with clever edits (aka zooming into someone's back). It draws far too much attention to itself and is the weakest part of the movie by far.

The remaster has an upscaled fps, leading to distracting bleeds, artifacts, and dropped frames throughout.

Janet calls Phillip queer for not eating chicken.

My favorite background lines are two people discussing Brandon:

<blockquote><i>— This can't happen! In the middle of a city, during the day...
</i><i>— Then let's pinch each other and wake up</i></blockquote>Throughout a Saturday in Los Angeles, a series of events converge into a powder keg of violence.

Cholos accrue automatic weapons and take to the streets.

Lt. Bishop is assigned to watch over a closing precinct for its last night open.

A bus with three death row inmates has to make a stop when one of them gets sick. They stop at Bishop's precinct.

A distraught man runs into the building. He cannot speak, but we know that he shot and killed a Cholo. And they want vengeance.

The phone line goes out. Then the power. Then all hell breaks loose.

This script has several moving parts, and it maneuvers through it expertly. At the core, it's a Western, but with a limited budget, everything is modernized. The result is a tense and magnetic pot-boiler where everything convenes into a nightmare.

The action is mostly unadorned. Bullets fly, and people die. It feels more like a horror movie than an action flick. When gang members climb through the windows, the <i>Night of Living Dead</i> influence leaps out.

As I associate <i>Riki-Oh: The Story of Ricky</i> with Stewart Wellington from <i>The Flop House</i> podcast, I associate this movie with Elliott Kalan from the same podcast. This is one of his favorites, and I understand why.

Laurie Zimmer is such a fucking badass. They get a scene where the street light cuts across her face like a noir and she delivers a cold speech.

The dialogue gets cheesy in a couple of places, and the pacing before the climax isn't great. But this movie nails a lot and is one of the best action movies I've seen.","tubi, cmc, cmc2016",2024-01-21

""Dreams"" is a collection of stories based on dreams that Akira Kurosawa had. The result is a series of fairy tales starring a surrogate Kurosawa, credited as ""I."" Kurosawa's ""I"" falls subject to the mercurial world of dream logic, a passive agent to a world he barely understands.

The key emphasis in each story is the visuals. And they are beautiful. Seeing this on the big screen someday would be amazing.

They also have an intentional artifice to them that evokes Noh theater. ""I"" performs the role of the waki. The waki, a visitor, learns the place's story from a shite. ""I"" is not the protagonist of his own story.

As a last film, this contrasts with Miyazaki's most recent film, The Boy and the Heron. Both movies immerse the viewers in dream logic. Where Miyazaki falters is, perhaps, trying to unify his disparate dreams rather than let them be episodic as they are here. This film, however, does not arrive anywhere.

I plan on revisiting this movie after seeing more of Kurosawa's earlier work, especially the color ones like Ran.

This movie is stunning and unique, shining brightest when it focuses on the personal rather than the universal.


<b>Sunshine Through the Rain</b>
A mother warns a young boy about when the sun shines through rain. That foxes have their weddings then and dislike to be observed. That terrible things happen. The boy goes into the woods against his mother's wishes. He witnesses a fox wedding procession and must face the consequences.

Beautiful visuals — rich colors of tall trees, bending flowers, and a rainbow. Kabuki-like performers symbolically represent the foxes and their wedding. The cadence has the fearful tread of a fox, occasionally stopping to look around. Compositions swallow the child in a world too big and beautiful to comprehend.


<b>The Peach Orchard</b>
During Hinamatsuri, a boy serves six meals to five girls. One is missing, but no one else is aware of this sixth girl. A girl in pink appears only to him. He follows the girl to a multi-tiered hill where peach trees once grew. There, he meets hina dolls dressed in Heian period court attire — spirits of the former trees. The boy discovers what people lose when they cut down a peach tree.

<blockquote><i>I can buy peaches at the store. But where can I buy a peach orchard in bloom?</i></blockquote>

A fluid camera takes the boy from his home through the fog. The court attire is gorgeous, especially with the bright sunlight. 


<b>The Blizzard</b>
Four mountaineers make their way up a mountain path during a blizzard. One by one, they stop in their tracks and give in to death. The leader tries to carry on when a yokai appears to him.

Dense fog, heaving breaths. This one is pretty tedious at first. Everyone moves in slow motion. The world is a blanket of white. But after several minutes, its intention becomes apparent.


<b>The Tunnel</b>
""I,"" a company commander in WWII military uniform, walks bleak roads. An anti-tank dog, glowing red, snarls at him. He enters a tunnel. Across the way, he meets a ghost. The ghost is a private who served under him.

This piece reflects on survivor's guilt and the agony of death darkly and quietly. A commander feels he has failed his entire platoon. This one hit me. The ability to apologize to the ghosts of your past failures is a powerful image.


<b>Crows</b>
""I,"" an art student, visits a Van Gogh exhibit. He enters one painting to see Van Gogh and follows Van Gogh through several other paintings.

<blockquote><i>I have to hurry. There's so little time for me to paint.</i></blockquote>

Kurosawa wrote in his memoir that he wanted to be a painter but felt that he realized he didn't have a unique perspective after seeing the works of artists like Van Gogh. This film is easily his most painterly. There's an entire conversation you can have about Kurosawa and color. I don't have enough understanding to engage meaningfully in that.

Scorsese as Van Gogh is an odd choice. Maybe this is Kurosawa's way of connecting painting and film as artistic expressions.


<b>Mount Fuji in Red</b>
A red sky. Flames erupt around Mt. Fuji. Its rocks glow red. The nuclear power plant exploded. Everyone runs in panic, but they know they have nowhere to run. Everyone disappears except for ""I"" and three others. The ocean depths hold the others.

When critics talk about this movie being didactic, this is one segment they're likely referring to. 


<b>The Weeping Demon</b>
""I"" walks a desolate land. Behind him are the ruins of a destroyed city. He encounters a horned demon who used to be human. It laments the world of before, where flowers grew.

The aesthetic and narrative of this segment are notably simpler, almost resembling a children's movie. While I understand Kurosawa's dispair regarding nuclear power, I don't know who this segment is for. It looks intense, though!


<b>Village of the Watermills</b>
""I"" enters a village with no name, where every home seems to have a water wheel. Children pick flowers and place them on a stone. An older gentleman works on a water wheel. He laments the difference between ""convenient"" and ""good"" and discusses being one with nature.

This one provides a peaceful and soft contrast to the past two segments' nightmares. Kurosawa fervently advocates for the importance of the natural world.","criterion, criterion challenge 2024",2024-01-22

<blockquote><i>You know what's going to happen? They're gonna rape this whole goddamn landscape. They're gonna rape it.</i></blockquote>

Four men decide to canoe down the Cahulawassee River one last time before it's dammed and the entire valley floods.

They are total jackasses to the locals, acting superior — especially Lewis (Burt Reynolds). Bobby (Ned Beatty) passively follows Lewis' lead, but you can tell he's worried.

Ed (Jon Voight) is friends with Lewis and is the point of contact between Lewis and the others. On the surface, Ed questions why he goes on the trip. But we know. The connection between them is clear. Ed may not believe Lewis's bullshit, but he loves it. He doesn't understand why he loves it but follows it down into the abyss.

Drew (Ronny Cox) pulls his guitar out and plays a song. A boy on the porch plays along with him on his banjo. They switch off phrases with each other.

The camera gawks at the banjo-playing boy. It also sneaks a peak into someone's door so we can see the physically disabled child and assume inbreeding.

They visit a nearby family to inquire about driving their cars to the river's end for canoeing. Lewis is a dick to them, too.

On day one, Bobby rides with Lewis. Drew rides with Ed because he sees through Lewis's act and wants no part in it.

Lewis carries a bow-and-arrow with him to add to his perceived bravura. He wears a scuba vest that looks weird.

Lewis berates Bobby, treating him like shit the entire ride down. Bobby swallows it so he can be part of the gang.

Ed takes Lewis' bow to shoot a deer the following morning. His nerves shake, and he misses. Drew and Bobby can't understand why you'd want to kill an innocent animal.

Lewis is tired of Bobby, so Lewis tells Ed to take him in his canoe. Lewis and Drew are further back. Ed and Bobby stop on the side of the river to wait for them. In the woods, they see a couple of locals. One of them is carrying a shotgun.

Ed and Bobby don Southern accents and tell the locals they're canoeing  to Aintry. Locals inform them that the river doesn't go that way, suggesting they are lost. And with Lewis guiding them, that's a strong possibility.

Bobby, trying to be amicable, says that maybe they are. He tries to put on Lewis's peacocking, but it doesn't fit him.

The locals strap Ed by the neck to a tree.

They tell Bobby to strip naked. He tries to run away, but they pin him down and make him squeal like a pig. Then, they rape Bobby.

Ed sees Lewis and Drew coming down the river. Lewis sneaks up and shoots the rapist with an arrow. The other man drops his shotgun and runs into the woods.

The men debate their actions. Lewis has killed someone, a local. Would the local police side with them if they sought their help? And with what happened to Bobby, he wouldn't want it getting around, regardless.

Burt Reynolds is perfectly hateable. The audience is ready for his humbling within seconds of Lewis being on screen.

Jon Voight is amazing. He has the most complex characterization of anyone, so watching his struggle and where he lands is satisfying, even when his choices are disappointing.

Finishing this movie took me forever. I haven't seen this movie, but it's in the cultural consciousness. I used to work for a rafting company, booking tours in the main office. We'd give the visitors a map of how to get to the river. Part of our routine was to tell them the directions, which included, ""If you hear banjos, you've gone too far."" No one didn't get the ""joke.""

Also, no rafting company would let first-timers go down the Cahulawassee. Nor would they rent a canoe to anyone to go down it.

It's the cultural shock of witnessing a man raped in a mainstream movie that gave this movie its staying power. This movie has little to offer the contemporary audience, especially after the inciting incident. The story's setup leads to what comes next.

And it's pretty tedious.

<blockquote><i>Overshadowing the village of Vandor stands the Castle Borski. From the turn of the century, a monster from an ancient age of history came to live here. No living thing survived, and the spectre of death hovered in waiting for her next victim.</i></blockquote>

Bruno, an artist, makes sketches for a painting. His model is his girlfriend, Sascha, whom he promises to marry once he has money set aside. She says they cannot wait that long — she is pregnant with his baby. Bruno goes to her father.

Sascha chases after him into the night. Something happens, and her face breaks out in sores.

The following day, Dr. Namaroff (Peter Cushing) prepares for an autopsy. It is Sascha. She is the seventh unsolved murder in five years. The police hope it is not a serial killer, but they have no leads. They suspect Bruno, who is missing.

<blockquote><i>Don't use long words, inspector! They don't suit you.</i></blockquote>

While wheeling in Sascha's body, her hand breaks. Dr. Namaroff unveils the body to reveal that it has turned to stone.

The police scour the woods, looking for Bruno. They find him hanging, his face torn to ribbons. The trial suspects that Bruno killed Sascha, then himself. Professor Heitz, Bruno's father, knows about the other murders and can see through the scapegoating of his son.

Heitz meets Namaroff to discuss Megaera, one of the three gorgons whose eyes can turn someone into stone. Mythology heads will probably be confused, as Megaera is a fury, not a gorgon. Later, they will name Medusa and Tisiphone as the other gorgons, where Medusa is the only ""actual"" gorgon.

Namaroff encourages Heitz to leave. It feels like the entire village is protecting a secret. Heitz calls upon Professor Jules Heitz, his son, to aid him in her search for the truth.

At night, Heitz hears a song drawing him out — again, furies, not gorgons. I like how the score blends with the song, curving its mystery and foreboding. It draws him to Castle Borski, where a figure in green with snake-like hair appears before him. His face breaks into sores, and his skin turns white as he slowly turns to stone or gorgonized.

And so on.

The movie has the classic Hammer tone of British moderation. It doesn't have the total sense of dread that some of the Poe adaptations had, but it all comes together successfully. It's a cozy horror movie, which I always enjoy.

I love the castle set — full of cobwebs and ornate architecture.

This movie has that gothic dread that I love. Every moment feels like the worst could happen, if only... The music does a fantastic job of accenting innocent words with curiosity.

The sets are gorgeous. The baroness's castle is what I love — full of labyrinthine halls and decadence.

<blockquote><i>She reaches from beyond the grave
To make good men her wicked slaves
She’ll take your blood, she’ll take your head!
She’ll follow you until you’re DEAD!</i></blockquote>

Heather Watkins (Maya Hawke) works at B. Dalton’s, a bookstore in Shadyside Mall. The store closes, and she meets Ryan, an acquaintance who works in another store in the mall.

Before they can leave, she has some last duties to attend to. Someone in a skull mask sneaks up on her and tries to stab her. She runs to find Ryan in his store, starting a call to 911 on the store phone. But the killer catches up with her and stabs her. As Heather gropes out, she pulls off the killer’s mask. It’s Ryan.

Nick Goode, the town sheriff, arrives and shoots Ryan in the head. It’s too late for Heather.

This is the story of two towns: Sunnyvale and Shadyside. While Sunnyvale has had no violent crimes in 30 years, Shadyside has a long history of brutal murders. Newspapers refer to Shadyside as Killer Capital USA.

Deena Johnson (Kiana Madeira) tries to write a note to Sam. Sam, Deena’s ex-girlfriend, moved to Sunnyvale and remains closeted, leaving Deena feeling abandoned and alone.

Her brother, Josh, spends time on AIM (which didn’t exist until 1997, but whatever), researching other Shadyside killers in the town’s history. He believes a witch named Sarah Fier regularly possesses a resident to take revenge.

Deena is not on board with the “witch” theory. Her friends Simon and Kate are glib about the whole thing, thinking it’s all fun.

Everything comes to a head when, after a nasty fight between football rivals, the Shadyside Witches and the Sunnyvale Devils, teens from Sunnyvale follow the Witches’ school bus in their convertible and throw trash at the bus. Deena, seeing Sam in the passenger’s seat, becomes enraged. She asks Kate to help her grab the Gatorade cooler as they open the back of the bus.

Just before they throw it, Kate points out Deena’s bleeding nose. The cooler still fumbles from the back, colliding with the convertible, causing it to careen off the road.

The bus pulls over to the side of the road. Sam climbs out of the car, her nose bleeding like Deena’s. She has a vision — a kaleidoscope of images surrounding the witch — before Deena and her friends run up to help.

The film explores performative grief amid recurring tragedy, where teenagers are killing other teenagers, and the only solution seems to be candlelight vigils and prayers.

It also explores how lower-income neighborhoods receive substantially less support and how they blame the residents for the resulting conditions instead of the underfunded systems. Several Shadyside teens have to work double shifts, and others resort to drug dealing to have money to get by.

There’s a scene where a bunch of white people are sitting around watching Unsolved Mysteries while a guy in a skull mask chases the teens. It’s not subtle, but it doesn’t need to be.

The movie touches a little on the “doomed” generation mentality, which was especially prevalent in the 90s for queer kids (see the monumental 90s film <i>The Doomed Generation</i>). These issues still exist today, as most of us feel we have no future.

<blockquote><i>Another Shadyside tragedy. An underprivileged overachiever with bright prospects.</i></blockquote>

The gore is not pervasive, but when it shows up, it’s fucking brutal.

The movie also has its fair share of tropes and cliches. Its mythos is fun, though, and the buildup is enough to make the other two movies compelling prospects.

In the previous film, C. Berman told Deena that, despite what they thought, Sarah Fier would never stop coming after them. Sam gets possessed by the witch, and Deena and Josh restrain her. Deena promises Sam that she will get her back.

The sheriff left a note for someone saying, “It’s happening again.” We see that the note was for C. Berman.

C. Berman (Gillian Jacobs) lives a solitary life. Her home decor seems trapped in the 70s, and she keeps dozens of clocks, each with alarms for events like “Jeopardy,"" Dinner,"" or “Locks.” The “Dinner” alarm goes off, and she makes herself a microwave dinner and pours herself a Jim Beam on the rocks.

In the middle of the night, Deena and Josh come to Berman with Sam tied up in the trunk, begging for help. Though reluctant, Berman lets them in. C. Berman pulls out a book and a Polaroid of her and her sister, taken on July 12th, 1978 — one week before the Camp Nightwing massacre.

1978
Ziggy Berman (Sadie Sink) runs through the woods. Will puts his arm out and clotheslines her, giving her a bloody nose. A group of girls, led by Shiela, emerge. They string Ziggy up and try to burn her, but camp councilors arrive in time to stop them.

Cindy Berman (Emily Rudd) cleans the outhouse with her boyfriend, Tommy. Cindy is a do-gooder that the other councilors sort of hate. One of them comes to her to talk about Ziggy.

Ziggy goes to Nurse Lane’s cabin and finds a book with newspaper clippings about her daughter, Ruby Lane, and a drawing labeled “Witch’s Mark.”

Nurse Lane goes ham and tries to stab Tommy.

<blockquote><i>I’m sorry, I can’t save you. One way or another, you’re gonna die tonight.</i></blockquote>
The camp plays a game of capture the flag, Sunnyvale vs. Shadyside.

I don’t love camp movies, and I’m pretty bored with period movies set in the 70s.

Thankfully, the movie has a lot of witch lore to cover as well. We learn the answers to a trillion things that seem conveniently written or handed to the characters that would have been helpful for the kids in the first movie to know.

I was delighted to see Dylan Gage, who had a prominent role in Pen15.

Similar to 1994, this movie has period music. Most of it is conventional, but we get some Buzzcocks and Runaways. Also, covers in the first movie appear, such as Sweet Jane.

They use Carry On, Wayward Son twice — what is this, Supernatural?

The movie touches a bit on similar class issues from the first movie, but it's more in the background.

By the way, don't read a word of the Wikipedia pages for any of these movies — even their summaries are backfilled with things you learn later on.

My only gripe is that we're supposed to be told this story from C's point of view, but the story has an omnipresent third-person perspective to convey everything.

<blockquote><i>You do not summon the devil by chance. You must make a choice.</i></blockquote>
After uniting the hand with the body, Deena sees Sarah Fier's story from Sarah's point of view. The movie shifts characters from the 1994 story to the 1666 story.

Sarah helps a hog give birth. Her father is proud and expects good things for her — like marrying Solomon Goode.

Sarah relays a message to her friends for a gathering that evening. 

Sarah and a couple of others meet an exiled woman, Widow Mary. She has berries with euphoric qualities. Unverified stories of witchcraft surround her.

They go to Widow Mary's hut, but she isn't there. A crow stands near a box. Inside, a book with the witch's mark. Inside, spells and incantations that call on Satan and his demons.

Mary stops her and warns her that the devil lives in the book — that he is calling out to Sarah and that she best be careful.

They bring the berries to the gathering and eat them. Sarah and Hannah sneak off to have sex. A rustling in the woods — Mad Thomas spotted them.

The following morning. Hannah's father is behaving strangely. As though possessed. Sarah goes to Hannah's to help, but Hannah's mother catches them together. She forces Sarah out of the house.

<blockquote><i>God knows what you are.</i></blockquote>
The entire village hears. Now, Sarah's father is distant. All the food in the community is rotten and full of bugs. The mother pig has eaten all of her children.

The pastor Cyrus locks the children in the church with him. He ripped out both his eyes and the children's. Solomon kills Cyrus, but the town does not believe it is him alone.

The town suspects witchcraft.

This movie brings everything to a satisfying conclusion. They did the groundwork, and the payoff was satisfying.

Putting the actors we know in the 1666 roles, the culmination of everything has more impact — it feels like it acknowledges the through-line of the town's history.

At times, the vamping felt a little <i>Stranger Things</i>-ish, but not that bad.

Alas, no 17th-century needle drops. But some Pixies, which I dig.

Two mysteries are planted at the beginning of the story — the woman and the empty plane.

Guy Van Stratten, an American gambler and smuggler, tries to protect Jakob Zouk from murder. Jakob doesn't understand, so Guy tells him a story.

Guy and his girlfriend Mily witness a murder at night at the Naples harbor. The dying man, Brocco, whispers two names to Mily before he passes. One is Gregory Arkadin. The other, she can't remember. With the name Arkadin comes the promise of untold wealth.

Guy and Mily separately look for Mr. Arkadin, but Mr. Arkadin is a secretive and elusive man. Guy dates Arkadin's daughter, Raina, hoping to meet her father.

At a masquerade ball, Arkadin hands Guy a confidential report with Guy's name on it. Arkadin suspects Guy is a con looking to exploit his daughter. Guy claims to have dirt on Arkadin, which strikes his interest. Arkadin claims not to know his past. He hires Guy to find out who Arkadin is.

Thus begins the convoluted, cross-national narrative, wherein Guy follows lead after lead in search of Arkadin's identity.

Meanwhile, Mily becomes Arkadin's mistress.

Names pile onto names, and plots diverge into dead ends — Guy exhausts himself chasing a mystery with a grand promise at the end.

I watched The Comprehensive Version pieced together by The Criterion Collection. Nine versions of this movie exist (including one novelization), and this one has the most footage. Also, being re-edited by several folks, it's probably the most logically cohesive version of the movie.

Welles exiled himself so he could have creative freedom. He didn't finish this movie on time, and financers weren't going to wait around. Once again, he didn't get final cut, so he declared it a disaster.

Having seen the most complete version, it all fits together — it's still a mess.

The movie plays with dynamic camera angles and motion, sometimes to a distracting degree. Occasionally, the Dutch angles create captivating frames. More often, they're distracting.

Welles, whose fake beard and heavy makeup obscure any facial expression except an arched eyebrow, is flat. His accent is hammy, and his delivery of every line is so self-important.

The heavily dubbed dialogue pushes into itself — I couldn't tell if it was a clumsy Howard Hawks send-up or what.

Having only seen this version, I can't say what is Welles and what are reedits. Regardless, this isn't one I'd recommend.","criterion channel, cmc, cmc2016, criterion, film noir",2024-01-26

A group throws a surprise party in the park in Kentucky for professor and archeologist Dr. Garrett Williams.

Dr. Williams (William Marshall) expresses his desire to visit a cave in Nigeria, where the cult of the Yoruba deity, Eshu, practiced their rights. He declares Eshu the most powerful of all earthly deities. Eshu is a trickster god who creates chaos. Hence, people in the area attribute natural disasters to Eshu. Its symbol is the phallus.

Dr. Williams gets his wish and goes to an archeological dig in Nigeria. There, they find a box carved out of ebony depicting Eshu at the crossroads. He opens the box, unleashing a whirlwind that pins everyone against the cave walls. A green, smiling face flashes before them.

Meanwhile, in Louisville, Dr. Williams’s son, Emmett, and Emmett’s wife, Abby, move into a new home, paid for by the church as Emmett is the church’s pastor.

That night, a strong wind blows through the house, slamming doors and knocking furniture over.

The following morning, Abby hops into the shower. She experiences an unnatural ecstasy coming over her. Her silhouette behind the shower curtains grows.

Later, in the basement, Abby does laundry. The basement door slams shut. The room fills with wind. A grinning green face appears. Then, everything dies down.

Abby’s behavior grows erratic. While butchering a chicken, she turns the knife on herself and cuts down her forearm, licking her lips with an erotic intensity. She has a coughing fit in the church. Her voice changes when Emmett tries to start sex.

Did Eshu possess Abby? Or is this a devil in disguise?

Director William Girdler became known in exploitation circles for his mockbusters, making several of his movies box office successes, including <i>Abby</i>.

Warner Bros. sued American International after this came out. They claimed it was an <i>Exorcist</i> rip-off. The suit caused the film distribution to cease. The only available version of this movie is a digitally scanned 16mm print released in 2007.

The performances are all solid — William Marshall is charismatic and steals every scene he is in. While the script does not avoid Black stereotypes, it does not hang the story or characters directly on those stereotypes.

Also, the script is to the point. It knows you know the premise — it gives you all the information you need and sets everything into motion by the fifteen-minute mark.

Emmett and his family are all devout Christians. Even Emmett’s foreplay is quoting The Bible. So, their concept of an exorcism looks different from the Catholic one of <i>The Exorcist</i>. 

A remaster, or some distribution would garner more consideration for this movie than its reputation as a cheap knock-off. This isn’t a hidden masterpiece, but the film is better than I expected.","plex, hooptober, hooptober8.0, mockbusters, religious horror, blaxploitation",2024-01-27

A gnarl tree or structure supports an egg containing a creature with human hands and talons. Its closed eyes flutter.

A blonde man stands before an elaborate, abstract machine. He holds a cross-shaped gun.

From the sky descends a ball covered in statues in prayer. Altogether, it resembles an eye.

<blockquote><i>Who? Who are you?</i></blockquote>

A woman wakes up to a loud screech. Before her is a staircase. Beneath her, an egg. She ascends the stairs.

These tiny threads are our introduction to the world of <i>Angel's Egg</i>. It is a world of symbol and allegory threaded through dream logic. The result is somewhere between serene and nightmarish.

Its characters are unnamed — besides the two, their world appears unpopulated. Whether that is true is a matter of interpretation.

Their connection forms over the woman's egg. The man suggests she break it open, but she does not want to. Though she says she tells him not to follow her, she does not insist when he continues.

He tells a tragic Noah's Ark story. The people in the ark wait for the dove's return, forgetting the outside world, their pasts, and their destination.

<blockquote><i>The bird I saw — I can't even remember where or when. It was so long ago. Perhaps it was a dream.</i></blockquote>

I can enjoy dream logic/tonal movies so long as they sustain a thread to tether the viewer. At a lean 71 minutes, this movie spends just enough time in its slow-moving atmosphere. It never felt like it attempted to be experimental or artistic without reason.

This film is a collaboration between Bakshi and the renowned fantasy illustrator Frank Frazetta. Though the environment bears Frazetta's fingerprints, the rotoscoping animation reduces everyone to that lumpy, awkward Bakshi style.

The most exciting animations are the sick monster designs because they didn't rotoscope them.

Japanese streets blur by—images jitter and freeze. The experimental, distressed aesthetic, matched with the pumping electronic rock music, is peak early-2000s — think David Fincher on a shoestring budget.

Somewhere in Shinjuku, a pimp beats a sex worker bloody and rapes her. Ichi watches from the window, masturbating. The scene resolves on a dying plant on the porch drenched in cum. From the cum rises the title of the movie.

Jiji, a yakuza boss, calls for Ichi to make a hit. We later see Jiji's cleanup crew enter an apartment drenched in blood and littered with Anjo's organs. ""He did it again. Disgusting as ever,"" one of them says.

Anjo's faction arrives the next day in an empty, spotless apartment. Anjo is missing, as well as three million yen. Kakihara surveys the room. He has bleached blonde hair, scars across his face, and a Glasgow smile from which he exhales his cigarette smoke.

They decide that Anjo ran off with the money and a sex worker, but Kakihara doesn't believe that is Anjo's nature. He goes to the club to question folks. The boss's girl, Karen, assumes Anjo is dead. Jiji, posing as an elderly man, says he heard a rumor that Suzuki kidnapped Anjo.

So, Kakihari abducts and tortures Suzuki, suspending him from meat hooks and forcing needles in and out of him. When that doesn't work, he pours boiling oil on Suzuki's back and scalp. Finally, Suzuki's boss arrives to see what is happening and clear Suzuki's name. The boss demands money they don't have, so Kakihari cuts off the tip of his tongue to pay penance. He might have enjoyed it.

Following some leads, Kakihari finds one of Jiji's crew begging for heroin. He reveals Ichi was the killer. And that Kakihari is Ichi's next target.

The movie continues down the brutal train of sexualized violence, whether it be rape, sadomasochism, or slicing a guy in half and jerking off to it.

Initially, I believed this was another movie that I should have watched in high school if I wanted the full impact. That said, I'm glad I watched it now, where the CG and gore have aged, so it's not quite as scarring. It's still gonzo splatter and gross.

Before watching the movie, I thought Kakihari was Ichi since his face was on all the posters and promotional material. Putting Ichi in his ""1"" costume would likely draw fewer audiences.

While Kakihari seems comfortable with his sexual violence, Ichi is at odds with his behavior. We don't understand why Ichi does any of it except for a memory of bullying and rape, which Jiji exploits to coerce Ichi to kill for him.

When Ichi isn't killing or visiting brutalized sex workers, he plays Tekken Tag Tournament as though it is his rest.

<blockquote><i>The same as ever.</i></blockquote>

The movie sometimes feels like it has something to say — Takeshi, the child Ichi accidentally defends, is a catalyst for someone who thirsts for revenge. He has no other example of how to handle the bullying he experiences except violence.

Throughout the film, characters who seem level-headed break out into violence, not knowing any other way to process their feelings.

<blockquote><i>There's no love in your violence.</i></blockquote>

Like most media that portrays sadomasochism, it removes consent and distorts it into mere misogyny. But here, I think it's intentional. Because, despite the tools that Kakihari uses, he is not practicing S&M — the pleasure is one-sided. He wants reciprocation, but nobody can meet him on his terms. Also, Ichi's programming makes him confused about what consent means, culminating in him trying to conclude that because someone doesn't want to be raped, they must want to be raped. Ichi believes that's what he wants, too. Ultimately, he only kills.

The movie's comedic moments are unexpected. Jiji removing his clothes, and his face is superimposed on a bodybuilder? I've seen movies that use absurd gore to make it comedic. If this movie wants any of its gore to be funny, the intense and disturbing tone gets in its way.

The film's biggest weakness is its pacing. It has a lot of… everything that it wants to put in the movie. It doesn't know how to make it flow together. So, when they introduced the twins 80 minutes into the movie, I was over it. I stuck it through, and it had enjoyable moments.

Like, I think it's clever how Kakihari fetishizes Ichi — how he imagines something somehow worse than him that can finally inflict the amount of violence on him he desires. The ending is near perfect.

<blockquote><i>I really want to lose myself in despair.</i></blockquote>

There's a brilliant movie buried in here. If the movie were 80 minutes (really, if it were <i>Riki-Oh</i>) I might have loved it.","tubi, hooptober, hooptober8.0, j-horror, yakuza",2024-01-28

In her first American film, Audrey Hepburn is Princess Ann, who is on a goodwill tour of Europe to solidify her royal family's relationships with the Western European nations. We join her at her country's embassy that evening at a formal reception and ball given in her honor.

By all appearances, she is unphased by the laborious tour and the countless aristocrats with whom she has met. But we get a small glimpse as she pulls her foot out of her heel and stretches.

While Ann lies in bed, her assistant goes over the following day's events. Ann snaps and cries. They send for a doctor to make sure she is calm. The doctor gives her a sedative and suggests ""she do what she pleases for a while.""

Once everyone leaves, Ann gets dressed and slips out, hiding in a delivery truck.

Meanwhile, an American reporter named Joe (Gregory Peck) leaves a poker game to get some sleep before meeting the princess tomorrow. He comes across Ann asleep on a park bench. He doesn't recognize her as the princess and thinks she's drunk. Joe tries to get her a taxi, but when she gives the correct address, he assumes Ann is confused. After much hassle and confusion, Joe brings her to his place to sleep off the alcohol.

Joe wakes up late the next day for his interview. He rushes to work, only to hear that the princess is ill. He looks at the newspaper, and the picture looks awfully familiar. Joe suggests to his boss that he can land an exclusive interview with the princess. The princess, however, has different plans.

<blockquote><i>— Don't you have to work?
— Work? No! Today's a holiday.</i></blockquote>Both Peck and Hepburn are charming and funny. They have fantastic chemistry.

The camera finds all the perfect angles. It never feels composed. It feels like perfect timing.

The film has a laid-back, breeze pace. Nothing happens quickly. Even with police involvement, the stakes remain low.

This movie is the foundation for the contemporary romantic comedy, complete with innuendos, manipulation, and misunderstandings.

Most of the ""tourism rom-coms"" that followed did little riffing on this formula. The romance developed so organically that it completely took me in.

This movie is such a genuine delight. What an achievement! Can William Wyler do any wrong? Between this and <i>The Heiress</i>, he keeps exceeding my expectations.

<b>Class conscious or class clown? Why not both?</b>

<i>Turin, late 1800s</i>
From 5:30 AM until 8:30 PM, textile factory workers toil tirelessly. Near the end of the day, fatigue causes a worker to drift off, resulting in a machine accident that mangles his hand.

While visiting the hospital and gathering donations for his family, some workers form a committee and make a case for shorter hours. The management warns them against saying such things, as the boss might fire them if he heard them.

So, they decide they need collective action to make their point. They try walking out an hour early but fumble it. 

While trying to think of another strategy, Professor Sinigaglia, a professor and labor activist, encourages them to escalate into a full-blown strike.

Despite a couple of outliers, the remaining group agrees. The professor helps them prepare and to understand the weight of what they're doing. They will suffer financial loss and exile from their neighborhood suppliers. It will take all of them working together to survive.

Perhaps none of this sounds like a comedic farce to you. It didn't to me, either. But this is a complex work with several historical forces intervening to motivate this odd film.

<i>Turin, 1962</i>
Ninety thousand workers went on strike against harsh factory conditions and poor pay. The situation escalated when a right-wing union, UIL, incited a riot in Piazza Statuto. Though the strikers occupied the factory during part of it, the changes to policy were minimal.

What changed, however, was the increased education and awareness of workers.

The 1963 film mirrored the strike in a 19th-century context, emphasizing the political defeat and rising workers' awareness.

Director Mario Monicelli and writers Age & Scarpelli saw the writing on the wall. They had a historical vision of what loss looks like.

By 1968, a wave of worker and student protests broke out in Italy, lasting for years. By the early 1970s, conditions for workers significantly improved.

Where is the comedy in this story? The comedy isn't in the story but in its characters. The titular organizer, Professor Sinigaglia, epitomizes this. Though eloquent and grave, he is also an imperfect human character.

<i>A Comedy of Errors</i>
After giving the speech that motivated the workers to strike, he finds a sandwich one worker left behind. He unwraps it to eat it. The worker returns for his sandwich. The professor silently wraps up and returns the sandwich. The professor is surprised, but he is not ashamed.

The professor is a runaway criminal who forsakes his family and occupation. Yes, he loves helping the workers organize. He also loves sex workers. He is a human, not an ideal.

Other characters also exhibit these ""flaws"" of character that cut into the weight at odd angles. For today's audience, it won't be a laugh riot. The jokes are there all the same.

And so, the movie comes together in a nuanced and faulty way. It matches moments of beauty — the black-and-white cinematography and period-accurate sets and clothing are masterful — with moments of humanity.

This movie embraces tragedy with its comedy instead of using comedy solely as a coping mechanism.

As an experiment, it doesn't work. The ending feels unexpected and more depressing than the material suggests.

But it is still a fascinating attempt.","criterion channel, criterion, criterion challenge 2024, solidarity",2024-01-29

A pool full of human parts — replicas. A psychiatrist can create fingers, faces, or anything requested.

<blockquote><i>Inferiority complexes dig holes in the psyche, and I fill them in.</i></blockquote>

Okuyama experiences an explosion during an industrial accident at work. The explosion covers his face with burns. He wears bandages to hide them despite his wife suggesting otherwise. He becomes hostile and obsessed with faces and attraction.

<blockquote><i>— I feel as if I've been buried alive.
— You closed the door yourself. No one's stopping you from getting out.</i></blockquote>

As he looks out the window, the exterior resembles an eyeball, with vascular trees reaching from the corners into a bloodshot sky. The light from the fireplace flickers like TV static against his bandaged face.

Okuyama visits his boss and requests time off. His boss reminds Okuyama that he offered it before, and Okuyama refused it, so of course, it's okay.

<blockquote><i>— I want time to figure out for myself whether I'm really qualified to stay on here.
— You're the same person. What's there to figure out?</i></blockquote>

Okuyama goes to see the psychiatrist, who proposes an experimental mask. The problem is — the mask may change Okuyama's personality and mannerisms. Okuyama agrees, turning his life into an experiment wherein he lives life as both himself and as a different person.

Alongside Okuyama's story, we follow a Hibakusha woman with scars on her neck and cheek. She works in a psychiatric ward with WWII veterans. She wears her hair in a way that obscures her scars, feeling like they isolate her. Her story is smaller, and her arc is more familiar.

The woman is Okuyama's opposite, the Jekyll to his Hyde. Okuyama is self-centered, manipulative, and childish, whereas she is giving, caring, and forthright. It is so stark that it clarifies what the movie thinks of Okuyama — there is no pity or understanding. Everyone close to him allowed him to carry on living. It was he who claimed to be a monster, and he who became one.

Another way the movie reflects his selfishness is how none of the characters have names except for him. Their names aren't meaningful to him — only their function in relationship to him.

The predominant theme of the movie is that everything is a masquerade. Everyone pretends, and everyone has multiple selves that appear for their audiences. His wife talks about makeup and how women feel as though they are unpresentable without makeup.

<blockquote><i>I have so many selves, I can't even contain them all.</i></blockquote>

The film itself is aware of the superficial nature of its story. There are moments when the movie becomes more artificial. At times, the background noise fades, and the lights dim, focusing solely on the psychiatrist and Okuyama. When he worries the super's daughter will blow his cover, he gives a ""yikes"" face to the camera.

The psychiatrist is the unnecessary monologue, making subtext text. He wants Okuyama to be open and share everything so his contribution is meaningful. His office is a strange void, an in-between state. The world around it is surreal. At one point, a door opens, and it looks like hair underwater is overtaking it. At another, we can see a soundtrack musician in the background, playing the non-diegetic music.

We only see Okuyama's true face at oblong angles or through distorted glass, rendering him unknowable to the audience.

Scenes repeat in blocking and framing that Okuyama experienced as himself in bandages and as his new persona. Others repeat as inversions, as though looking inside the mask. Scenes tear at the edges, and light from nowhere leaks in — the audio clips and distorts as though consuming itself.

The soundtrack is discordant, distant, alienating. It soaks in darkness, tingeing every moment.

This film is one of the few experimental films I've seen that maintains a coherent narrative structure. Anyone who watches this could tell you what happened. Yet, many images and moments enhance the strangeness and pull at the seams.

<blockquote><i>Every year thousands of people come to Hollywood to pursue their dreams. Some succeed. Some move back home… And some just disappear.</i></blockquote>Daisy (Sheri Moon Zombie) returns to her apartment inside the Lusman Arms, a renovated hotel. Once home, she pours a glass of wine, checks her messages, and changes into a robe. A man in black, wearing a balaclava, forcefully smashes the door with a hammer. He pins Daisy down and beats her skull with the hammer's back.

In another apartment, Nell (Angela Bettis) laments to her husband, Steven, about their new place. Nothing works. The walls are paper thin, and it's hard to tell who is fighting, fucking, or practicing lines. Byron, the building manager, tries to answer questions but dodges all complaints, saying to send those to Ned, the on-premise maintenance worker. He also shows them the intercom system that can reach the doorman anytime. Byron shows them some unique architectural elements, including strange plaques with mysterious runes.

Nell runs into Ned, who the movie wants us to think is the killer. She also meets Chas, an older man who has lived in the building since 1947. Chas knows the man who built the hotel and tells Nell about his mysterious disappearance.

Nell finds a small box with another symbol on it. Inside are human teeth. Strange noises come through the intercom system. Nell hears screaming and calls the police. The killer used a nail gun to attack the woman next door. However, when the police arrive, they find the apartment empty, leading them to dismiss the situation.

The mystery deepens when Nell discovers a note instructing her to check room 504. For one, there is no room 504.

<blockquote><i>It's not about what gets in — it's about what's already here</i></blockquote>I have not seen the original <i>Toolbox Murders</i> from 1978, but I assume it is very similar in tone to this movie, considering this feels like a '70s throwback. But that's not a bad thing. It's cozy with its familiarity.

Angela Bettis is always fully dedicated, so her energy is essential to this movie's charm.

The gore is brutal and effective without feeling too indulgent.

The metaphor isn't brilliant — Hollywood consumes the people who can't make it — but the movie doesn't ""hammer"" it home (pun intended).

The third act gets clunky in how it fits together. It bothered me initially, but it gets so silly that it's hard not to laugh.

This movie is well-paced, decently acted, and has several of my favorite horror elements. Sure, we've seen it before, but it's difficult to dislike when it works so well.

2024-02-01,All of Us Strangers,2023,https://boxd.it/5JCOWP,3.5,,"Adam (Andrew Scott) leads a solitary life in his high-rise apartment in London. We catch him at his computer working on a script. One night, the fire alarm goes off, and he evacuates. No one else is on the street except him. Looking up at the building, he sees only two lights: his and a stranger's.

When Adam goes back upstairs, he receives a knock on the door. There at the door is his neighbor, Harry (Paul Mescal). Harry flirts with Adam, asking to come in. Adam declines the offer and goes back to smoking weed.

As Adam works on his script, he looks through his childhood items: family photos, a tree ornament, and so on. He finds a picture of his childhood home.

Adam takes the photo to his hometown outside of London and finds the home. He walks past, seeing a child in the window. He goes into a field nearby and breathes in the air. When he opens his eyes, the sky has grown darker. Behind him, a man gestures for Adam to follow him. While initially it looks like cruising, we realize that this is Adam's father and is taking Adam home to see his mother.

Adam's mother and father died when he was a child.

The next time Adam sees Harry, they talk, and Adam takes a chance to invite Harry into his life.

The film explores how trauma locks parts of us into certain times in our lives. Some parts of us still believe we are the child who lost their parents and would do anything to show them who we've become.

Andrew Scott is on screen almost the entire movie, and he brings such emotional depth to his character. While some of it is in the script, much is Scott's contribution. Please, please, please let him lead more things. He is a beautiful actor in every sense of the word.

Paul Mescal is also very good. He is the master of micro-expressions and camera perception. <i>Normal People</i> fans/trauma bonds know.

Both of them have great on-screen chemistry, and it's delightful to watch them romantically fuck each other. If nothing else, that's worth the price of admission.

The music is fucking incredible, but cloying and on-the-nose. Like most queer boys, I love the Pet Shop Boys. But having his mom sing ""Always on My Mind"" to him is…

The magic of Adam seeing his parents again never gets (or needs) an explanation. It reminds me of <i>Petite Maman</i>, but the concept strains a bit more in this story. As it switches between Harry and the parents, two different ideas are at play. When the movie tried to resolve the difference, it lost me.

This script is a personal one and one written during the quarantine. At points, you get the sense that Andrew Haigh is putting his traumas on the page — at other times, it feels like a period on an unfinished sentence.

Many people will connect to the movie. About 2/3 of the film had me hooked. I really like this movie. It does a lot very well. The trip to the end, however, is divisive and will affect people differently. For me, it was enough to keep me from loving it.","amc southpoint, owen",2024-01-31

Isaac Hendrix (Glynn Turman) is a college football player studying law. In the evenings, he drives a taxi. His wife, Christella (Joan Pringle), supports him wholeheartedly.

They go out with friends for a night on the town. They go to a strip club and a hypnotist. Isaac ends up on stage. The hypnotist suggests they are in a cold place. Isaac freezes up. His eyes grow stoic. He's in the meat locker. He sees Betty Jo's murder.

The next day, he goes out and buys a fedora — Christella knows that isn't his style, but she questions it, and Isaac snaps at her. He takes the hat back to the bedroom. In the mirror reflection, we see the face of JD. Not his reflection, but something within.

Isaac takes on JD's habits. He gambles and drives like a maniac. He says weird shit in bed like, ""I'm gonna take you on a long ride"" and ""Daddy's doing you good, baby"" (but I guess he is better at sex?).

As JD takes control, he changes his clothes and his hair. He beats Christella. JD seeks the man who killed his sister. He finds him through the killer's brother, the radio preacher Elijah Bliss (Louis Gossett Jr.).

Meanwhile, Christella's ex-husband, a cop, decides that it's time to fuck Ike up for what he's doing to Christella.

Glynn Turman is hamming it up for most of the movie. The film treats Ike and Christella's relationship seriously, so the silly premise has trouble balancing that with the complex relationship issues.

They also flashback to the murder scene way too often. This movie could be a solid 80 minutes and would feel much tighter.

When he returns home, a French woman lies bathing in his tub — real classy, Amicus. He kicks her out so that he can dissolve the remaining flesh attached to the skull.

Chris Maitland (Peter Cushing) and Matthew Phillips (Christopher Lee) attend an auction at Marco's antiquities shop. Chris is a writer of the occult, intent on disproving their spurious claims.

<blockquote><i>— The unknown is always intriguing.

Chris later visits Matthew and learns that not only did Marco steal it from Matthew, but Matthew is glad to be rid of it. Because of his curiosity, Chris experiences the power of the skull.

Based on ""The Skull of the Marquis de Sade,"" by Robert Bloch, this movie is Amicus' first full-length movie, one of a handful they attempted to compete with Hammer. Milton Subotsky, one of the Amicus co-founders, wrote the script. Freddie Francis insisted on rewriting it himself.

This movie was pretty dull, even by Amicus's standards. The plot is repetitive, and I didn't care why things happened. They didn't have a premise that worked for a full-length movie, so they pad it with Cushing scenery chewing — not inherently awful — just not a fix for this movie's problems.

The filmmaking is solid, and the performances are competent. I don't think this one will stick out in my mind.

Tracy walks barefoot down a storm drain into a cave. She witnesses an Aboriginal man dancing in front of a fire. He growls, turning to show his face — a skull. He hands her a stone. She wakes up. She's still holding the stone from her dream.

The next day, Tracy rides to school with Matt and Gail. Tracy brings the stone to school. Her teacher, Mrs. Millhouse, tells her it is a kadaicha stone — an Aboriginal stone that the shaman would give a tribe member who broke tribal laws. The stone condemned the offender to death.

That night, as Tracy walks home across the park, a wild dog emerges and tears her throat out. Gail and her father, Alex, find her body.

One by one, teens have the same dream and receive kadaicha stones. What do they all have in common? Alex is a property developer, and they all live in his new housing development.

The movie combines <i>The Amityville Horror</i> ""Built on Sacred Burial Grounds"" and <i>Nightmare on Elm Street</i> ""Dream Killer"" with an Australian twist.

The didgeridoo in the score hints at danger

The production value is pretty good for how low-budget this is. The filmmakers knew what they could accomplish, and they stuck within their means

I also appreciate the effort the movie makes to convey that it isn't Aboriginal people doing the killing — it's a curse that the Aboriginals are trying to warn the white kids about.

The lead-up to the end gets a little repetitive as it goes to the finale — a few too many ""How could you dad?"" scenes and whatnot.

Butler has asked lawyer John Carter to sell the house. Carter goes to the house with his mistress, Ingrid. He sells it to the town for a pittance. When he tells them he's staying at the Butler house, they try to offer him any other option, but he declines.

While John is away, someone kills a dog and sneaks into the house. When John and Ingrid go to bed, they sneak in with an axe and chop them up. They then read a passage from the Bible and leave a crucifix at the scene of the crime.

Jeffrey makes it to the house, but it's locked up. He goes to the mayor's and meets Diane, the mayor's daughter. She tells him about a strange call — that someone named Marianne is waiting for him.

The town holds dark secrets. The Butler mansion is at the heart of it.

The movie has small documentary touches — the narration, the still photos, and audio samples — but doesn't pretend to be a documentary.

It takes its time to get to anything. It's nearly 40 minutes in before we meet our leads. There's also a whole cast of townspeople that need to be killed.

The narrator, Diane, does most of the explaining, reading, and thinking about things she finds. Wilfred does the rest once someone finds his diary.

It's all so convoluted. The story, as it's structured, isn't a movie. With all the narration, it should've been a written story.

I was never super invested beyond wanting to know who the killer was. By the time it came around, it didn't matter.

A mother and her daughter, Albrun, live in the 15th-century Austrian Alps, 100 years after the black plague. They are goat herders who live on the outskirts of town.

Outside their house, masked figures holding torches stand a few yards from the house. The mother slips back inside. Immediately, rattles and knocks against the walls. Torchlight passes through every window.

<blockquote><i>You should be burned down, you witch. We’ll get you.</i></blockquote>The following day, the mother and Albrun gather limbs for the fire. The mother, horrified, looks around before feinting into the snow. She’s grown sick — growths cover her body reminiscent of several plagues.

Over the following days, her condition deteriorates. As Albrun has her first period, her mother tries to SA Albrun before running outside. Albrun finds her dead in the woods.

<i>15 Years Later
</i>
Albrun tends to her goats and has a confusing, possibly sexual relationship with them. She has a baby daughter of her own, but no father to the child that we know.

A woman named Swinda shows an unusual kindness to Albrun. Swinda comes to her home and asks her to come see the priest with her.

They enter an ossuary. The priest talks of filling people with light and scrubbing the village of sacrilege. He holds her mother's skull, polished with roses painted on it.

He gives it to Albrun with a warning against embracing the darkness. Albrun places the skull in the corner of her cottage.

The movie is a portrait of an abused and traumatized woman who is deeply isolated. Whether or not darkness lurks in the woods isn't important to her experience — only that she believes it and succumbs to it.

The landscape is beautiful and bitter — a land where the line between peace and violence is invisible. Shooting on location does loads for the atmosphere.

The film feels serene until abject horror bleeds in. Sometimes, scenes have an unknowable dread to them — we feel like something bad will happen, but we can’t point to any reason.

The bass in this is insane — I had to nearly turn it off to keep my house from shaking. When the score isn’t playing, the sound of the wind is the only thing heard most of the time. Lines of dialogue are few.

A lot of puking in this one, so be warned.

Overall, this film is devastating and melancholic. Unbelievable that this is a student film.

<i>Hoffman Boardinghouse, Sept 18, 1972</i>
Dr. Hoffman and his wife, leading authorities on telekinesis and the occult, are found dead on the night of their 16th-anniversary party

Their 13-year-old daughter, Debbie, witnessed their double suicide and had a nervous breakdown. The state submits her to a sanitarium

The couple who buys the house dies as well — Mr. Clark falls into his pool and drowns. Mrs. Clark puts her hand in the garbage disposal.

Hernan Royce buys the house and falls down the stairs

In 1982, we join Herman's nephew, Jim (director John Wintergate), who inherits the house. He puts an ad in the paper for young, single women to move in. He imagines women in his hot tub ripping each other's bikinis off.

Six women move into the boardinghouse. Later,  a British woman named Debbie begs to move in.

Coincidence?? No, it's Debbie Hoffman.

What do you think is going to happen?

This movie is shameless with how many excuses it finds for nudity. It makes Evil Toons look tasteful by comparison.

Wintergate's wife, Kalassu, who plays Victoria, gets the lion's share of lines and scenes. Besides Wintergate, of course, who plays two parts and credits himself under an alias for the second.

It's so hard to evaluate SOV movies. They make it clear just how much 35mm helps a film without any effort on their part.

I love it when they use every video effect they can for no reason.

That said, this is dog shit. It cuts or fades mid-dialogue, and its B-roll is But, it's so funny (unintentionally) and weird (maybe intentionally), so I had fun.

I also had a glass of wine, so who knows?

<blockquote><i>There's something dirty about death
</i></blockquote>Professor Farrell attends a private island retreat hosted by industrialist George Stark. 

The first night, Marie removes her sequenced dress and dances on the furniture. George ties her up. Everyone grabs a knife. The lights go out. When they come back on, someone has stabbed Maria.

She laughs, and everyone else joins in. It was all a prank.

As they spend time together, the professor learns the reason for his invitation — these wealthy people want to buy his new formula. They're all willing to pay a pretty penny. Some might go so far as to kill for it.

To keep the professor from leaving, George sends the motor launch away. So, when Jill finds the body of George's manservant, Charles, on the beach, they have no choice but to keep an eye on each other.

As the body count rises, the suspect list shrinks. And this is giallo, baby —  it's never as simple as it seems.

Bava knew this was an <i>And Then There Were None</i> rip-off and tried to change it up, but his involvement was so last-minute that he couldn't do much.

The story is pretty threadbare and hard to invest in, but it all moves along well enough

Rapid zooms and pulls, elegant blocking and compositions — Bava never turned in a bad-looking movie when he handled the cinematography. The sniper rifle scene looks stellar!

The movie has an overt lesbian relationship, which is neat, even though they have to hide it and deal with terribly misogynistic men, even by giallo standards.

Edwige Fenech is in the giallos with the wordiest titles. She's always great.

One night, a man covered in hair enters a watermill near Zarožje, where Vule works and sleeps. It leaps on Vule, baring its fangs, and bites into Vule's neck, killing him. Vule is the fourth miller to die that year.

Meanwhile, many desire Živan's beautiful daughter, Radojka, referring to her as a she-butterfly. Radojka is in love with Strahinja. They would like to marry, but Živan rejects Strahinja for being poor.

So, Strahinja travels to the neighboring village of Zarožje and becomes their new miller. Strahinja sleeps in the mill's attic and thereby avoids the attack from the hairy man.

The following day, he describes the attacker to the villagers. They know who it is — Sava Savanović, the infamous vampire. With this knowledge, they look for a way to stop him.

Radojka and Strahinja still meet in private. But her demeanor changes when something lures her into the woods.

<i>Leptirica</i>, or She-Butterfly, is the first Serbian horror film, even if writer/director Kadijević doesn't believe it is horror. The line between horror and fantasy is always blurry in folklore with monsters.

Sava Savanović is a legend in Serbian folklore. They consider him the first vampire, originating in the 17th century. In the lore, a vampire can take the form of a butterfly. Hence, the title's dual meaning.

Vampire bites in this movie aren't the two neck pricks we know — it's a hole burrowed into the chest.

The filmmaking is competent, even if the story barely knows what to do with its one-hour runtime. The movie isn't essential watching, but worthwhile for vampire or horror enthusiasts.","shudder, hooptober, hooptober7.0, vampires, folk horror: a study",2024-02-04

<blockquote><i>She's a phony. But she's a real phony.</i></blockquote>This movie is the story of Holly Golightly (Audrey Hepburn), a woman who ran away from her past to live in New York and pretend to be rich. She earns money from ""charming"" men, wears opulent clothes, and has a delightful cat named Cat. Whenever she has the opportunity, she loves to browse the selection at Tiffany's, especially with breakfast first thing in the morning.

One day, a poor writer named Paul moves into her building. But Paul is a kept man whose interior designer pays him for ""services rendered.""

When Holly's past comes looking for her, Paul learns the truth. While Holly wants to marry rich, Paul falls for her.

I don't know how many people I've known in my life who modeled their entire personality on Audrey Hepburn's performance in this movie.

The first 40 minutes of the movie is another dull satire — taken wholesale from Capote's book. Once the movie gives that up, it becomes watchable, albeit not terribly interesting.

The rest of the movie plays find and replace with various romance tropes. The pieces don't connect smoothly, so the emotional beats arrive at the right time but lack coherence.

Rooney claimed until his death that no one voiced any complaints about Mr. Yunioshi, but he wouldn't have a conception of it being a problem if someone hadn't mentioned it. He is constantly on screen.

The color is lovely, though!

Overall, I like the movies that this influenced more than the movie itself. For that reason, I'm glad it exists.

Pickett Smith (Sam Elliott) rides through the swamp in a canoe, taking pictures of the wildlife — lizards, crocodiles, and FROGS (as the title card says). The churning soundtrack suggests danger at every corner.

As he makes his way onto the lake, Clint Crocket and his sister, Karen, motorboat past Pickett, accidentally flipping over his canoe. They pick him up and tow his canoe to the dock.

Jason Crocket (Ray Milland) watches from the yard with his binoculars, angry at Pickett for intruding and for ""illegally"" taking pictures on his land. Still, Clint and Karen invite Pickett to lunch.

The vibration of frogs generates a steady din as they walk the Crocket estate. Jason has sent Grover out to take care of the exploding population. Pickett assures them it's natural for frogs to have these seasons and that they should be gone by next year. But the family is impatient, unable to sleep.

Jason asks Pickett to see if he can get in touch with Grover. Jason offers Pickett a gun to take. Picket scans Jason's animal trophies — lion heads and whatnot — and says,

<blockquote><i>No, sir, I don't think a stuffed bullfrog would add a thing.</i>

Back in the swamp, Pickett finds dead animals — birds, frogs, and snakes every few feet. Pickett finds a Jeep out there, along with Grover's dead body. He turns it over to find Grover's face torn into and rotted.

When Pickett reports back to Jason, they hear thumps outside. Massive frogs slap against the window.

The film is an unsubtle antipollution film and more than hints at the rich's role in it:

<blockquote><i>— Karen: You make us sound like the worst of the ugly rich.
— Jason: We are the ugly rich.
— Iris: Well, we're entitled to be ugly, Karen. God knows we pay enough taxes. Daddy, did you know the government is forcing us to put strainers on the paper mill?
— Jason: It's called antipollution control, Iris.
— Iris: Oh, what's the difference what it's called? It costs millions. And our dividends will be shot to hell.</i></blockquote>

When Pickett and Jason try to come up with a solution, Pickett states the thesis of the movie:

<blockquote><i>— I'm sure I can get the state to spray some pesticides.
— Yes, sir, I'm sure you can. You can kill a hell of a lot of other things, too.
— Mr. Smith, that is where you and I part company. I still believe man is master of the world.
— Does that mean he can't live in harmony with the rest of it?
— You call that horrible racket out there harmonious?
— Mr. Crockett, I know it sounds strange as hell but what if nature were trying to get back at us?</i></blockquote>

The interpersonal drama isn't all that interesting but reinforces the selfish, self-involved nature of the Crocket family. It feels a bit like diet Succession.

The movie has terrific animal footage, so if you like cute little reptile guys, there's a lot here for you.

This isn't brilliant, and often silly, but it knows what it's doing.

The Osage Nation discovers oil on their land during the annual flower moon. The white residents witness their ascent as the wealthiest people in the USA.

Ernest Burkhart returns from WWI. He does not go back home to his family but to live with his brother Bryon and uncle William Hale. The Osage considers William a friend for how much money he has given the community and for speaking their language.

William exerts a powerful influence on Ernest, who trusts others.

Ernest drives a cab and meets Molly Kyle, an Osage woman. The two fall in love and marry.

Someone murders several wealthy Osage. William reminds Ernest that Molly has headrights and that they should stay in the family. One by one, members of Molly's family die around her. Ernest's knowledge is a fraction of his involvement in the scheme.

The movie has multiple agendas: introduce the audience to the Osage people and their history around oil, acquaint the audience with several townspeople, and faithfully tell the true story of the Osage murders.

As a result, we get a 3.5-hour movie that has trouble rectifying the thematic content, the storytelling, and the faithfulness to the story's truth.

Releasing this as a miniseries would eliminate any arguments over the length.

But Scorsese is anti-miniseries, so we have this tome of a movie.

Around an hour in, you understand the situation. By the second hour, you're convinced the story concludes. Around the third hour, you get déjà vu as you watch conversations and tragedies replicate. Beyond a story or thematic necessity, we watch a play-by-play of the chess pieces.

The story itself feels vital, so I'm glad that the movie exists so that the story can be told. I am also glad it has AppleTV money so that it can look this nice.

The movie has some stylistic flourishes that I like, even if they're not always tonally consistent. For example, the Lucky Strike stage play ending, while well done, gives the grim story a weirdly comic ending.

The killings are shocking, but the style and framing resemble <i>Goodfellas</i>. Most of this movie feels like <i>Goodfellas'</i> second half. I'm the guy who has only seen <i>Goodfellas</i> and this movie.

DiCaprio is good, but his fake teeth and shaky accent only detract from the story. Also, De Niro looks and sounds like De Niro, so I don't feel like I see a character. Scorsese needs new actors to make another great movie.

Lily Gladstone is incredible, so I'm excited to watch more with her.

In a lesser hand, this would be abysmal. Here, the filmmakers achieve something that works, considering everything. To do honor to this story, Scorsese shouldn't have made such a lengthy film. This movie might end up like <i>The Irishman</i> — once it leaves theaters, nobody will watch it.","evo, jim, adam, good for her, edited by women",2024-02-06

Professor Wittembach, a priest, prays to God for protection from sin and temptation at his journey's start. He is going to a remote village, where he will observe and document their customs.

He stays with Count Michał Szemiot, who opens his library to Wittembach. In it are rare books — some that Witrembach thought did not exist.

The Count has sequestered his mother, The Countess, to an isolated part of the castle, saying she has gone mad. Wittembach witnesses the live-in physician, Doctor Froeber, dipping the mother in a cage into the lake to tire her out.

The doctor relays the story of how the Countess went mad because of a bear attack that killed her husband and traumatized her. After she gave birth to the Count, she became convinced that the Count was not human.

The village believes the Count is a half-human child of the bear that attacked the Countess.

The movie is a slow burn, feeling close to a Hammer gothic film but less tense.

I appreciate the overall ambiguity of the story, but it reached a point where it either needed to end sooner or make a choice. It did neither.

In the right frame of mind, I could enjoy this more, but I found this a little too lacking for me to love.

Straight away, this doesn't need to be seven hours. Halving this would still maintain the impact. Abel Gance was interested in more than telling the story but in pushing the creative limits of film to express complex emotional states. This movie is a lengthy meditation on love, grief, and family's meaning.

While the story is familiar and pretty lame, — ""she's adopted, so we fell in love with her, oops!"" — the movie does not reward those feelings or encourage their expression.

Everyone is doing 1920s acting, so the displays of emotion are broader than we're used to, but each actor finds moments for subtler performances that I appreciated.

The film has incredible and dynamic cinematography. The cuts come fast, and the camera moves within and throughout the set pieces. Silhouettes and vignetting ensure only the crucial aspects of a scene come through.

The lighting is so impressive! They do so much with the face, even on extensive sets. It required such meticulous blocking and attention to detail.

The film heavily uses juxtaposition. For example, a slow train might cross-fade to a snail superimposed on the tracks. Or, when Elie and Norma first meet, it cross-cuts between them playing and a dog and cat play-fighting. One of my favorites is when Sisif goes to get a palm reading, and scenes from later in the film project onto his hand.

Several scenes have little touches of painted-in color, like the green light on the train or the red stop sign. In a later segment, a ballroom gets several colors, creating a kinetic scene.

While some text cards have imagery behind them, some use moving abstract textures. It's so gorgeous!

This film is ambitious and stunning. It didn't hold me the whole time, but it brought me back over and over until its finale.

A woman chained to a pentagram. A hooded and cloaked man, the executioner of an inquisition, performs a ritual in which Satan impregnates her with his son.

The other monks catch him and torture him on the rack for making a pact with the devil. He claims Satan is the true power, so a priest axes him in the chest. The man claims that when his axe is retrieved, he will return at full power.

A luxury yacht, on the owner's orders, sails through a channel off the coast of South America. The captain calls the order into question based on advice from Bob, a passenger and big game hunter. They notice the channel lights off the shoreline are not the same.

Regardless, the owner orders the go-ahead. The owner and his chums discuss the morality of hunting with Bob.

<blockquote><i>— I asked you if there'd be as much sport in the game if you were the tiger instead of the hunter.
— Well, that's something I'll never have to decide… This world is divided into two people: the hunter and the hunted. And luckily, I'm the hunter. Nothing could ever change that.</i></blockquote>

At that, the ship runs aground and explodes. Three men make it off the boat, but sharks drag down two of them, leaving only Bob. Bob swims to shore. He stumbles through the jungle until he arrives at a chateau on an opposing shore.

Inside, he meets Count Zaroff and the survivors of a previous shipwreck. Count Zaroff is a fellow game hunter. He laments how the sport bore him.

<blockquote><i>What I needed was not a new weapon, but a new animal… Here on this island, I hunt the most dangerous game.</i></blockquote>

One pulls him aside and tells him there used to be more of them, but they have disappeared.

Where have they gone? And what does the Count keep in his trophy room?

While I assume most people know the answer, I'll refrain from spoiling it, just in case.

This film was shot on the same sets as King Kong (same director too — Ernest B. Schoedsack) and shared some actors. The chateau looks so good!

The effects are killer! They pull some deceptively simple shots while having the confidence not to linger on how sharp the effect is.

A woman surrounded by candles. A vision of a nude woman on a glowing table — Dimitri's face merges with hers. The woman escapes or something.

Satan admonishes Dimitri for letting her escape. Satan gives Dimitri one last chance before he dies to deliver the antichrist into the world. And he will do it through Jessica, his ex.

Jessica tells her husband, Robert, that she is pregnant. He silently questions it but ultimately welcomes the development.

The pregnancy is weird, though. Jessica vomits blood and goes to the doctor. The doctor tells her that the pregnancy is moving at an alarming rate. The baby inside her is already three months along.

<blockquote><i>— No doctor can explain her pregnancy 
</i><i>— What do you mean?
</i><i>— Her pregnancy is unexplainable</i></blockquote>Jessica begins to have violent mood swings. She lashes out, then comes to, unaware of what she did.

In a moment of clarity, she goes in for an abortion. Dimitri speaks through her and declares this baby must be born, no matter what.

If this sounds rad, it kind of is. But between this action is scene after scene of dudes talking about Jessica. So boring!

The movie fumbles along in its <i>Rosemary's Baby</i> plot for an hour before it pivots to its <i>Exorcist</i> plot, which is a little more fun but still way too much talking and not enough pea soup vomiting.

The soundtrack rules — Robert is a record producer and records a song with a band about making a deal with the devil that is a jam. The score is peak Italian horror.

The movie had so much potential! Watch the ""sequels"" — in classic Italian fashion, none of the sequels have anything to do with this. Beyond the Door III is stellar.

An astronaut crew returns to Earth after a mission into deep space. A film studio prepares stock footage in case something goes wrong.

Meanwhile, Thelma Joyce rushes to the studio to do a talk show about caving. She discusses a discovery in a Colorado cave but freezes up. She gets a feeling that something bad is happening.

She reaches out to Peter, who tells her to get over it, saying, “It ain’t real, honey.”

<blockquote><i>— Hey Thelma, how are the stalactites? Still growing?
— Like crazy! In two thousand years, they’ll be a foot higher.</i></blockquote>
A child named Lucy finds a blue pulsating thing on the beach. It approaches. Later, her mother calls for her but cannot find her. She walks behind a dune to see the child sitting next to a blue rock. Her face appears mangled.

Thelma’s caving crew prepares for another trip. On the way, Bert finds a blue stone and gives it to Thelma.

During their exploration, Jill notices that the blue stone in Thelma’s bag is moving. Something erupts from the rock, taking Jill’s face.
<blockquote>
<i>Do you think there are “monsters” inside all of us?</i></blockquote>This movie is an unofficial sequel to the 1979 classic Alien that slipped in just before Alien became a trademarked franchise. It didn’t receive enough distribution to upset many kids expecting a legit Alien sequel.

A strong indicator you’re watching a terrible movie is how much driving footage it includes. A solid sign that you’re watching a bad Italian movie is if the soundtrack is inexplicably great compared to the film itself.

We watch Thelma’s boyfriend drive her around in her Wagoneer a bunch. We also watch her stand on the shore and wait for a rowboat to come in — no matter how many cuts they make, it’s uninteresting footage.

The caving footage is pretty cool, though!

He tells Daisy about a painter who painted for Satan. A painter who lived in the same bell tower that Antonio lives in now.

<blockquote><i>Modern Times</i>. A story of industry, of individual enterprise — humanity crusading in the pursuit of happiness.</blockquote>
Chaplin's riff on <i>À Nous la Liberté</i>, while little more than a remake with Chaplin's Little Tramp inserted, has its own charms and memorable gags. Also, I can appreciate any film with class consciousness at its core being as popular as this movie was and is. 

That said, I doubt Chaplin, being the slick capitalist he was, had any motive beyond capitalizing on a movement. Anytime any social realist issues at the heart of the movie came up, he dismissed them outright, saying he only wanted to satirize industrial life.

The film debuted nearly a decade into talkies, so Chaplin's silent Little Tramp also functions as a man outside of history. Again, this is not out of any intent from Chaplin, as the character had lines until he couldn't make them work. Also, the character sings gibberish — the only time the Little Tramp has a voice in a film.

I appreciate Chaplin's massive influence, but I never get much pleasure from his movies. I think I've tried to watch most of them at least once. This movie will be the first I've finished, and that's because this is hands down the best Chaplin movie.

Aki is a film projectionist who fixates on dead bodies. Everywhere she goes, she sees the spirit of a child.

We see Aki killing a woman, cutting her ovaries out of her body. But Aki doesn't remember it. And she may not be the only one.

The tone of this movie is entirely different than <i>Evil Dead Trap</i>. This movie goes for a surreal, dream logic where everything feels fractured and unreal.

For a good part of the movie, this works well and sets an uncomfortable mood. But when the film hits the third act, the tone inhibits its ability to find a way to an ending. As a result, the last 20-30 minutes are repetitive and exhausting.

Of course, the Black counterman at his favorite diner (Mantan Moreland) laughs at every joke, including Jeff's unapologetically racist ones. And the women at his office tolerate his aggressively misogynistic jokes. What option do they have?

Althea loves watching the race riots on TV, but Jeff can't stand hearing about it. Althea performs a rehearsed spiel about racial inequality in America, but Jeff isn't interested.

As Jeff Gerber awoke one morning from uneasy dreams, he found himself transformed in his mirror into a Black man.

<blockquote><i>A nightmare, or too much sunlamp? Boy, what a great sunlamp.</i></blockquote>

Thank god Melvin Van Peebles came onto this project, or else it would have been another <i>Soul Man</i> or worse. The original goal was to make a movie about a white man's redemption — he becomes Black to learn the error of his ways and then returns to whiteness with an ""enlightened"" perspective. They only hired Van Peebles to generate positive press for hiring a Black director.

Van Peebles tactfully maneuvered within the studio system to make a film that critiques Hollywood and presents revolutionary politics that undercut the studio's aim. He brought Godfrey Cambridge and Mantan Moreland onto the project. He ""forgot"" to film the ending the studio wanted, where it was all a dream.

It is, of course, a fucking shame how relevant this movie still is. Thankfully, it is also still hilarious and uncomfortable.

Phillip Lamont (Richard Burton) prays to Father Lankkester Merrin (Max von Sydow) for aid in exorcizing a woman in a Latin American community. The woman knocks over the candles, setting herself and the building ablaze. The Cardinal asks Lamont to look into Father Merrin's death — the events of <i>The Exorcist</i>. Their goal is to remove Satan from the church by proving his lack of involvement in Merrin's death.

Regan (Linda Blair) leads an average life, dancing in a school show and flirting with a saxophone player. She sees a psychiatrist, Dr. Gene Tuskin (Louise Fletcher). Regan claims not to remember what happened to her, but Dr. Tuskin doesn't believe her.

Lamont comes to see Regan to ask her about her past, but Dr. Tuskin advises against it. The two fight over possession versus mental illness. Dr. Tuskin hooks Regan to a biofeedback machine that synchronizes two people's brainwaves. Dr. Tuskin takes the other end, and Lamont questions Regan. Dr. Tuskin gets lost, so Lamont takes Regan's place to find her.

Lamont sees Regan possessed by Pazuzu, killing Father Merrin.

<blockquote><i>It was horrible. Utterly horrible. And fascinating.</i></blockquote>

Regan draws a picture of Lamont in flames. He understands it as a message that something is on fire. He runs down to the basement and finds a box in flames. For Lamont, it confirms that Regan still contains Pazuzu — locked away, but not for long.

As a horror fan, I've learned to abandon setting expectations around comparisons between sequels and originals. The disappointment hinders any appreciation of the sequel.

The first hypnosis scene in the glass octagon is so bonkers! I've never seen this type of scene played out this way. Everyone's performance is solid, but Richard Burton taps into an authentic shock that elevates the scene.

The scenes in Africa are offensive and reductive. They're also ridiculous and entertaining — flying from the perspective of locust? Hell yeah.

My feelings about the scene with the girl with autism are unclear.

This movie suffers in the same way as <i>Doctor Sleep</i> — when it's in fresh territory, it's at least interesting. But when it has to come back to <i>Exorcist</i> stuff, it gets boring.

Because of the glut of possession movies we've had (and another reboot of <i>The Exorcist</i>), a possession movie like this feels relatively refreshing.

This movie isn't great, but it's far from the ""worst sequel in the history of film."" ","hooptober, hooptober7.0, religious horror, possession",2024-02-12

Stefan Crosscoe (Christopher Lee), standing in front of outer space, reads a screenwriter modification of Revelation 17:2 from somewhere in the middle of the Bible:

<blockquote><i>For it is written: ""The inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with her blood. And I saw her sit upon the hairy beast. And she held forth a golden chalice full of the filthiness of her fornications. And upon her forehead was written: 'Behold! I am the great mother of harlots and all abominations of the earth.'""</i></blockquote>

<i>Los Angeles, California, USA — City of the Angels</i>

Ben attends a funeral for his sister, Karen, our hero from Howling. Outside, Crosscoe tells Ben that Ben's sister is alive. He hands Ben his card with his occupation: an occult investigator. After Ben tells him to fuck off, Karen's colleague Jenny reads the card and chases after Crosscoe. Crosscoe tells Jenny that Karen is a werewolf.

As Crosscoe leaves, Mariana snarls at him. Erle strikes his feet on the ground the way a dog does after taking a shit. That will be his recurring bit.

Ben and Jenny meet with Crosscoe. He shows Ben and Jenny the silver bullets used to kill Karen but were removed during the autopsy, thus leaving her soul in unrest. Crosscoe shows them the VHS tape of Karen turning into a werewolf from the end of Howling. He tells them how Mariana is immune to silver bullets and that only titanium will kill her. He tells them about Stirba, their leader, whose 10,000th birthday will happen on the next full moon, unveiling all werewolves.

To stop it, they must destroy Stirba. To find her, they must go to the dark country — Transylvania.

I wasn't a massive fan of the first Howling, only because it did very little werewolf stuff and a lot of characterization that I didn't care about. This movie ramps up the fun and gives me what I wanted from Howling. It's hokey and outrageous, and I had a blast.

Arthur Jameson pulled some light war crimes during the Vietnam War. He's out to cover his tracks and kill anyone who knows. This includes his partner, China Smith, and Sergent Frank DaVinci, who carried out some assassinations on his behalf.

Frank is getting married to Lupe.

China is running late because his girlfriend, Colette, is masturbating in the bath. They get ready, but China wants to fuck before they go to the wedding. They run to the car, but Colette runs back in. The car explodes, killing China.

As Frank and Lupe leave the service, gunmen shoot Frank and Lupe, as well as several innocent bystanders. Frank survives and goes to Vegas.

Colette takes out some would-be assassins and goes into hiding.

Three months later, Colette finds Frank in Vegas. She reveals she was working with China and that she's a CIA agent. And that Arthur Jameson is her boss.

This movie is a sequel to <i>DaVinci's War</i> — no, I haven't seen it. No, I won't watch it. Joey Travolta, the older brother of John Travolta, wrote, produced, and co-starred in this project with Anna Nicole Smith. 

This movie was Smith's first starring role. She'd do two more movies with PM Entertainment, including the infamous <i>Skyscraper.</i>

I had a tough time following this movie. I paused and rewinded several scenes to catch names.

The movie has some pretty stellar car stunts and explosions. There's an incredible scene where Anna Nicole Smith drives a stolen police car backward, shooting at some dudes, pulls a 180, throws a bomb out the window, and drives through a helicopter, causing it to explode.

Five years after the events of <i>The Slumber Party Massacre</i> (and kinda sort of <i>Sorority House Massacre</i>), five women buy the same sorority house. They stay overnight to meet the movers and begin renovating in the morning. 

Janey waits until they move in to disclose that this is the old Hochstatter place with several gruesome murders. How else could they acquire the place at such a low cost?

Lighting strikes — a storm comes that night, knocking out the power. Their neighbor, Orville Ketchum, comes over and tells them about finding the bodies and Hochstatter's death. He reaches into his pants, appearing ready to reveal his penis, but instead produces a basement key.

They go to the basement like the Scooby Gang, finding Hochstatter's tools and an Ouija board. After multiple shower and clothes-changing scenes, the women gather around the Ouija board in their lingerie. They take shots and try to contact Hochstatter's ghost. The planchette flies off into the fire.

Janey goes downstairs for a shot when a figure in black grabs her. The shadow of a hook descends — a cartoonish volume of blood sprays all over the kitchen walls. Suzanne goes looking for Janey. Her foot gets caught in a bear trap.

Who's doing this? Is it Orville? Hochstatter's ghost? A third thing??

Unlike <i>Sorority House Massacre</i> and <i>The Slumber Party Massacre</i>, women did not write and direct this movie. Directed by Jim Wynorski of <i>Cleavagefield</i>, <i>The Bare Wench Project</i>, and <i>Para-Knockers Activities</i> fame, this movie recycles <i>Slumber Party</i> footage and distorts the space-time continuum. I get it. The giant drill footage is more outrageous than anything in <i>Sorority House</i> or, sadly, this movie. 

It honestly doesn't matter. It's one of the rare cases where not watching any of the prior films will make this easier to understand.

This movie leans hard into parody, making several winking references to slasher tropes.

The movie knows exactly what it is, so it's easy-going and fun. It loses steam once it goes full slasher but doesn't implode.

Four men in masks hold up a vehicle carrying company wages just outside Giboni Pharmaceutical Company. A witness calls the cops. The guard tries to close the gates, but the thieves shoot him. One man stabs one carrier, grabs the bag, and then runs off. A guard's bullet hits their gas tank, causing a leak.

The cops chase the men, but they celebrate the massive haul they took. The car runs out of gas from the leak, so they run on foot into a parking garage. They take a couple of women hostage, holding them at knife and gunpoint. Blade accidentally stabs one woman in the neck. It benefits them, as the police back off while they steal a car. They take the other woman, Maria, with them.

They know the cops see their stolen vehicle, so they take the car of a man, Ricardo, and his sick son, Tino. Tino needs surgery, but the thieves force Ricardo to drive them out of town to their hideout.

The movie follows the tense journey and the perils along the way.

Mario Bava, once given creative control over his movies, had difficulty drawing in audiences and profits. 

Production difficulties plagued this movie as the production company went bankrupt, the crew stopped working, and actors were fired and recast mid-shoot.

This movie sat on the shelf for years until actress Lea Lander, who played Maria, acquired the rights.

Several versions of the movie with edits exist, but the easiest to access is the version Lamberto Bava oversaw, called Kidnapped.

This movie was an attempt to jump on the Poliziotteschi trend. As a result, the film lacks most of Bava's signature visual style, going for a neutral realism instead of a colorful hyperreality.

In addition, the movie lacks Poliziotteschi's nuanced social commentary, landing somewhere around ""men are inherently evil.""

That mentality works in Giallo because we must believe anyone is capable of terrible murders. Here, it keeps the tension going but prevents the audience from connecting to what's happening. It's crucial since we're in a car with these characters throughout the movie.

Still, this is a solid movie if you forget it's a Mario Bava project — the pacing is brisk, and the problems are unrelenting.

This will be a revelation for people who rarely connect to Bava's films. Bava fans might find this sterile and impersonal.

Police stand over a dead woman. A reporter named Jean sneaks on the scene and talks to Inspector Lonzo. Jean recently moved to this neighborhood, and this murder is the third in two weeks. She gets no answers, but the Inspector tells her to leave town.

Cut to a party Jean is throwing. A goth punk band called Disease sings about suicide as a woman dances with a lightsaber or something. A guy carries a boa constrictor around.

Marica and Jean talk about Bryan, Jean's bass player boy toy. Marcia says Jean is brave for venturing out, leaving her husband, David, and whatnot.

Cut to Jean and Bryan, hungover on the couch. They hear a noise in the bathroom. They pull back the shower curtain to find Marcia dead, her eye cut out, her brain missing — the killer's MO.

The inspector suspects Bryan's band, Disease. Jean thinks it's the unhoused man everyone calls Creeper.

Jean goes on a quest to find the killer, interviewing the neighborhood for answers. The thing is, no one's talking.

This movie is one of the best-looking SOV films I've seen. It looks cheap, but the editing and compositions are above average. It doesn't lean into the in-camera camcorder effects that many SOVs use.

The special effects aren't amazing, but they're effective. There's an autopsy scene where they peel a guy's face off and open his skull. Jean has a wacky nightmare sequence with all sorts of indiscernible goopy gore.

Every nude scene is a single tastefully revealed breast.

The soundtrack is peak 1988 — all default keyboard patches. It feels like an R-rated <i>Are You Afraid of the Dark</i>.

The film capitalizes on the Bay Area post-punk scene, recruiting SF goth-punk staples The Nuns to be the band Disease. We also get a brief Anchor beer cameo. If that isn't enough, we have some B-roll of the Golden Gate Bridge.

Thematically, the movie touches on gentrification and how wealthy poseurs suck the life out of neighborhoods, leaving the most disadvantaged on the street.

The movie develops its subplot surrounding Jean's divorce and figuring her life out in her 30s. Kate Alexander's commitment makes it all work.

Taniguchi Tomoo wakes up next to his wife. He has breakfast with her and their son, Minori. Tomoo does not remember his childhood, but he remembers green fields. The steel blue city's endlessly reflective surfaces, ringing phones, and industrial noise are the only life he knows.

His family goes to a mall and encounters two men, members of a cyborg cult. The men follow them through the record shop. They grab Minori and run off.

After a long cat and mouse, the cult members have Minori on the top of Tomoo's apartment. Tomoo stands in front of them. Steam billows from his body as his arms become a cannon. The man holds Minori over his head. Tomoo shoots. When the smoke clears, the man holds Minori's hands over his head, his face covered in viscera.

Tomoo accidentally killed his son.

Metal links surround him, entangle him. Visions flicker like channels changing stations. He remembers.

The movie is not a sequel to <i>Tetsuo The Iron Man</i>, but a high-budget re-pass on the themes. Like the previous film, the story is only a loose thread to depict a man becoming a machine. 

I was worried that, with a higher budget, this would have fewer charms. And while the movie doesn't have the pure chaos of the first one, it has some killer special effects and visuals. We still get some stop-motion transformation scenes that are pretty sick.

This one is less sexual — no pipes sexually inserted in legs or drill penises. It's also more political — to survive in this world, you must become a machine, whether you want to or not.

It is hundreds of years old. It tells the adventures of a young man, held in thrall by the queen of the fairies, who, in the centuries before pantomime, was reckoned a dangerous lady. It is called ""A Ballad of Tam Lin.""</i></blockquote>

A man plays saxophone in the foyer. A glass etched with folktale imagery stands between him and the camera as it pulls up and looks at the images.

Mickey (Ava Gardner) and Tom (Ian McShane) lay in bed. Tom confesses his love to Mickey. Initially, her only reply was to disclose her age. Then she tells him:

<blockquote><i>I shall love you, love you, love you. Love you and leave you for dead.</i></blockquote>

As they leave the bedroom, Mickey finds the saxophone player, unaware of why he is there. Mickey explains the rules of her country estate. He may stay as long as he likes or as long as she can stand him. He joins several other men who play games, drink cocktails, and get one-on-one time à la The Bachelorette.

Janet (Stephanie Beacham) rides up the estate on her bike, a puppy in the front basket. Through confusing interactions, Janet sells the puppy to Mickey against her wishes. When Tom sees Janet, he is smitten and takes her picture.

Tom seeks Janet, leaving Mickey feeling desperate. She pricks Tom's finger and her own, making a blood oath. If Tom continues to see Janet, he may bring them ill omens.

Ava Gardner gets to play sexy in this movie, which feels like an exception to Hollywood's hatred of women over 40.

Ian McShane and Stephanie Beacham are an odd pair. It takes a while for their relationship to gel, but they find an earnest sweetness that I enjoy.

The soundtrack features original music from The Pentangle. They give the movie a folksy base but add a dreamy surrealism to the estate's bubble. The saxophone does a lot of work establishing mood.

The story is meandering, losing itself in beautiful countryside photography — not an inherent flaw, but at 106 minutes, it tests the audience's patience as it waits for the story to happen.

A couple of scenes turn into a series of stills. It feels like they couldn't figure out how to make the dialogue work. The stills they choose are weird and hilarious. One excuse I could think of is referencing the movie's opening etchings, but none of the scenes align with their content or compositions.

This is Roddy McDowall's only movie he directed, and it's understandable why. The movie had limited release, was re-cut a few years later against his wishes, and has lived in relative obscurity since. I only know about it because of <b>The House of Psychotic Women</b>.

The movie explores a little of Christian faith versus Occult traditions. Though Janet is the daughter of a priest, her mother had charms and read tarot. It also reflects on the Free Love '60s and what remains, leaning into the nuclear family as the only true salvation.

Overall, the movie has its charms. It isn't a movie I love, but the right audience might.",house of psychotic women,2024-02-16

It's after midnight. Gaston clocks into work at a factory. When he turns on the light, he sees Hélène (Patricia Owens) at the hydraulic press. Blood seeps from underneath the press. When Hélène sees him, she runs off.

François (Vincent Price) receives a call from Hélène. She confesses to killing André — her husband and François's brother — and asks François to call the police. Later, Gaston calls to tell François that someone is dead — their head under the press.

The police investigate, but Hélène's confession doesn't line up with the facts. Despite that, she refuses to give motive or details. Someone has trashed André's lab, and Hélène seems obsessed with finding a white-headed fly.

François pretends to have caught the white-headed fly, encouraging Hélène to tell the story.

André had developed a matter transporter. It disintegrates at one point and reintegrates at another. He believes it is perfect, but Hélène points out a flaw in the replication. He tries it on the cat, and it never rematerializes.

Still, André carries on until he finally tries it on himself. The results are too horrifying for the family to bear.

The film plays with the concepts of television transmission and applies it to matter. When André asks François to come over and see the invention, François's first guess is that it's a flat-screen television.

This movie captures a contemporary feeling — that technology is progressing faster than we can understand, and morality gets lost in the race. You know, hubris and whatnot.

<blockquote><i>It's not who invents these technologies — it's just the fact that they exist.</i></blockquote>

The movie's greatest asset is its restraint. The lab glows bright blue and emits striking colors. It understands imagination's power, leaving gaps for us to fill in the movie. The reveals, while silly-looking, are also effective.

My only major complaint is the length. The movie meanders before getting to the main story. Some of it works — taking time for characterization makes the disaster more impactful. But other scenes feel aimless or drawn out.

I like to think the movie is François's extended fantasy — this is the scenario he envisions must happen for it to be morally okay to hook up with his brother's wife.

The mortician, Fred, sees her but doesn't intervene.

Later, she throws a big party at her house. She slips upstairs to be alone in her room, but Wade followers her and tries to make a move. When that fails, he SAs her, only stopping when she scratches him. When Wade leaves, Lindsay picks up a stuffed bear, holding it to her as she reminisces about her father.

Lindsay scans the obituaries for someone who died at the right age. She travels to the mortuary and starts the same routine. As she touches the face, the facial reconstruction collapses under hand, so she runs. But before she leaves, she runs into Alex, brother to the deceased, who bears a striking resemblance to her father.

Fred cruises for a boy, Bobby, taking him back to the mortuary where he works under the guise that he's married so they can't go to his place. They strip down and Fred has Bobby lay down on the slab. Fred straps Bobby down against his will and embalms Bobby while he's still alive.

Fred sees Lindsay at another wake and believes he sees a kindred spirit. He approaches her while she goes in to kiss the body. He tells her about a group he is in that participates in group necrophilia.

The movie is a cross between <i>Toys Are Not for Children</i> and <i>Kissed</i>, with some other exploitation influences mixed in. Unlike the two mentioned movies, this film doesn't explore the psychology behind Lindsay's hangups.

But as an exploitive thriller, it has some decently uncomfortable images. The tones between these and the rest of the movie don't gel that well, but it's not too bad.

The movie uses extended montage to get through some of the plot points, further distancing the audience from any emotional connection to the characters. I read that the director did that to hide some poorly-written dialogue.

Still, I appreciated the direction the story took, especially with how it ended. I just wish the journey there was more cohesive.","tubi, house of psychotic women, exploitation",2024-02-17

The concept is four horror shorts directed by women. Horror anthologies are always a mixed bag, and horror shorts are difficult to nail.

I like everyone involved in this, but they've all done better work.

The in-between scenes are creepy stop-motion toys. There isn't a plot, but there is an arc. They're my favorite part of this.


<b>The Box — Jovanka Vuckovic *.5</b>
Natalie (Natalie Brown) and her kids, Danny and Jenny, are on the subway during Christmastime. A man with a red box intrigues Danny. When the man shows Danny, Danny's face falls. When Jenny asks what it is, he says nothing.

Later, Danny isn't interested in eating dinner. The next day, he avoids breakfast, skipped lunch, and doesn't want dinner again. Robert, his father, is worried, but Natalie assumes it's a stunt.

We know it has something to do with what was in the box. And that Danny doesn't care if he dies.

The story feels less like horror and more like House MD. The narration is too much and takes away from the mood.

Jonathan Watton, who plays Robert, tanks his scenes with an aggressively maudlin performance to everyone else's naturalism.


<b>The Birthday Party — Annie Clark *</b>
Mary (Melanie Lynskey) wakes up and anxiously decorates the house for a birthday. The decorations are all in black and white. Carla (Shiela Vand) helps her get things ready.

Mary goes into her husband David's office and finds him dead. She continues without letting Carla or her daughter, Lucy, know.

The story is what would be the motivating backstory in a horror film for why the lead is fucked up.

The music is overbearing and suggests far more tension than what's onscreen.

The color and cinematography feel like a music video, which I guess goes along with the barrage of music. The concept itself feels like what would back a music video — perhaps why it feels vacant without a song to accompany it.

Joe Swanberg makes an uncredited appearance as a birthday panda.

I love several of the folks involved, but I admit I don't get it.


<b>Don't Fall — Roxanne Benjamin **.5</b>
Gretchen (Breeda Wool), her partner, Jess (Angela Trimbur), her brother, Paul (Casey Adams), and their friend, Jay (Morgan Krantz), go hiking up a mountain. They find some old Native American wall paintings.

Everyone fucks with Gretchen — pretending to push her off the mountain or getting hurt.

Gretchen wakes up in a cave with more paintings depicting a monster. 

This short is horror. It's not the most captivating idea, but it's pretty fun.


<b>Her Only Living Son — Karyn Kusama ***.5</b>
Cora wakes up to her panting dog, Kipper. She goes to check on her sleeping son, Andy. They are hiding from Andy's father, a Hollywood actor.

Cora finds a squirrel nailed to a tree — Andy's doing. She attends a conference at Andy's school, where she learns that Andy tore another girl's nails off. But the principal lets him off because the school believes he is a prodigy.

Thank god for some thematic material! The short explores how society protects violent men from consequences, punishing the victims more than the men themselves.

He shows his wife the headline about a man sleeping with his housemaid. She is dismissive of why someone would fall for a maid. He argues that the maid is what holds the house together.

Seon-young Kwak and Kyeung-Hee Cho prepare a letter to give to the piano accompanist, Mr. Kim, of their choir group.  The letter is a confession of love. Miss Cho slips the letter under the keyboard cover.

Mr. Kim offers piano lessons to the group before opening the cover. Upon finding the letter, he turns it in, which inspires Miss Kwak to quit.

Miss Cho sees her off and then goes to Mr. Kim's for piano lessons. He shows her the new house he and his wife are moving into. With that, his overworked and pregnant wife, the house is in disarray. Mr. Kim asks Miss Cho to find a housemaid. She asks Myung-sook, one of her coworkers.

After a family holiday leaves Mr. Kim at home with Myung-soon and Miss Cho, Miss Cho finally confesses that she is the one who loves him, not Miss Kwak.

The cinematography is beautiful. The camera moves elegantly in scenes. It finds little motifs, like hands on the piano.

A man wrote this movie. It's all about women bringing down an ""upstanding"" man for not giving them what they want — basically, a long way around to make him ""innocent.""

The rat is a recurring motif for Kyeung-Hee and Myung-sook. It isn't subtle — Mrs. Kim has a dream where the rats have human faces.

If you don't like melodrama, this movie won't do much for you. But if you can embrace the ridiculousness, it's a wild ride.

This is the prototype for the erotic thriller.

Lemmy rides his motorcycle to Angel's apartment. He needs her help on a song he's writing called ""Van Gogh's Ear."" They perform in a shitty rock band together.

Meanwhile, four men in a car hand a guy in a Santa suit an automatic weapon. The Santa drives his motorcycle by a convenience store, killing Joe Green and his wife and leaving their infant daughter crying. The Santa display behind them collapses, and the sign reads SATAN on the ground.

One of the men in the car, Tanas, finds Lemmy in the dressing room after a show. Lemmy knows Tanas as the guy who managed another band called The Red Dogs. That is until the lead singer and his girlfriend got in a fatal wreck. Tanas offers his money and services to help his bang break out.

Lemmy doesn't consider it until the record company locks them out. He goes to Bar Sinister, Tanas's joint, receiving one final warning from a guy at the bar before going through the door, down into the red halls, until he finds Tanas engaged in a chess game. Tanas shows Lemmy a contract for Lemmy's immortal soul but settles on a handshake.

It's a tale as old as time — a musician trades his soul for musical success. What I like about this rendition is that Satan's gang are all a bunch of morons with automatic weapons.

It's meandering, and the B plot of Sally getting revenge is way more interesting than Lemmy turning into David Byrne. But it has fun moments.

We start in your typical small town, with two giant nuclear reactors in the background. So, like Springfield?

Two kids, Dawn and Brad, play in a kiddy pool. Brad's father, Bill (Lenny Von Dohlen), encourages Brad to play nicely with Dawn. Dawn's mother, Kim (Vivienne Benesch), encourages Bill to go easy on him. So, Brad pulls out his penis and asks to see what Dawn has. Brad yelps in pain and shows his finger — the tip barely hanging on.

Cut to the present day, where Dawn (Jess Weixler) gives a chastity talk to a group of kids. The kids all wear promise rings to keep their virginity until marriage, in which you trade it for a wedding ring.

Brad (John Hensley), meanwhile, is a typical piece-of-shit teenager, listening to death metal, smoking weed, and shooting shit with a pellet gun. He will only have anal sex with his girlfriend, Melanie (Nicole Swahn), despite her encouraging him to try vaginal intercourse. He doesn't remember what happened to his finger, but he believes Dawn did it.

In a sex education class, the teacher can't bring himself to say, ""vagina,"" and the school has covered the anatomy diagram of the vagina in their books with a sticker. Dawn tries to explain the vagina's ""natural modesty,"" but the kids will not let her finish her thought.

Dawn meets Toby (Hale Appleman of The Magicians fame), who just moved to town. She sees his promise ring (and cute face) and falls for him. They and their friends, Gwen and Phil, hang out regularly, but Dawn feels temptation creep in. At night, she fantasizes about marrying Toby, then guilts herself when she gets too close to touching her ""natural modesty.""

One day, they decide to go swimming together at the swimming hole. Dawn tries to maintain a boundary, but Toby pushes. He SAs her, and her ""natural modesty"" kicks in, biting off his penis.

Thus begins Dawn's traumatic journey to understanding her body.

<blockquote><i>It's true!! Vagina dentata! Vagina dentata!</i></blockquote>

The first thirty minutes hit close to home for me, having grown up a devout conservative Christian. I had a promise ring for most of high school but lost it on a youth group beach trip. We had abstinence-only sex education, and I prided myself on speaking up about how unreliable condoms are and whatever other nonsense they told us.

Also, I'm happy to see the family watching The Black Scorpion and The Gorgon.

I'm not shocked that folks treat this as a feminist film — critics and audiences alike have thrown ""feminism"" at nearly every rape revenge movie.

It becomes problematic when Ryan's first rape of Dawn gets reinforced as being the actions of a ""sexually attentive partner,"" thus making the message, ""so long as you give her pills and finger her first, she'll like it when you rape her.""

Also, her comfort with castrating men after two times removes the ""self-defense"" angle, and Dawn merely becomes the misogynist trope of the castrating woman made literal.

I don't mean to diminish anyone's satisfaction from seeing shitty dudes get their dicks torn off. But we live in a post-Lorena Bobbitt world, where John Bobbitt received the full attention of the police to find and surgically reattach his now-functioning penis. The penis claims the headlines, not the rape and abuse Lorena endured that motivated it.

<blockquote><i>Greece, in the year 490 BC, was a land divided — Athens against Sparta — while Athens itself was torn by internal conflict and treachery. Enemy of all Greece and poised for conquest was the great Darius, king of the Persians. In that fateful moment, the Greeks found a hero to unite them — Philippides, the greatest athlete of his time, winner of the Olympic Games, whose race from Marathon to Athens not only saved them from destruction but set the great marathon race which has crowned the Olympics ever since.</i></blockquote>

Philippides becomes commander of the Sacred Guard. Supporters of the ousted tyrant, Hippias, try to get him to fall in love with Charis, occupying his time and neutralizing him. But Philippides loves Andromeda. BUT Theocrites convinces Philippides that Andromeda is with him, so Philippides pursues Charis.

But that stops mattering when Darius plans to attack Greece.

""Sword and Sandal"" is a genre I have a hard time getting into. This one has some greasy boys with big muscles and the peplum staple, Steve Reeves, but it's not enough for me.

It's also hard to understand Theocrites' standpoint. Darius wants them divided and will conquer them, and Theocrites can't wait, like, a week to kill their best hope.

The smaller fight choreography is solid. The war choreo, not so much — mostly boys repeatedly tapping shields.

The underwater stuff is pretty good, especially when dudes are taking arrows to the chiseled torso.

Claude Pinoche grew up in a Parisian orphanage in the 18th century. At twenty, he became a royalist soldier for Louie XVI. While drunk, he bit a sex worker on the neck. They tried to kill him as a vampire, but he murdered them and escaped.

Pinoche deserted the nobility, pretending to be a peasant. Witnessing the French Revolution, he resolved to use his power to suppress revolutions.

In 1935, he moved to Chile and joined the Chilean Army as Augusto Pinochet. He desired to be a king but settled on becoming a general. He used his power to overthrow the socialist government in 1973, becoming Chile's dictator and taking the title ""Count.""

Decades later, he faked his death after authorities investigated his human rights violations.

After 250 years, Augusto no longer wants to live. However, a family dynasty does not go quietly.

The film metaphorically links vampirism to far-right movements throughout history. While not a brilliant metaphor, it is satisfying.

There's a more nuanced version of this movie that trusts its audience to know the history that the narration recapitulates. But this is a Netflix movie.

Despite this, the narrator's subjectivity adds depth to the story, so it's not superfluous.

The gore is disturbing and graphic, and understandably so. If vampirism is the state, then the state's violence cannot be under-emphasized.

The black-and-white enhances and abstracts the gore, making it more stomachable. The grading is beautiful, but beyond aping <i>A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night</i>'s style, it feels unmotivated.

 Pablo Larraín's biggest mistake was, after making a couple of successful movies about political figures — <i>Jackie</i> and <i>Spencer</i> — believing he had a sufficient understanding of Chilean and world history to write this movie. 

But, like several critiques of class and wealth released recently, it rings hollow because the writer was born into wealth.

Sabina Spielrein (Keira Knightley) suffers a mental breakdown following the death of her only sister, Emilia. After one unsuccessful stay at a Swiss sanatorium, her family admits Sabina to Burghölzli.

Eugen Bleuler (André Hennicke) serves as director of Burghölzli, with Carl Jung (Michael Fassbender) operating as an assistant to Bleuler. Jung starts talk therapy with Spielrein, using word association and dream interpretation.

Jung freely discusses his cases with his wife, Emma (Sarah Gadon). She determines Spielrein is the perfect guinea pig for Sigmund Freud's (Viggo Mortensen) talk therapy that Jung intended to work out, despite Freud having no formal method written out.

Jung asks the troubled and suffering Spielrein to serve as his ""assistant."" Spielrein has a preternatural gift for therapy, and Spielrein sees her as a kindred spirit.

Jung meets Freud to present his observations so each may debate their established philosophies like a 101 textbook. Jung tries to get Freud to renounce the notion that all neurosis originates in adolescent sexual experiences. It is ironic since he decides that everything Spielrein suffers from stems from her father beating her, turning her on as a child.

Otto Gross (Vincent Cassel) also shows up because Jung needs an exterior motivator to have sex with Spielrein.

Keira Knightley makes some incomprehensible acting choices — not bad, just bizarre. Everyone else plays perfectly flat affects with regionally appropriate accents.

David Cronenberg has been vocally anti-therapy for most of his career, considering himself above the need for it. I love some of Cronenberg's movies, but when he moves too far from his delusional world, Cronenberg fumbles more than succeeds.

Maurice Hall (James Wilby) meets Clive Durham (Hugh Grant) while attending the University of Cambridge. One night, Clive confesses his love for Maurice — not a brotherly love, but something romantic. Though initially horrified, Maurice reciprocates, and the two start an affair. While Clive is risk-averse, having a social position to consider, Maurice follows his heart, even letting the secret of the relationship get him expelled.

Their relationship worries Clive when the police arrest a mutual friend, Lord Risley (Mark Tandy), for soliciting sex from a soldier. So, Clive breaks things off with Maurice and marries a wealthy woman named Anne.

The film follows the trials of their friendship, as well as Maurice's inner conflict with his sexual identity.

Since the film is a Merchant Ivory production, the sets, costumes, and locations are all meticulous and gorgeous.

The adapted script is brilliant, taking the insular novel by E.M. Forster and turning it into an outward expression of the complex dynamic between Maurice and the world.

Wilby and Grant have tremendous chemistry — their scenes feel passionate and authentic. Wilby also has scenes with Rupert Graves that unveil the truth — they are two straight guys trying to pretend to like what they're doing.

The movie's duration, at 2.5 hours, is somehow insufficient and excessive. Following Maurice's transition into a new chapter, the film abruptly ends, leaving me stunned.

The movie's first half is genuinely perfect — every aspect of the filmmaking felt in harmony, and I believed I was witnessing this story unfold. Again, once Rupert Graves comes around, the illusion breaks.

That such an outspokenly gay movie coming out during the AIDS crisis is so inspiring.

I love so much of this movie, and I'm gutted that it doesn't sustain what it builds. Still, this film is a beautiful achievement that deserves more attention.","criterion channel, edited by women, queer",2024-02-20

Louise (Carrie Snodgress) is a head librarian in Wichita, Kansas. When not at work, Louise cares for her ailing father, Wendell (Ray Milland), who has limited mobility. Her father is constantly verbally abusive and condescending to Louise. Louise fantasizes about taking revenge on or killing her father.

<blockquote><i>Women. They're all the same: weak, manipulating, vindictive. The only good woman I knew was your poor, dead mother. I'm waiting for some of her to rub off on you.</i></blockquote>

One evening, she has a nervous breakdown at work and makes a fire from some books. Back home, she puts on Super 8 home movies of her and her fiancé, Robert, who left her at the altar nineteen years ago. She cuts her wrists and clings to one of her several stuffed monkey dolls.

After surviving the incident, she resigns from her library job and comes to work to train her new replacement, Emily. Emily is kind to Louise, and the two become friends. Louise confides her fears in Emily, who is curious and compassionate. She tells Emily how she regrets not taking more chances in her life.

One day, Louise and Emily go shopping and see a pet store with a chimp for sale.

<blockquote><i>— I'm not crazy about them myself. Why do you like them?
— Because they'll never betray you like humans do.</i></blockquote>

After Louise and Emily part ways, Emily buys the chimp for Louise, sparking a journey that finally brings the truth to light.

The movie explores parental abuse and possessiveness and how it carries into adulthood. While not subtle, the explored themes are less exploitative as similar genre movies.

Carrie Snodgress gives an empathetic performance as the deeply wounded Louise, elevating the schlocky material beyond mere mockery.

The addition of Emily also gives relief to Louise's otherwise tormented existence. And that Louise can return that support adds such warmth. I nearly cried at Louise's going-away party — it was delightful.

The tone has comedic turns, especially once the chimp comes along. It feels a little like <i>Twin Peaks</i> in how it folds in. However, that may be because Frances Bay makes an appearance.

Even in psychological dramas, protagonists can endure hardship and still find moments of hope and kindness. This isn't a great movie, but it is singular in its approach to genre.",house of psychotic women,2024-02-21

Sarah (Carmen Ejogo) sits with her father, Bud (David Pendleton). She wears a gas mask and gloves. She hugs her husband, Paul (Joel Edgerton). Their seventeen-year-old son, Travis (Kelvin Harrison Jr.), helps move the father to a wheelbarrow. Paul and Travis wear masks and gloves as well. Outside, Travis apologizes before covering Bud's face with a pillow and shooting him. They wrap up the body, put him in a hole, and set him on fire.

The family eats dinner in silence by the light of a lantern. Later, Travis goes off independently through the house while his parents argue. He enters his room, which has a print of Pieter Bruegel the Elder's The Triumph of Death, which depicts a skeleton army killing en masse.

The camera abandons Travis and walks through the house, arriving at a red door locked inside. Unmasked, Travis walks into a room and sees a sweating man hunched over. It's Bud. He rises and pukes blood.

Sarah wakes Travis up from his nightmare. There's an intruder in the house (Christopher Abbott). What happens next will change everything for them.

By this point, the movie has made its entire plot clear.

Predictability isn't an inherent flaw. Watching how it plays out is dull, but the ending is tense and gave me the ickies (compliment).

This would be a solid film to base conversations around media literacy.

I don't love it, but it contains all the required beats for its story.


<b>*** SPOILER TALK***</b>
So, it's pretty clear Travis is already sick before Will arrives. The dream recalls his exposure to Bud's disease. So, from 15 minutes in until the climax, it's a red herring game where they worry if Abbott's character, Will, will be their downfall.

Travis' surreal exploration of the house and sleep delulus is our second signifier that he is losing it. It is our way into the subjective experience of the illness.

Francine (Sandra Dee) is on summer break. Pattie and B.L. want to go on a manhunt, but Francine wants to hang out with her friends. She reluctantly follows her friends to the beach, where they instantly spot a group of boys to make a move on.

The score gives a ""whomp whomp"" as Francine undresses to her bathing suit and reveals that she has small breasts. They toss a ball around to draw the boys's attention. The ball rolls to Moondoggie (James Darren), who considers approaching. His friends warn him against chasing ""jailbait.""

The boys are surfers who are looking for some bitchin' waves, bro. The girls abandon Francine, so she puts on her snorkeling gear and goes swimming. She gets caught in sea kelp, so Moondoggie paddles over to help her.

<blockquote><i>Hold on for your life, we're gonna shoot the curl</i></blockquote>

With Francine on the board, Moondoggie catches a wave to bring them inland. The big kick hits Francine, and she wants to take up surfing. She gets the money from her parents for a cheap board and meets up with the boys. Though the beach bums are unsure, they welcome her in, giving her the nickname ""Gidget,"" meaning ""girl midget.""

This movie was Sandra Dee's breakthrough. It's also the movie that helped kick off the beach party movie trend and helped mainstream surfing in the USA. By extension, this is one of the first teen comedies.

The film is breezy and fun. It touches lightly on adolescent perspectives of the world, avoiding the typical condescension of 1950s filmmakers. That sincerity and respect led to the film's success and what so many beach party clones missed.

The movie has jokes, too! Francine is smart and bookish, so she gets some funny quips throughout.

<blockquote><i>Gee, this is a real den of iniquity, ain’t it?</i></blockquote>

The ColumbiaColor is rich and attractive, giving the whole movie a pleasant warmth.

Sandra Dee is perfect as the teenage tomboy. It probably helps that the actress was her character's age.

Thank god Elvis was in the Army when this came out — James Darren has the handsome charm to pull off Moondoggie's attitude.

Darren's character is supposed to be younger than the actor, but watching a 16- and 23-year-old flirt feels weird. Different times and whatnot, but still. She also kisses a dude in his 30s.

<blockquote><i>The single biggest threat to man's continued dominance on the planet is the virus.</i> — Joshua Lederberg, Ph. D</blockquote>

<b>July 1967, Motaba River Valley, Zaire — Mercenary Camp</b>
The film imagines a deadly disease named after the Motaba River taking over a military encampment. They call in the USA for support. The US Army sends Donald McClintock (Donald Sutherland) and William Ford (Morgan Freeman) to investigate. They call for an airdrop. By airdrop, they mean bomb the place to hell and hopefully eradicate the disease.

<b>1995, United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, Ft. Detrick, Maryland</b>
Colonel Sam Daniels (Dustin Hoffman) works at Biosafety Level 4, where they study deadly diseases with no known cure. After a disease outbreak in Zaire, William Ford, now Brigadier General, orders Sam to investigate the hot zone before the World Health Organization gets involved.

Sam assembles his team — Lieutenant Colonel Casey Schuler (Kevin Spacey) and Major Salt (Cuba Gooding Jr.), who is new to the division. They arrive at an infected village where everyone has died. The locals believe that the disease is a punishment for the mass deforestation in their region.

Sam reports his concerns to Ford, who dismisses them on the notion that they have contained the disease. Regardless, the team takes samples and studies them. But Ford and McClintock have their own agenda.

Meanwhile, smugglers capture a white-faced capuchin and put it on a plane to the USA. Would it surprise you to know that the capuchin has the deadly disease?

The movie's first act is gripping. It's Hollywood bullshit, especially the bunk science, but it's intriguing bullshit.

The movie has a weird divorce subplot. I know why movies have divorce subplots — it's cheap character development. Throw in some dogs during the divorce, and you get some humanizing. It just isn't necessary.

Patrick Dempsey shows up with long hair and a single cross earring if you're into that sort of thing.

The movie's sense of humor falls flat for me, but it's that Marvel movie humor.

The disease spreading is funny at first. But the movie gets schmaltzier and more jingoistic by the minute, with heartwarming music as the military enforces a curfew and quarantine. Political grandstanding as higher-ups prove to their team (and the audience) that America cares about its citizens.

The real enemy is the friends we made along the way.


<b>*** SPOILER TALK ***</b>
Ford and McClintock trying to keep the disease under wraps is fine. But if you send in an expert who tries to HELP you keep it under wraps, wouldn't you listen to him? It is asinine drama for the sake of a villain.

Of course, it's McClintock who JUST HAS to bomb somebody and will stop any progress that prevents him from bombing. Again, it makes no sense.

The rednecks shooting at the military are hilarious.

Donald Sutherland argues why we can drop bombs on the Japanese or Vietnam but not on US citizens who pose a global danger. By US Army standards, he's not wrong.","hooptober, hooptober7.0, edited by women, nature attacks, disease horror",2024-02-22

<blockquote><i>When the war ended, Tokyo became a city of savages. It was kill or be killed in the battle for survival, and the weak lost out.</i></blockquote>

Komasa Sen is a sex worker. She leads a band of fellow sex workers — Roku, Mino, Ofuku, and Machiko — who stick together and protect one another from the American GIs and the Yakuza. They are squatters in a bombed-out building that secures them from the outside world.

Maya walks the streets, shell-shocked and desperate. She begs Sen, who offers Maya a job. Sen gives Maya the rundown on sex work and lays out the one cardinal rule: never give it to a guy for free.

Ofuku breaks the rule. The women strip her, tie her up, flog her, and leave her bound to a boat in the barge. If she lives, she can't come back to them.

Ibuki is a former soldier wounded in a fight with an American GI. He knifed the GI, sending the military police after him. On the run, he finds refuge in the women's den. They reluctantly let him stay until he heals up.

Ibuki charms the women, but Maya sees more than a sexual partner. She sees a way out.

<blockquote><i>Hit bottom, suffer the hard times, and rebuild from scratch. That's the only route to a new life.</i></blockquote>

The backstreets in this movie are sometimes convincing. Other times, the world is just a stage play. Flat buildings cut into three walls, with the fourth wall open to the camera. Painted skies and studio lighting pull you out of the desolation and into the subjective.

In one scene, a spotlight shines on Sen as she entertains a john.

Each woman wears a color — Sen in red, Roku in yellow, Mino in purple, and Maya in green. Machiko wears a black traditional kimono — a symbol of the lost geisha culture.

In scenes that enter the women's internal dialogue, the world will glow their respective colors, further highlighting the subjectivity of the moment.

Precise lighting keeps the movie from being more exploitative than it is. And it is exploitative. Everyone shows some amount of skin throughout the film, including the fit Ibuki, who gets a shower butt scene.

The movie has an almost humorous tone. It's never laugh-out-loud funny, but the peculiarities and character behaviors stand out against the bleak world they inhabit.

Elegantly blocked and composed, this movie is a visually striking potboiler with more on its mind than titillation.","criterion channel, criterion, cmc, cmc2016, solidarity, sexploitation, pinku, claire denis req",2024-02-22

<blockquote><i>The fumes of the dead hung in the air like poison. A plague more cruel and more pitiless than war had descended upon us. A pestilence that would leave half our kingdom dead. Where did it come from? What carried its germ? The priests told us it was God's punishment. For what sin, what commandment must we break that would earn this? No, we knew the truth. This was not God's work, but devilry or witchcraft, and our task, to hunt down a demon as God's cure.</i></blockquote>

Osmund (Eddie Redmayne) is a novice monk at a monastery. Though he worries about following God, he has already disobeyed by hiding a woman named Averill (Kimberley Nixon) in the monastery. But after Brother Ignatius dies of the plague, the monastery no longer feels safe. Osmund sends Averill to Dentwich Forest to hide until the plague passes. Averill urges him to come with her, but he feels torn in deciphering God's will.

Ulric (Sean Bean) arrives at the monastery to find a guide through Dentwich Forest. Word is that a village in the marshland has somehow avoided the plague. Ulric intends to locate it. Taking it as a sign, Osmund volunteers as a guide. The Abbot warns Osmund about Ulrich and what is out there. But Osmund has prayed. And God has answered.

When Osmund meets the other men in Ulric's team, they give him the complete story of the village — that it follows a demon who takes human sacrifice and raises people from the dead. The bishop wishes to bring the necromancer to execution.

The movie follows the men on their journey and the trials they face. Their mission shows them the world of superstition that cannot understand the meaning of a plague. 

The movie is a little dull until they arrive at the village. Then it turns into a medieval Wicker Man, at least for a bit.

<blockquote><i>— Word of the pestilence has not reached you?
— Word is all that has reached us.</i></blockquote>

Unfortunately, the movie abandons any ambiguity by the end, complete with several monologues and voiceovers.

The movie is not very gory. It's more squelching sounds than anything (an exception in the spoiler zone).

I liked aspects of the score. It wasn't anything innovative, but it had some motifs and textures that hit the pleasure center.

Overall, the movie is uneven and a bit of a drag. You might enjoy the story better than me.

People in masks hump things and other shenanigans. 

The film was shot on video to recreate a found footage aesthetic, complete with scan lines, auto tracking, and in-camera titles.

Initially, I found myself laughing without having an obvious reason. It isn't quite a discomfort — maybe I enjoy uncanny absurdity.

But when it tries to descend into something darker, it betrays its intentions. Harmony Korine didn't have confidence in his idea, so he added murder, which is far less disturbing than the scene where they tell a child how to hide a razor blade in an apple.

Similarly, he originally wanted to leave VHS tapes around so that they became authentic found footage. But he abandoned that and went for traditional distribution.

Korine wanted something that felt like a bit of magic in ordinary life, but its artifice was too prevalent. This isn't Diane Arbus — this is pretending.

That doesn't mean the film is an outright failure — I appreciate some of the weirdness on display and the degraded Americana. But its insistence that it is being transgressive doesn't land, especially now 15 years after its release.","criterion channel, found footage, cmc, cmc2016",2024-02-23

We open at Stonehenge:

<blockquote><i>It has been written since the beginning of time, even onto these ancient stones, that evil, supernatural creatures exist in a world of darkness. And it is also said man, using the power of the ancient runic symbols, can call forth these powers of darkness — the demons of hell.</i></blockquote>Professor Harrington drives through the woods at night, speeding to the gates of Lufford Hall, the home of Dr. Julian Karswell. Harrington demands to see Karswell, to beg him to undo what he did. He promises Karswell to call off the press and the investigation to grant privacy to Karswell and his followers.

The clock strikes 9 PM. Karswell's face sinks, insisting he will do what he can but that Harrington should go home. Harrington, relieved, returns home. But before he enters his house, a billowing cloud of smoke hurdles towards him. The smoke coalesces and manifests as a demon. Harrington tries to drive away, but it is too late — the demon parts its mouth, unveiling its fangs.

Back at Lufford Hall, Karswell burns a newspaper, whose headline promises an exposé on Karswell's satanic cult at an international convention on paranormal psychology.

Dr. John Holden, a prominent psychologist, flies into London to attend the convention. Lloyd Williamson, personal aide to Professor Harrington, meets Holden at the gate. Williamson explains Harrington's bizarre death.

Holden joins Williamson and Professor O'Brien to pick up where Harrington left off on Karswell's cult. Holden does not believe in demons, but he may be the only one.

The movie explores the line between the scientific and the pseudoscientific.

The soundtrack gives me goosebumps — more still when it cuts out the soundtrack and lets the silence accumulate 

The cinematography is sharp and builds tension. It creates a sense of isolation at times and the feeling of an unknowable presence at others.

The film commits to a dramatic irony where we know that demons are real (or are they???). So, we watch Holden's rational superstition to see what would change his mind. Meanwhile, we share experiences of spiritualism and other similar beliefs, and the movie is more ambiguous about their truth.

Niall MacGinnis has such an unusual energy — he has the perfect demeanor of a villain who always has the upper hand.

The demon manifesting special effects are incredible — billowing smoke adds an unknowability to its pattern, adding suspense to if and when it shows up.

Joan Mitchell walks a trail through the woods and through a graveyard. Her husband, Jack, walks ahead of her, reading his newspaper. Suddenly, she's a dog on a leash. Jack bats her with a newspaper and puts her in a kennel.

Joan wakes up to Jack preparing to leave for work.

She talks about her dreams to her psychotherapist. He mansplains her dreams, telling her that her husband does not trap her — her choices do.

Shirley tells Joan and Sylvia about their new neighbor, Marion Hamilton, at a social gathering. Shirley accuses Marion of being a witch. Joan and Shirley see Marion, who gives Shirley a tarot reading. Marion sees Joan's fear and encourages it — that fear means she understands it better than most.

After a miserable experience with her daughter's fling, Greg, Joan looks into witchcraft to access the power she otherwise doesn't have.

This film is another case of a doomed production for George Romero. The producers wanted horror or softcore, and he gave them neither. Like <i>Martin</i>, the film follows someone who feels powerless and seeks some way to access power. In feeling enslaved to one mode of being, they bound themselves to another. The film doesn't call into question the power itself, but the role it plays in the individual's life.

Throughout the movie, Joan feels trapped by the men in her life — her husband dismisses her and doesn't realize it; Greg assaults and manipulates Shirley, and Joan cannot stop him. She believes that by taking up witchcraft, she can control Greg and her life.

While you could read that the witchcraft makes her feel better, the film argues that it is another mode of powerlessness. Though she makes an incantation to summon Greg, she also drinks half a bottle of Jack Daniels and calls him. When he comes, she believes the incantation did it, not her.

The feminist message that Romero intended is that women have access to more power than they realize, which is nice in theory. But Joan's desires had social and psychological consequences. Still, as a work written during the Second Wave, the movie captures the spirit of self-empowerment and anti-establishment views.

Ultimately, the biggest issue with the movie is the pacing and performances. Jan White does a tremendous job in the lead role, but some actors around her drag scenes into stilted or campy territory.

Regardless, the film is thoughtful and an essential watch for any Romero fans.

When she finds it, however, her bodyguard, Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim), shoots her and steals the spider for his nefarious purposes. Las Arañas, a tribe of people with spider-like powers, tries to save Constance by letting the fancy spider bite her. Though they do not save her, they rescue the baby.

<b>New York, 2003</b>
Cassie Webb (Dakota Johnson) is a paramedic. Her co-worker and closest friend is Ben Parker (Adam Scott). After a dangerous rescue, a car traps Cassie and drags her into the water. There, she sees unfamiliar images, all bound by an invisible web.

Ben saves her, but Cassie experiences déjà vu. After a trillion hours, she connects the dots and realizes her power to predict the future. While trying to understand what is happening to her, she sees a man trying to kill three women — Julia (Sydney Sweeney), Anya (Isabela Merced), and Mattie (Celeste O'Connor). That man is Ezekiel Sims.

Every night, Ezekiel has the same nightmare of the women killing him. With the powers granted to him by the spider he stole and the aid of hacker Amaria (Zosia Mamet), Ezekiel intends to find those women and kill them before they kill him. What he didn't expect, however, was that Cassie would see his plan and thwart it. 

Cassie tries to protect Julia, Anya, and Mattie while learning about her powers and their origin. The truth will grant her access to <b>LIMITLESS POWER</b>.

Let's get this out of the way. This isn't a great movie. The pacing is unbearable, the dialogue is every cliche you can think of, and Tahar Rahim may be the worst actor I've seen in a movie with this big a budget.

That said, this isn't the dumpster fire everyone is saying it is. Cassie Webb is a breath of fresh air in these Marvel movies. She leans close to Jessica Jones-esque sarcasm and groundedness, never turning into the typical dead-eyed superhero. This humanity defines the Spider-Man universe and explains Peter Parker's enduring popularity in comics.

The first act, while silly, is engaging. I was tentatively on board and ready to see where the movie took me. The second act was a fucking slog, with several prolonged seconds of watching someone decide to do something. But there is a moment in the third act that I won't spoil. When it happened, I leaned forward and said, ""I'm in.""

Ezekiel makes the dumbest choices possible to avoid succeeding at his goal. Repeatedly, he could have killed the three women but does something inexplicable instead. Also, whoever dubbed Tahar Rahim's lines made him sound like a cheap Giallo character. I don't think you see his mouth move once in sync with his lines.

The product placement in the movie is hilarious — most notable to me were the Pepsi products. The labels always faced the camera, and characters held drinks in bizarre ways to ensure they never obscured the label. Also, the Pepsi-Cola plant in Long Island City plays a prominent role in the movie.

The 2003 fashion and music are delightful. If you are my age, you may feel they didn't do much to establish 2003. But I think, like most people, we get blinded to just how different contemporary culture is from our youth.

I'll be honest — I want to see the sequel. I think it will be worse than this, and I will regret seeing it.

While I didn't see <i>Morbius</i>, folks I saw this movie with confirmed that this is better than it.

Overall, I liked this movie more than most Marvel things I've seen outside of Spider-verse.","amc southpoint, adam, jim, patricia, directed by women, written by women, edited by women, good for her",2024-02-24

A family reverently trails behind a shambling war veteran. Through bleary eyes, he glazes at the waving American flag. He hikes up the grassy knoll through the ocean of identical crosses — memorials to those lost in World War II. He collapses in front of one cross in particular. The family puts their hands on his back and imagines a bunch of shit that didn't happen to him.

After the brutal Normandy invasion, we watch the brilliant and resourceful John Miller (Tom Hanks) lead a troop of survivors. General George Marshall gives them their orders — they must save Private Ryan so that at least one mother has a son who comes home.

This movie is not anti-war but built to worship the Greatest Generation. The gore and viscera, perhaps designed to inspire disgust, instead satisfy a blood lust demanded of war movies. The stirring patriotic score scans over the sea of bodies. Here, the price of victory is high but necessary.

This film, when contrasted with those depicting the Vietnam War, further reinforces the cultural stereotype that Vietnam veterans are cowards who lost us the war, and they could learn a thing or two from WWII veterans.

This movie led to the development of the Medal of Honor games, which led to the Call of Duty games, one of the most potent recruitment tools in history.

The film is self-aware — Spielberg knew that a mission of 8 men to save 1 is reckless sentimentality on behalf of the higher-ups. But if you want to have a nuanced argument with your audience, you don't make Tom Hanks your misguided hero.

The Matt Damon Aging meme ruined the final reveal for folks like me who hadn't seen it — that the veteran at the beginning is not John Miller, but the titular Private Ryan. His visit to the grave is a reverent outpouring for the sacrifice that led to his survival. 

This movie is a highly influential technical marvel, and I don't feel great about that.","paramount+, anti-criterion challenge 2024, 1001 movies, acc2024",2024-02-25

Coy Buckman, AKA Cannonball, is a racing driver whose life fell apart when he killed a woman by drunk driving. To get his career back on track, he decides to race in the yearly illegal car race, The Trans-America Grand Prix. The race goes from Santa Monica Pier to New York City. 

In addition to the 100K, Modern Motors offers a racing contract to either Buckman or his rival, Cade Redman — whichever one wins gets the contract.

The problem is that Buckman is on parole. And he's fucking his parole officer, Linda. So, when she tries to stop him from racing, Linda accompanies him. Also, the district attorney is aware of the race and puts one of his own in it to take cars down.

A documentary team will be following along to capture all the hijinks.

Inspired by the Cannonball Baker Sea-to-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash and, I guess, <i>Wacky Racers</i>, this movie has an oddball cast of Roger Corman regulars, as well as cast members from Bartel's previous movie <i>Death Race 2000</i>.

To name a few:
* Robert Carradine (aka Lizzy McGuire's dad)
* Dick Miller (who plays Bennie!!)
* Mary Woronov (if she isn't in a Bartel movie, I'd be worried)
* Joe Dante
* Martin Scorsese and Sylvester Stallone as mafiosos

The script is full of one-liners, such as, ""That guy's so mean, I bet he has to jack off in the morning to get his heart started"" or describing beer as, ""best damn vitamins there is — better than spinach, better than fur burgers, better than pasta."" You know, comedy!

The movie has a pile of producers, including The Shaw Brothers, better known for their martial arts productions. David Carradine pulls out a couple of moves from <i>Kung Fu</i>, but that's the extent of martial arts in the movie.

David Carradine gives his standard ""constipated and possibly senile"" performance. 

The movie has almost no internal consistency, especially where drivers are in the race, so it's hard to be too invested beyond whatever interaction happens in each scene. Cannonball stops and wrecks more often than anyone on screen, so his winning is absurd.

This movie kind of sucks, but it has some solid car stunts and explosions, so I can't hate it.","tubi, cmc, cmc2024, carsploitation",2024-02-25

Alderson's eyes flutter open. He finds himself in a cube-shaped room. He is wearing a jumpsuit with his name printed on it. Each of the six surfaces has eight panels with intricate designs resembling maps or circuits, all glowing white. The ninth panel in the center of each surface has a hatch. Each panel interconnects with bars that allow him to climb up the walls.

Alderson pulls open one hatch. He looks inside and sees a room nearly identical to the one he is in, but it glows blue. When he steps away, the hatch automatically closes. He opens one on the floor. This room, also identical, glows red. The third room glows brown.

Alderson enters the brown room. He moves towards another hatch. A swoosh, and he freezes. Razor wires cut through his body. His body collapses into a bloody pile of cubed meat. The bloodied trap folds up and returns to its hidden panel.

Quentin climbs through the red room into the white, where Worth slowly awakens. Another panel opens. Ready for a trap, Quentin pulls the person out and pounces on them. But it is Holloway, another prisoner. A distress call from the brown room. Quentin opens it to see Leaven standing there. He tells her to stop — he knows there's a trap. He jumps in and aids her through it. Finally, Rennes emerges from the blue room.

— Holy cats! Holy, holy cats!

The five prisoners combine their collected knowledge to navigate and hopefully escape their bizarre prison. But human qualities, like trust and socializing, might be a more pressing problem than the prison itself.

The extreme close-ups remind me of Terry Gilliam. It also feels a little like <i>Primer</i> in how they base the prison's design on mathematics despite its physical impossibility. The ""people in a booby-trapped prison"" concept has big <i>Saw vibes. And, of course, the design is very similar to Borges ""Library of Babel.:

That said, this movie is more surreal horror than sci-fi, so looking for a deeper meaning or all-encompassing solution may leave you disappointed. The movie's original concept included surreal aspects, but the budget limited it.

The gore is pretty brutal and good enough for the creative kills.

The sound design is effective in sustaining the horror atmosphere.

The dialogue is the weak link in the movie. The idea drives much of the film, but human relationships are crucial to the conflict.

Also, they have an ""autism is a superpower"" plot point that is… unfortunate.

</i><i>It only exists once, at that moment.</i></blockquote>

Hirayama lives alone with his plants in Tokyo. Every morning, he has a routine before starting his job as a public toilet cleaner. He listens to classic rock tapes in the car and reads whatever $1 paperback he's picked up that week at night. He carries an Olympus point-and-shoot film camera he fills weekly with Holga 400 ISO black-and-white film.

The film depicts Hirayama's routine and some atypical days. Still, he finds the ability to walk out of the door each morning and smile at the sky. 

Hirayama clings to a past version of himself. Much of the film is about him learning to love what still is and to let go of what has passed. With family, much remains unsaid, with only his niece, Niko, providing any hints.

You thought I was joking about Wim Wenders wanting to make a movie about the toilets? That's exactly how it started. The Tokyo Toilet Project believed he would direct a short, not a full-length film. 

The film is structurally pretty weak. Too much time is spent on establishing Hirayama's rituals before the deviations are allowed to enter. From a screenplay perspective, they could have integrated the scenes more and cut at least a half-hour from the two-hour movie.

The soundtrack is shitty classic rock from the 60s and 70s. I hated every time one of his tapes played. It wasn't until after the movie that I wished for shoegaze. I wanted a movie to replace <i>Lost in Translation</i> as a Tokyo vibes film.

Waves crash against the rocks. A house sits on the rocky ridge above. Cecilia (Elisabeth Moss) gets out of bed to dispose of the Diazepam-laced water she gave Adrian (Oliver Jackson-Cohen). She tip-toes through their technically advanced house to grab a tote bag, disable the cameras and the alarm system, and sneak out. She passes through Adrian’s optics lab, where he developed optic and augmentation technology. Her sister Emily (Harriet Dyer) meets her on the main road. Cecilia closes the passenger door, and Adrian punches through the passenger-side window. Emily speeds off.

<b>Two Weeks Later</b>
Cecilia stays with her friend James (Aldis Hodge) and James’ daughter, Sydney (Storm Reid). Cecilia tries to go for a run but sees another man running. Worried it might be Adrian, she rushes back into the house. Emily comes over against Cecilia’s wishes — Adrian could track Emily because he knows where she lives. But Emily tells her that Adrian is dead. The investigation ruled a suicide.

Cecilia doesn’t believe it. She tells Emily about how controlling Adrian was — deciding what she wore or ate or where she went and when. If she didn’t obey him, he could hit her, among other things.

Adrian’s will gives Cecilia $5 million, which she had to show up in person to claim. Back at home, Cecilia notices odd things — inconsistencies. Her conclusion is horrifying and feels impossible, but there's no better explanation. Adrian faked his death and developed a tool to make him invisible.

How will Cecilia prove it and get the help she needs? Or will she have to take matters into her own hands?

Elisabeth Moss gave an outstanding performance that had me connected to her and emotionally invested. Cecilia's situation feels hopeless, and it would take a monster not to root for her, but Moss gives it that extra mile and makes it feel real.

The cinematography creates such anticipation by drawing lines of sight and moving to spaces where no one is. The camera sees what we can't.

The runtime felt indulgent initially, but as it took its turns and developed, it all came together nicely. The ending is a chef's kiss on the lips.

Margaret (Valerie Leon) tosses in her bed.

From the night sky, the camera pulls back to expose a cliff face. Into the cliffside, we go to see Queen Tera (Valerie Leon) passed out and dressed in the horniest Egyptian garb imaginable.

A priest drips a black substance into her nose, putting her into a state of suspended animation. They remove her hand and take it outside to feed to wild dogs. The priests lay the cover on her sarcophagus. The hand escapes the dogs, crawling along the sand, the red ring on its finger shimmering in the moonlight. 

Once the priests leave and seal the tomb, a strong wind blows, tearing into their necks like animal bites and killing them.

Margaret startles awake. Her father, Professor Julian Fuchs (Andrew Keir), comes in to comfort her — the same nightmare comes to her every night. After she dresses and comes down the stairs, her father gives her an early birthday gift — Queen Tera's red ring.

Little does he know the power the ring has. The ring pulls Margaret into the sway of an ancient evil that threatens to break free after centuries of dormancy.

This movie was such a disaster during production.

Because of his wife's diagnosis of emphysema, Peter Cushing had to leave after one day of filming. Andrew Keir stepped in to do his best Cushing imitation, which is honestly pretty good.

Original director Seth Holt died of a heart attack during the shoot. Michael Carreras, Hammer producer James Carreras's son, stepped in and found that the footage was a mess — this is likely because of Chris Wicking's script, which Seth Holt had to rewrite as they filmed.

Thankfully, Hammer was over twenty years in and could apply their signature gothic style to hide the unsightly seams. I wouldn't call this an inspired movie, but it scratches an itch that only Hammer films seem to scratch.","plex, hooptober, hooptober7.0, britsploitation",2024-02-27

Reverend Luther Williams (Sam Waymon) is a chauffeur for Dr. Hess Green (Duane Jones). Williams describes Dr. Green as a blood addict — a victim of a disease.

<blockquote><i>And Jesus said unto them, ""Who so eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life. And I will raise him up at the last day. For my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and I in them.""</i></blockquote>

Dr. Green receives a new assistant named George Meda (Bill Gunn). Meda feels proud to be in Dr. Green's employment. Meda moves into Dr. Green's mansion.

<blockquote><i>By the Christians, it is written that in the Black Myrthian Age, there existed an addition to blood among its people. Thousands of slaves are bled to death but murdered in such a way the slaves could not die. There was visited upon them a curse that they should live forever unless the shadow of a cross, an implement of torture, touched their darkened heart. But oh! Since Christ had not come yet, and the cross did not exist, don't you know they were called to walk the earth 'til the Christians came? The blood of the thing is the truth of the thing. They had come to be addicted to truth 'til the Christians came.</i></blockquote>

One night, Meda gets drunk and climbs into a tree. A noose hangs from the limbs. Meda confides in Dr. Green with his suicidal tendencies. But later that night, Meda attacks Dr. Green, stabbing him with a ceremonial dagger. He writes a lengthy suicide note and kills himself.

Dr. Green did not die. His chest bears no wounds. He discovers Meda's body and picks up the phone. He hangs up the phone and instead drinks Meda's blood.

The film follows Dr. Green's journey as a vampire and the relationship that blooms between him and Meda's estranged wife, Ganja (Marlene Clark).

The film has an unconventional structure and pace, where events happen out of sequence. The story is open-ended, so interpretation can unfold indefinitely. It fluctuates between story and delirium, pulling you in without a clear direction.

The producers approached director Bill Gunn to make a ""black vampire film."" Gunn took creative control and directed the vampire metaphor to one of addiction. The metaphor goes deeper than that, drawing on Christian allegory and mythmaking to create a distinctly Black vampirism.

This film is a rare and incredible piece of Black filmmaking.

Frank (William Sadler) speeds down a New Mexico road. The Collector (Billy Zane) follows close behind. The fuel gauge is empty. Frank turns his car perpendicular to the road and shoots at The Collector's car. The car catches fire but doesn't slow. Frank jumps out as the car collides with his car, exploding into a heap of fire and metal.

Filter's Hey Man Nice Shot plays as Frank hobbles into the New Mexico desert. He makes it to the town of Wormwood. Uncle Willy (Dick Miller) finds Frank and shares some of his hooch. Willy offers Frank a place to stay at a church converted into a boarding house, where a merry band of misfits live together.

The Collector emerges and warns them about Frank — that Frank is a dangerous thief of an ancient relic. They go to the boarding house to arrest Frank. They find the relic and try to arrest both Frank and The Collector. So, The Collector punches through Tupper's face and rips his head off, causing Irene to puke. Frank takes the relic and presses it to The Collector's face, which sends him away.

The Collector condemns the property, spilling his neon green blood on the ground. The blood oozes and emits flames, congealing together into demons — tortured slaves of hell. So, Frank rallies them — so long as they stick together, they'll make it through the night. But The Collector has a few tricks up his sleeve.

The movie's lore is extensive. It's weird and sacrilegious, and I love it.

The film opens at Gartley's Blue Ribbon Laundry service, just outside of Riker's Valley, Maine. At the center is a massive laundry press — the titular Mangler.

Sherry tries to tighten the belt on the machine, cutting her hand. The blood splashes into the press's tread. The machine emits electric bolts, nearly killing her. Still, Mr. Gartley, watching it all unfold, tells everyone to get back to work.

Mrs. Frawley tries to take some antacids, but they fall onto the machine. She reaches to retrieve them, but the machine sucks her in, crushing her to bits. A bloody flesh cube falls out the other end.

Rebecca opens her eyes, recalling scenes from a science lab. She wanders through a white cube. Each of the six surfaces has eight panels, all glowing white. The ninth panel in the center of each surface has a hatch. Each panel interconnects with bars that allow her to climb up the walls.

She enters another room through one hatch. As though gravity itself inverted, she pulls up and slams against the ceiling.

Thomas opens a hatch, looking for the serial numbers that show the positioning of the room relative to the grid. He isn't wearing a shoe — he has tested a room for a trap. However, it differs from the prison in <i>Cube</i>. This is a <b>H Y P E R C U B E</b>. 

<blockquote><i>I want a chance! Don't I get a chance like the others?</i></blockquote>

Kate finds Simon passed out. He stirs, pulling a knife on her and pinning her down. Each of the hatch doors open. Max appears at each door. Kate slips away and opens the door Max went through. However, there is no one there. The hatch closes behind her. She goes to open it, and now Simon is gone.

Going through more rooms, Kate finds Sasha curled up in the corner. Sasha is blind and horrified. Jerry crawls up through the floor. Despite hours of roaming, he has only discovered four rooms. A ""Lost smoke monster"" type noise erupts just above them.

Jerry craws through a panel to find Max trying to stop Thomas from hanging himself. Everyone we've met thus far comes into the room and helps Max. They learn Thomas is a colonel for the Department of Defense. Thomas has bruises all over his body, and there are cigarette burns on his palm.

Finally, a hatch opens, and Mrs. Paley comes through. She asks where the showers are, thinking she's in a health club. The noise erupts again. Sasha says:

<blockquote><i>It's coming closer</i></blockquote>

Straight away, the substantially lower budget is clear. The cubes are simpler in design. To avoid complex math for room positioning in the tesseract, every room is the same.

The performances are similarly stilted to <i>Cube</i>, and the script is as weak. 

I am highly tolerant of cheap special effects, especially when they serve a function that would be impossible in practical effects. This movie has a bit of each, so it's a mixed bag. If you can tolerate the effects, they're the best part.

A woman in red pulls a book from her bag — <i>Driven: Obsession and Compulsion in Everyday Life</i> by Dr. Margaret Ford (Lindsay Crouse). She turns the book, finding the author's photo at the back. Another woman buys coffee nearby. Sure enough, it's Dr. Ford. The woman in red chases after Dr. Ford, stopping her so that Dr. Ford may sign her book.

Cut to Dr. Ford taking notes in a session with Katherine.

<blockquote><i>— I'm talking to you. Do you think that you're exempt?
— That I'm exempt from what?
— Experience. </i></blockquote>

Dr. Ford meets with her mentor, Dr. Maria Littauer, to discuss her findings with Katherine. Dr. Ford tries to rush off, but Dr. Littauer tells her to slow down and appreciate her recent success from her book.

Her next client, Billy Hahn, talks about his compulsive gambling. Again, he points to Dr. Ford's life as merely talking and not helping anyone. He pulls a pistol out of his pocket.

<blockquote><i>— You want to help me? You can't help because, babe, you don't know what trouble is.
— Billy, I swear to you. Give me the gun, and I will help you.</i></blockquote>

Billy hands it over and discloses that he owes a substantial amount of gambling debt. If he doesn't pay it tomorrow, a man named Mike (Joe Mantegna) will kill him.

Later that night, Dr. Ford remains true to her word. She confronts Mike at his establishment, The House of Games. Straight away, we see the situation isn't as Billy painted it. Still, Dr. Ford takes the bait and agrees to Mike's terms. She gets a taste for a thrill that she cannot escape.

The best con movies reveal everything from the start. If you see it, you experience the thrill of seeing everything come together. If you don't, you get the pleasure of the revelation. Some will trade the clever clockwork for knotty twists, like <i>Oceans Eleven</i>. Others smugly show their cards at the end, assuming the audience is too stupid to put it together, like <i>The Usual Suspects</i>.

Mamet provides both avenues through his movie — if you've seen the same films he has, then the moment Mike shows up, you know what's happening. Otherwise, Dr. Ford is your surrogate, and you ride with her.

The classic noir soundtrack with the cymbal hiss is satisfying.

The movie's psychotherapy is nonsense that only serves the plot. Not only that, but every character is equally intimate with Freudian psychoanalysis. It's a tad trite.

A construction crew intends to blow up a castle and replace it with a nuclear plant. Before they can, a black horse-drawn carriage erupts from the gates.  The carriage holds a coffin — inside, the Baron Roderico.

The carriage driver encloses the coffin in a shipping container at Frankfurt. The container will go to the Baron's last nephew in Italy, Count Osvaldo Lambertenghi. After ensuring the container's safety, the carriage driver jumps in front of a train and commits suicide.

Meanwhile, Count Osvaldo signs over his castle to be turned into a hotel. With nowhere to go, Osvaldo becomes a bellhop for the hotel. The gardener, Lellina, whom Osvaldo secretly loves, has no such luck, and the hotel fires her.

Osvaldo believes his luck will change after receiving a letter from his Uncle Roderico, saying that Osvaldo is Roderico's heir. At midnight, Roderico emerges from his coffin, and Osvaldo learns the truth — his uncle is a vampire!

One year after his debut as Dracula for Hammer, Christopher Lee travels across Europe to be in his first Italian picture. They dub Lee's voice with someone else, so it has an uncanny quality.

Christopher Lee is nearly twice as tall as Renato Rascel. That might be the funniest part of the movie.

Rascel's physicality transcends the language barrier. He's a goofy little guy — not my sense of humor, but amusing.

Hans van Arnim arrived by boat at a remote island in Holland. He seeks out Professor Wahl, a famous sculptor. Wahl maintains what the locals call the Mill of the Stone Women — a carousel of wax figures in distressing scenes.

Hans is writing a piece on the carousel, and he must finish it before the installation's centennial.

Grim statues fill the professor's studio, including one of a nude woman hanging from a rope.

Hans meets Wahl's daughter, Elfie. She behaves strangely, but Hans is into it, to the chagrin of his girlfriend, Lisolette. Elfie asks him to meet her at the windmill at night. But when Elfie sees Hans with Lisolette, she demands to have him to herself. They argue, and she dies in his arms.

But things are not as they appear. Is Hans ill, or something sinister at play? 

The movie has a perfect gothic tone, with beautiful sets and costumes. Being the first Italian horror movie shot in color, they went all out.

In the post-apocalyptic wasteland of 2021, roving gangs fight for survival. After an army kills her brother, Marya sends her hawk to find help as she seeks somewhere to hide.

When a man tries to claim her, the Sisterhood helps her out. The Sisterhood is a nomadic band of women warriors with unique psychic abilities. Led by Alee, who has the power to move objects with her mind, the women seek to liberate the women of the wasteland and heal the war-torn land.

When Marya reveals she can speak to and understand her hawk, the other members invite her to join them on their quest to rescue the remaining members of The Sisterhood.

The main actors are solid and hold the movie together, especially when the flailing kid actors threaten to bring the scene to a crashing halt. Lynn-Holly Johnson gives the top performance, having the closest thing to a character.

The movie also has stakes and isn't afraid to kill kids. So, even if the emotional scenes don't land, they feel earned.

The music is cheesy, and the fight choreography is pretty awful. The camera leers in uncomfortable ways at The Sisterhood. Whatever the movie's intentions, dudes made it horny.

The third act is where most of the budget is — it goes full <i>Fury Road</i> with wacky vehicles. military tanks, and explosions. It isn't as exciting as it sounds, but it's enough to get me to the finish line.

2024-03-04,Dune: Part Two,2024,https://boxd.it/5YmxdL,4,,"Frank Herbert's biggest regret about Dune was that he didn't make it obvious enough that it was a tragedy. So, to clarify his intentions, he wrote Dune Messiah, which emphasizes just how terrible the consequences of Paul's ascendancy were.

When Denis Villeneuve approached Warner Bros. to make Dune, he proposed three movies: two for Dune and one for Dune Messiah. Warner Bros. only signed off on two of them, leaving the possibility of a third likely but uncertain.

In writing the script, Villeneuve also intended his movies to address Herbert's regret and make the tragedy more apparent. But he still wants to adapt Dune Messiah. As we reach the end of the book in the movie, we sense the storyteller's longing to express more, with no clue as to what else they could say.

Now, we know a third movie is coming. And we have been so inundated with multi-part movies that seeing two functionally incomplete films doesn't feel as disappointing as it might have.

I am not disappointed — I've read the books and knew it would end where it ended. I expected a smoother ending, like the first movie, rather than abruptly rolling the credits at the climax.

Denis Villeneuve took on this project and gave the book fans the adaptation they've waited decades for. The second movie couldn't awe me like the first, but it was still satisfying to watch.

As she heads back to her dorm, a werewolf emerges from the woods and chases after her.

With Mary dead, everyone tries to figure out who (or what) did it. Those who know Alfred's secret affair with Mary think it was him. Another girl finds out about Julian losing his license because of a young girl dying under his care. On the other hand, there are wolves outside.

The plot is soapy, with every development strung out of convoluted conversation. Everyone has a different secret, but only one will reveal who the werewolf is. Waiting for them to figure it out is a slog.

The dubbing of the leads is solid, but the minor characters are pretty awful. The performances are better than the dubbed words coming out of their mouths.

A group circles Catherine, a medium for some spectral presence. Thunder strikes as she speaks in a foreign tongue. Dr. John Hichcock translates:

<blockquote><i>The black mark of death is on this house.</i></blockquote>

Dr. Charles Livingstone administers a shot to John — a quick-acting poison. Charles forces an antidote down John's throat, reminding him that this process may cure whatever ailment denies John the use of his legs.

John suspects Charles is having an affair with John's wife, Margaret. Regardless, Margaret finds spending time with John increasingly unbearable. After putting John to bed, Margaret meets Charles in another part of the house and kisses him. Margaret begs Charles to kill John once and for all. So, with Margaret's help, Charles administers a much higher dosage of the poison.

After John's funeral, they hear strange sounds in the house. John's wheelchair squeaks and tumbles down the stairs. They hear John's voice calling for Margaret but find Catherine in a trance, speaking in his voice. Though they are done with John, he is not finished with them.

<blockquote><i>Know then that the ASTRAL BODY shall remain firmly bound to the EARTHLY BODY and e'en at times shall so materialise[sp], taking to itself the very semblance of the dead person in so that he shall verily appear to be alive and yet incorporate.</i></blockquote>

The film has a strong, Gothic tone. A skull sits on almost every table in each room. A music box plays the movie's theme (which is very good).

The movie doesn't use all the seeds it plants and takes a leisurely pace between plot points. If you've seen enough of these movies, you may figure out the conclusion early, making the film feel longer.

Still, this is a solid Italian Gothic film — perhaps not great, but enjoyable for its mood. Barbara Steele's performance adds a lot of flair, especially during the climax.

Three men ride into town as the church bells ring. The men enter a barbershop where a father and son work. They stuff the son's mouth with soap and the father's full of shaving cream.

Jack Beauregard (Henry Fonda) is on his way to Europe, ready to retire in peace. He goes to the barbershop for a shave. The man who lathers him up is one of the men who rode in on horseback — the other two watch from outside.

The man in the barbershop tests the razor's sharpness before bringing it to Jack's face. Jack points a gun at the man to ensure he doesn't do anything funny. The men outside ready their pistols. While Jack cleans his face, one man shoots through the window. Before they can do anything, Jack draws his gun and disposes of the men.

Once Jack leaves, the barber's son asks if there's anybody faster than Jack

<blockquote><i>Faster than him? Nobody.</i></blockquote>In a lake, a man kills a cricket and puts it on the water. He then grabs a large branch, waiting for a fish to come for the cricket. Jack rides by and sees the man bring the stick down into the water and come up with a fish in his hands.

Later, one of the dozens of men trying to kill Jack finds the man and makes him a deal — bring a basket to Jack and get a horse in return. The man brings the basket to Jack, revealing that he knows of Jack's feats. He tells Jack about his plan to take on all 150 members of The Wild Bunch and how he wants Jack to join in. Jack asks for his name.

<blockquote><i>Who, me? Nobody!</i></blockquote>I love the delightful Morricone score. It enhances the sense of playfulness at the heart of the movie. 

Is Terrence Hill funny or just handsome? Regardless, Nobody is a goofy character and makes me laugh.

That's what is most impressive about this movie — a 70s Italian import whose sense of humor still translates. It's not a laugh riot, 

Henry Fonda's straight-man routine is a little too flat for me.

John Landis doing the stunts/set pieces makes sense — the physical humor sometimes reminds me of Animal House.

The end is a bit of a cop-out, putting most of the action in stills and montage, but it fits.

While this has its flaws, its warm-hearted style is rare in Westerns.

An angel carrying an egg is sent to Earth to determine if humanity is worth saving. Meanwhile, Frank and Goose scavenge the irradiated land for supplies. But the earth is a cruel place, and survival is a game of luck.

This movie is loosely based on <i>Angel's Egg</i> and incorporates footage from the OVA. The director's goal was to take the highly surreal and ""incomprehensible"" anime they had acquired the rights to and make something that general audiences could understand. So, they filmed live-action footage to pair with the anime and dubbed the anime segments with newly written lines.

The result is... hard to pin down. Like, it's insanely cheap. The filmmakers shot all of the live footage at one factory. But it doesn't look terrible. And the transitions from animated to live-action are kind of neat.

It feels like the live-action footage they would integrate with video games in the 90s.

This movie didn't get any distribution outside of the UK until 2019, so I can't imagine they made money on this.

Cyro arrives in Rome on a flight from Beirut. Marco meets him, and they go looking for Carlo. They believe Carlo is trying to blackmail them, even though Carlo insists Alma stole the incriminating documents from him.

They find Carlo and shoot him in the shoulder before he escapes down an alley and into a monastery. There, Carlo explains the situation to Father Pejo Renigio while the Father tends to Carlo's bullet wound.

Carlo believes Alma intends to blackmail Cryo and ruin his life and his daughter Jenny's marriage with Gugo. Carlo will kill her before she can.

Cut to a restaurant with song and dance during the meals. After two unrelated numbers, we get Alma Del Rio, who does a low-effort dance number. After her performance, she meets Father Renigio in her dressing room. He begs her to return the documents. When she refuses, the Father tells her why he became a monk.

""A castle to drink in,"" sings one girl.

Despite the cobwebs and silence, they find a large hall with lit candelabras and a table of food and liquor. They gorge themselves. Pejo lights the fireplace, and they dance to Gugo playing drums.

An ageless figure emerges from the shadows to watch them dance. He sits by the fire, watching it rage.

Finally, at fifteen minutes to midnight, the figure stops the dance. He tells the group about a woman whose hair is like water and how he sold his soul to the Devil so that they could live forever. But she didn't want it, so her spirit lives on, begging for a proper burial. At midnight, he will lose his soul forever, so he begs the group to help him find her. If they agree, they will possess the castle and its riches.

The group mocks him, but the idea of getting rich motivates them.

It only took 45 minutes, but we got to a plot! The movie won't resolve these plotlines, I'm afraid.

The flashback surpasses the framing story, which only exists to fill time. Its camera work is much better, and the acting performances are… slightly better.

<b>Oh no, <i>Succession</i> ruined Matthew Macfadyen.</b>

Elizabeth Bennet walks across a sun-soaked field, reading the last page of a beloved book. Passing through the moat, she weaves through linens hung out to dry and past the door of Longbourn, the Bennet's estate. Inside, Mary plays the piano. Jane carries her needlework as Lydia and Kitty run by chasing one another.

Mr. and Mrs. Bennet discuss the letting of Netherfield Park by the wealthy bachelor, Charles Bingley. The Bennet sisters gather outside the door, swooning at the prospect of their father marrying off one of them to Mr. Bingley. Mr. Bennet will allow Mr. Bingley to choose at the assembly ball the following day.

At the ball, Elizabeth shares with Jane her belief that all men are ""humorless poppycocks,"" while Jane assures her they're not all bad.

<blockquote><i>One of these days, Lizzie, someone will catch your eye, and then you'll have to watch your tongue.</i></blockquote>The ball quiets as Mr. Bingley, his sister Caroline, and the furrow-browed Mr. Darcy enter. Mr. Darcy glances at Elizabeth before turning away. Elizabeth pauses before letting out a quiet laugh. Straight away, Mr. Bingley and Jane take to each other. Elizabeth tries to dance with Mr. Darcy, but he shrugs her off. Later, she overhears Mr. Darcy complaining about Elizabeth's looks. Mrs. Bennett confirms how plain Elizabeth is.

And so begins the story of, among other things, the romance between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy.

Fans of Jane Austen's novel will find plenty to complain about. For one, Bennet's turn from landed gentry to country folk unfamiliar with custom undoes much of the meticulous nature of the book.

The filmmakers trade Austen's sense of humor and wit for a more swooning and Romantic-with-a-capital-R expressiveness. And, at nearly a third the length of the beloved 1995 miniseries, it was impossible to include the depth of character and subtle changes that the miniseries possessed.

If you accept the changes, the film is a joyful and warm journey. The energy is teen movie adjacent, dealing with people who are too dumb to understand their feelings. The romance between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy will always make me feel a little icky — the ""you think you hate them, but you actually love them"" schtick isn't my bag.

Still, the movie has a beautiful style and cinematography. Joe Wright will always prioritize that over a story, as <i>Atonement</i> can attest.

It also has a delightful sense of humor, although quite mean-spirited.

God, I hate Mr. Collins.

Overall, I completely understand why people love this movie. While I don't love it, it's a stunning image with moving performances.

In Old Scotland, a horse-drawn carriage ambles along a muddied dirt road through an empty field, save for a farmhouse down the way. Yep, that's a horse-drawn carriage. After a minute of watching the carriage, it stops at the Rooster Inn. The coachman can tend to the horses, and the riders can grab a bite.

Jenkins, Mary, and Fred order hot food. Inn patrons wonder why Americans are in the country.

The restaurant goes quiet as Inspector Wright and a police officer enter. Betty, their server, tells the group that the police are looking for a leper named Quick, who escaped from the leper colony. Quick was a friend of Sir Reginald, the owner of the Nofis Castle before Sir Reginald died.

Through talking with Betty, they all determine that they are going to Nofis Castle for the reading of Sir Reginald's will. Sir Reginald lay in the family crypt, in the seventh grave. The police did not perform an autopsy.

You'll notice the similarities if you are familiar with <i>The Cat and The Canary</i>. This story is essentially the same, with few changes. The primary difference is an escaped leper instead of an escaped murderer.

The movie is slow and poorly filmed but has a consistent atmosphere and decent performances.

Jigsaw has imprisoned Detective Eric Matthews in the Saw™️ bathroom. The room is pitch black, save for his flashlight. He looks around and sees dead bodies. Then, he spots the titular saw™️ and a severed foot rotting in an ankle cuff. Rather than saw his foot off, he uses the toilet seat to break his foot so he can slide it out of the chain.

Meanwhile, a SWAT team led by Officer Rigg discovers the scene of a Jigsaw game with the scattered remnants of a human body. In this trap, the victim had to rip chains from his body to escape a bomb. Unlike previous Jigsaw traps, however, escape was impossible, even following the rules. The abductor had welded the door shut.

Detective Kerry arrives, hoping it is Eric — at least she could have closure. At night, she sees his face, haunted by his inability to save him. Kerry stays up, watching the recovered tape from the trap. A pig-masked assailant captures her and traps her in a room glowing Jigsaw's Signature Trap Green™️.

Kerry follows the instructions, retrieving a key from a beaker of acid. But it does not free her from the trap. A person in red walks into the room, their face obscured. ""You,"" Kerry whimpers before the trap rips the skin from her torso.

Why has John Kramer, aka JIGSAW, changed his pattern? Or is someone else taking the reins? If you remember the previous movie, you know who took over.

I haven't seen <i>Saw I</i> or <i>II</i> since they came out, so I don't know if my opinions about the previous movies would change.

This color grading is outrageous — it's like Tony Scott on downers — but that was 2006 for you.

I appreciate the practical effects! Some aren't top-tier, but they enhance the intensity. The traps are so bonkers — I don't remember if they're more outrageous than anything from the previous films, but it feels like it.

This movie is the one that introduces a full-blown plot and continuity. Screenwriter Leigh Whannel created a twisted father-daughter story between John and Amanda. As a result, the movie chases emotional impact over mondo twists.

The movie has one of the more straightforward traps — save this woman who witnessed your son's murder or don't. It's the most overt morality choice from the franchise thus far. It's also the most exploitative, with the woman naked and the camera keeping her body in the frame.

The ""rotting pigs in the grinder"" trap is so disgusting that it's funny. Similarly, the skull surgery scene is visceral as fuck.

This has long bouts of truly boring nothing — circular arguments and people wandering.

Shawnee Smith kills it as Amanda — she's the best part of this movie.

The movie watches the events afterward, including the trial, to determine if Sandra is the cause of Samuel's death.

The movie mimics patterns from true crime movies and TV — a shaking, uncertain camera trying to capture everything, reenactments of events and conversations by the characters, and all of the media speculation surrounding it.

Being a French production, you know it'll be ambiguous about some aspects of the story. I won't say or hint at which. I will say that the movie is a rollercoaster.

And that's both its biggest strength and flaw. On the one hand, by performing these patterns, we get pulled into the drama of it. But by heightening everything, it feels manipulative, regardless of intent.

I compared it in my head with <i>Saint-Omer</i>, a similar movie but done with so much more subtlety and grace that this felt borderline hammy by comparison.

I still think it's a terrific script. The film has outstanding performances, including the best dog actor I've seen.

Mathias is an innkeeper and owns the village mill. He wishes to be the burgomaster in Alstia. So, he offers local leaders credited food and alcohol but does not collect. His wife, Catherine, worries about their debt because of his favors.

Jerome Frantz owns much of Mathias’s debt. Frantz will forgive Mathias’s debt if he can marry Mathais’s daughter, Annette. Mathias refuses, intent on finding his way. 

The snowstorm builds as everyone finds warmth indoors. Baruch Koweski, a merchant from Warsaw, asks to stay at the inn for an hour to warm up. Mathias drinks with him for a bit. He plots a way to take the merchant’s money to pay off his debts.

Then, as Baruch leaves, Mathias trails behind him. Before Baruch can board his sleigh and go, Mathias strikes him on the head with an axe. Baruch, as he is dying, rings the sleigh bells.

Mathias takes the coin off of Baruch’s dead body. Mathias may get what he wants, but the bells will haunt him.

Jamie (Margaret Qualley) has the incurable itch of needing to fuck anyone willing. Her girlfriend, Sukie (Beanie Feldstein), is less than thrilled about it. Sukie ends the relationship and kicks Jamie out of the apartment.

Marian (Geraldine Viswanathan) has found little luck in love. She hasn't had sex since the Nader presidential campaign. She plans a trip to Tallahassee, Florida, to visit her aunt Marian. Jamie tags along, whether Marian likes it or not.

If you told me that the Farrelly brothers directed this movie, I would believe you. But no, this is one half of the Coen brothers, Ethan Coen, directing his first film without Joel. And boy, does it show.

For all the wackiness found in a Coen brothers comedy, it also showed SOME restraint. Here, we have an id without a superego — a horny, sloppy road movie that's more fun in theory. Think Russ Meyer with more than one thing on his mind.

Margaret Qualley's choice of accent comes straight out of <i>Raising Arizona </i>— a Southern that gets pinned to Texas but belongs only to theater majors. It's a lot to take for the first act. Once things start, it gets easier to handle.

Geraldine Viswanathan doesn't get much to do besides be a party pooper, but she gets some hot-and-heavy scenes that allow her to break out.

The movie drops out of the story for brief psychedelic trips a la <i>The Big Lebowski</i> — they're uninspired but still better than the psych-out scenes from <i>Infinity Pool</i>.

That said, the movie is both funny and horny. For all its flaws, it's nice to see a film where feminine desire is the primary driving force behind the story.

The French army puts a Cambodian priest named Tsiang on trial. He claims he can raise an army of zombies capable of taking out a trench of soldiers. We cut to a scene of warfare in which French soldiers shoot at Cambodian men. Bullets turn their skin to mesh, but the Cambodian men do not falter. The witnesses claim the Cambodians seek to wipe out the white race. So, they sentence Tsiang to life in prison.

Tsiang tries to burn the parchment containing the location of the ""Secret of the Zombies,"" but General Mazovia kills him before he can finish and steals the parchment.

After the war, an expedition assembles to find and destroy the secret formula. But this is the 30s, so we get a heaping pile of love triangles and South Asian exoticism to pad out the 64-minute runtime.

We watch Jigsaw's silly traps and learn Amanda could not have been Jigsaw's only apprentice. It seems like it's one of the officers who is investigating the Jigsaw murders.

Ella lets the girl dictate the story's direction, taking her down a bizarre path where the line between art and life disintegrates.

The motivation for how we get to Ella's ""Lost Girl"" film feels flimsy — like, if she isn't making her mother's film, why is she making anything?

It's all to motivate the theme of artist vs. craftsperson — the ability to make vs. the ability to invent. The film also explores how animation turns its creators into puppets, performing their routines to arrive at work. Or perhaps the filmmaker just wants an excuse to throw these weird and gross images together.

<blockquote><i>Old legends — strange tales — never die in the lonely swamp land. Villages and hamlets lie remote and almost forgotten. Small ferryboats glide between the shores, and the ferryman is a very important person. Day and night, he is at the command of his passengers. On his little barge ride the good and the evil; the friendly and the hostile; the superstitious and the enlightened; the living and sometimes — the dead.</i></blockquote>

Three men pull themselves across the swamp water along the toe-rope. They produce a fourth man, dead and only wearing swim briefs. They carry the dead man into the town. Bill Craig — drowned, found in the swamp near the ferry. A collection of vines and weeds wrap around Bill's neck, acting as the natural noose that strangled the life out of him.

Bill Craig is the latest in a series of choking-related accidents resulting in death. Bill Jenkins was thrown from his horse and choked to death by the reins. Shelton was hanged by the pulley rope that hung in his hayloft. Henry Craig, strangled by his fishnet.

Years ago, after a murder, the townspeople accused the ferryman, Douglas. Douglas tried to convince the town that he was innocent, but the people acted swiftly and sentenced him to death by hanging. As Douglas hanged, he uttered a curse: that his spirit would return to strangle his hangmen and all of their descendants.

Jonathan Harker boards a train to Bistritz. He chats with a fellow on the train, telling him that he's a lawyer who is seeing one of his firm's clients, Count Dracula.

<blockquote><i>My dear sir, may God preserve you because if you go to visit Count Dracula, you may need God's help.</i></blockquote>A carriage brings Jonathan from the station to an inn that the Count secured for him. During the night, while he tosses and turns in his bed, the innkeeper's wife comes to Jonathan with a warning.

<blockquote><i>Tomorrow is St. George's night. When the clock strikes midnight, all the evils of the world circle around us.</i></blockquote>The following day, everyone looks at Jonathan strangely. They know his destination.

From here, the story follows Bram Stoker's novel rather faithfully. The primary difference is that, in this movie, Dracula starts older and gets younger when he drinks blood.

The mood is dreadful, almost to a cartoonish degree. You could convince me this is a parody if it weren't so slow. 

The sets are gothic, albeit sparse in detail. The cobwebs are so intense that they seem to fall into food on the table — every nook and cranny has them.

The vampire women arising from their graves have a haunting quality, the way their bodies turn from translucent to corporal. But from there, it loses that feeling and returns to book recitation.

With Jesús Franco and Klaus Kinski involved you'd think this would be hornier. At least Christopher Lee gives us some furrowed brow dramatics.

The stuffed animals coming alive is hysterical.

<blockquote><i>The ancients, who wrote in the Sanskrit tongue, gave first mention of the strange drug we call Nind Andhera. This drug was first introduced into the city of Lahore in the Punjab in the 703rd year after the death of the prophet, praise his memory. This drug has the power to place a man's body and limbs into helplessness. And his soul sleeps, nor does he feel pain. He is as a dead man, yet is not of the dead.</i></blockquote>

Dr. Cadman comes to visit Dr. Gordon Ramsay (seriously), a former student to be executed for murder.  Cadman will take Ramsay's body to his estate. Except Cadman offers a way past the ""death"" part. He opens the top of his cane and pours Nind Andhera into a cup for Ramsay. Cadman calls it The Black Sleep.

The following day, the guards find Ramsay, and his heart stopped. They prepare his body and send it to Cadman. Cadman, with the assistance of Odo, opens the coffin and administers a shot to Ramsay's body. Ramsay startles back to life.

Ramsay becomes Cadman's assistant, knowing little more than that Cadman is working to advance the field of brain surgery. They go to Cadman's estate, where Ramsay learns the full extent of Ramsay's research and the horrifying victims left in his wake.

The movie is quite dry, as it tries to present its ideas systematically. It gets more interesting as we learn the extent of Cadman's experiments, including one of John Carradine's most outrageous performances.

Two rowers transport Roberto to a village with a villa. Alfred, also called Seargent, meets Roberto and helps with the luggage. Count Montebruno greets Roberto as he arrives at the villa. The Count confesses to Roberto his desire for the lake legend to be true, hoping Roberto would face a mishap on his trip there.

The Count shares with Roberto the drought they are experiencing, with the lake reaching its lowest level in two hundred years. As a result, the remnants of a tragedy nearly forgotten reemerged — a statue. Legend has it that the statue curses the island resident.

The Count hired Roberto, a sculptor and former resident of the island, to perform a restoration on the statue. He intends for the mansion to be ready for his niece, Harriet.

The butler, William, rushes in, informing The Count and Roberto that the two boatsmen who brought Roberto have died. Their boat mysteriously overturned, and they could not swim to safety. They were the ones who salvaged the statue.

As the days pass and Harriet arrives, mishaps and bizarre occurrences continue. As Roberto restores the statue, he cannot help but notice that Harriet and the statue bear a striking resemblance.

Barbara Steele does a tremendous job. Her character has an unusual tone and behavior shift that reminds me of Jenna Maroney. But it works for the weird vibes this movie has.

Eight-year-old kids yell and play while they wait for their teacher to arrive. Once the teacher arrives, he chastises the kids for making a racket. He also scolds Nematzadeh for repeatedly forgetting to use his notebook for his homework. Ahmad, who sits beside Nematzadeh, watches as the teacher rips up Nematzadeh's homework, driving the child to tears. 

Nematzadeh's cousin, who came in late from the long-off village of Poshteh, reveals he had the notebook and that Nematzadeh left it at his house by mistake. The teacher uses Ahmad's homework as an example of what to do, then threatens to expel Nematzadeh if he forgets his notebook again.

After school, Ahmad and Nematzadeh run outside. Nematzadeh falls, dropping his notebook. Ahmad helps him up and checks his knees for scrapes.

When Ahmad gets home, his mother gives him chores to do before he can do his homework. No matter which order he does it in, his. mother punishes him.

When Ahmad finally gets to his homework, he realizes that when Nematzadeh fell, he picked up both notebooks. He tries to explain the situation and potential expulsion to his mother. She thinks he's lying and refuses to let him out. So, when she goes inside, Ahmad runs outside to find Poshteh and to return Nematzadeh's notebook to him.

This movie is the most empathetic rendition of a Kafkaesque bureaucracy.

In one case, we see the labyrinth of discipline and expectations that keep a child from succeeding. As we come across children, we contrast their treatment in school versus at home. Ahmad is a star student at school, yet his mother only sees him as a lying troublemaker. The teacher scolds Morteza, who tries to lie down in class because of a hurt back, while at home we see him performing back-breaking chores.

In another case, we see the puzzle of getting to Nematzadeh's house. Ahmad gets directions from people that don't line up with reality. Or, when he asks for help, he gets ignored. He finds clues that lead to dead ends. Despite his best efforts, the right thing is always out of reach.

For example, Ahmad's grandfather tells Ahmad to grab his cigarettes. When Ahmad goes to do it, the grandfather reveals to his friend that he already has his cigarettes:

<blockquote><i>— We want the kid to be brought up properly. When I was a kid, my dad would give me a penny every week and a beating every other week. He might sometimes forget my pocket money, but he'd never forget to give me a beating.
— What if he doesn't obey, even after a beating?
— In society, a child must have discipline and learn to do what his father says the first time… If he grows up lazy, he's of no use to society.
— But tell me this: Suppose the kid did nothing wrong. What would you do?
— I'd find an excuse to give him a beating every other week.</i></blockquote>

The difference between Abbas Kiarostami and Kafka is that Abbas Kiarostami does not conclude that one must give up. Instead, one continues asking for an answer, until the question with an answer arrives.

The movie sometimes cuts sets into flat surfaces reminiscent of side-scrolling video games. Ahmad moves through the house, upstairs, into various rooms. Every movement requires an additional sub-movement or a berating for doing it wrong. When he runs through the countryside, a hill will have a zig-zag path that he will follow upward.

I love this movie so much. I felt it all — I want to watch it again as soon as possible.

Trelkovsky looks at a new apartment. The previous tenant, Simone, threw herself out of the window and in critical condition.

Before taking it, Trelkovsky goes to visit Simone in the hospital. There, he meets Stella, a friend of Simone's. He lies about being Simone's friend, so Stella confides in him. After feeling up Stella at the movie theater, he calls the hospital to learn that Simone is dead.

He takes the apartment. His loud friends and total disregard for the other tenants leave him paranoid that the building is out to get him. But he's just an asshole who sees himself as a victim.

Kirk Smith stands shirtless in front of a statue of Jesus on the cross. He performs a ritual before going out and stalking a nurse. He strangles her and performs some unseen sexual abuse.

The radio announces a serial killer and rapist. Dr. Lindsay Gale is a radio psychologist. Kirk regularly listens to her and calls in with a stereotypical Spanish accent. He tracks down one of the callers, tying her up and performing a bizarre religious ritual.

Two detectives, Hatcher and McCabe, work with the police to solve the murders. They know two things: their killer is a Vietnam vet and a photographer.

This one isn't as violent as much of what you find on the Video Nasties list. It leans into more of a pulpy detective story than an outright slasher, leaving the more grotesque details to the imagination.

The story is familiar, but the murder scenes effectively made me squirm. The therapy scenes aren't any practice I'm aware of, but they increase the sense of vulnerability that makes the murder scenes icky.

The movie finds an excuse to get nearly every woman onscreen's top off. It's almost (almost) impressive.

No one's giving a stellar performance. The director's performance as the Lab Man is especially heinous. Nicholas Worth goes over the top as Kirk Smith.

The synth-heavy soundtrack is good. Like, really good! One-time composer, Byron Allred, gives us some tension and bops. I believe he's the same Byron Allred who played with Steve Miller Band and is on their song, Threshold. If I ever watched this movie again, it would be for the music, because I can find it anywhere.

The sun rises in a rural town in New Mexico. A yellow Continental pulls up in front of West Fidelity Bank. Two children swing on a swing set in front of the brick building. An older man, Charley, steps out of the passenger seat. He has a cheque in his hand. His foot is in a cast with a metal heel to support it. The driver, Nadine, waits in the car.

A police officer notices the Colorado plate on the yellow Continental. He's sure he's seen that plate number on a hot sheet. 

The teller must get the manager's approval before cashing it.

The officer returns to the bank. Nadine bites her lip, impatiently glancing at the bank door.

Charley argues with the manager, who will not cash an out-of-state cheque. He pulls a gun.

Two men with masks abruptly turn, guns in hand. One man pushes the bank security guard against the wall. The other hops over the counter, through the gated security window, wiping the surfaces with a rag to remove his fingerprints. He opens the cashier drawer with his handkerchief and unloads the money into a bag.

Charley, holding the manager at gunpoint, forces him to open the vault. ""You want to die for somebody else's money?""

The officer gets a callback on the radio about the plate — it belongs to a stolen green Camero. Each of the officers undoes the thumb breaks on their holsters. One officer steps out of the car and approaches the Continental. The other pulls perpendicular to the Continental to prevent it from driving off.

The driving officer sidles up to the Continental, tips his hat to Nadine, and asks her for her driver's license. She pretends to dig her bag, then shoots the officer in the head.

Chaos erupts as several people on both sides die. As the getaway car drives away, Charley pulls off his disguise — it's Walter Matthau! When the surviving robbers reach safety, the news reports a much lower amount stolen than the pull they brought in. They didn't just hit a bank — they uncovered a money-laundering scheme run by the Mafia. The cops want to catch their robbers. The Mafia wants their money back.

Everyone's got money on their mind, and no one is above suspicion.

<blockquote><i>— Charley, you worry too much.
— No such thing as worrying too much. Not when you got the fuzz and the Mafia after you at the same time.</i></blockquote>

Charley Varrick is intelligent — slow to act, quick to reason. He'll get you through unless you get in his way. Walter Matthau's naturalism is perfect for this type of role. Well, until they expect him to play sexy — his sense of humor should be enough.

This movie is a clockwork crime story — it ebbs and flows with such a logical progression. The film reveals details at the right time to keep the audience engaged. 

The stunts are stellar and economically use space to set up concrete obstacles. We get a little crop duster action, too.

The irony of Walter Matthau recommending a dentist to Andrew Robinson when his teeth look like they're about to rot out of his skull.

This is the first time I remember seeing Joe Don Baker where he doesn't look like a washed-up football player. His one character trait in this movie seems to be that he checks out butts.

Lalo Schifrin's score doesn't always work for me. He swings from harsh tension for insignificant scenes to breezy tennis club jazz seconds later. Now and again, the score matches the mood of the scene.

I don't know why I watched this before <i>Dirty Harry</i>. If it's anything like this movie, I'll watch it ASAP. Then again, I like Walter Matthau a lot more than Clint Eastwood.

Overall, this was way more fun than I was expecting!","cmc, cmc2024, heist",2024-03-13

Jonathan's parents were bonafide Satan worshipers. As a baby, his dad, eyes glowing green and whatnot, tried to kill him. His mother did her best to stop him, but could not. It took Wolfgang (Jack Nance!!), one of the acolytes, to rescue the baby.

But Wolfgang could not save Jonathan's mother. His father summoned something evil, which bursts from her chest.

After Jonathan's parents die, Jonathan inherits the house. He and his girlfriend, Rebecca, move in. Wolfgang stays as a caretaker, hoping that Jonathan will not follow in his father's footsteps. While looking through the basement, he finds his father's ritual garb, as well as a book full of rituals.

Rebecca throws a housewarming party, inviting their weirdo friends, including a guy named Mark who ""does a Toad Boy routine,"" whatever that means.

After most of the folks leave, the core friends look for something to do. Jonathan suggests doing a ritual. It looks like nothing happens, but when they go upstairs, a ghoulie manifests.

This is a wacky little thing. It's never quite funny when it means to be, but the absurdity kept me laughing throughout.

John Carl Buechler's ghoulies are pretty lame puppets. But they weren't supposed to be seen in such high definition, and they're slimy little weirdos, so I kind of like them.

<b>17th Century England</b>
His Majesty, King James II, lay in bed, surrounded by statues of saints and scholars. Barkilphedro, the king's jester, exits a secret passage behind one statue. He awakens the king to inform him they have captured Lord Clancharlie.

In excitement, the king jumps out of bed. They enter a room to find Lord Clancharlie in chains. Lord Clancharlie asks for his son, Gwynplaine. The jester pulls at the corners of his mouth to make a forced grin. The jester sold Gwynplaine to the Comprachicos, who carved Gwynplaine's face into a permanent grin.

The guards take Lord Clancharlie and force him into an iron maiden. The king banishes the Comprachicos from England. They flee, leaving young Gwynplaine in a snowstorm.

Gwynplaine wanders barefoot through the snowstorm. He finds a dead woman clinging to a baby, still living. He takes the baby into his arms.

They come to the door of Ursus, who takes them in. Ursus discovers the baby, named Dea, is blind. And that Gwynplaine has a permanent smile cut into his face.

As adults, Gwynplaine and Dea, along with Ursus and Homo the dog, travel the countryside, performing plays. Gwynplaine's fame as ""The Laughing Man"" pulls him into a life of unwanted scandal and despair.

I loved Paul Leni's <i>The Cat and the Canary</i> and need to see his film <i>Waxworks</i>. Paul Leni would make one more movie before dying of sepsis in 1929.

This movie's biggest claim to fame is Jack Pierce's design for Gwynplaine's permanent smile, the primary source for Joker's design in Batman.

Thankfully, the movie is more than that, with beautiful sets, exquisite costumes, dynamic cinematography, and dramatic lighting. The stage show has some great costumes, including a huge demon mask.

It's also a little sexy! In one scene, the filmmakers cleverly obscure the bathing Duchess with water ripples and framing.

Conrad Veidt's performance as Gwynplaine is emotional and contorted, similar to his performance in <i>The Hands of Orlac</i>. He has to go even bigger with a permanent smile, but it works.

The filmmakers based this on a Victor Hugo novel. It has that similar rambling, episodic quality, which is the only thing keeping more from outright loving this.

John has a heart attack. Louise digs through his jacket for the pills, but the pill case is empty. John laughs, telling Louise that if he dies, she gets nothing. She rows to shore, angry and desperate. But it's no use. John dies in the boat, his terrible rockabilly playing on the radio.

Louise drafts a letter as John inviting Louise to the family castle in Ireland, Castle Haloran. John's brothers, Billy and Richard, believe that the ghost of Kathleen haunts the castles. Kathleen was their sister, who died in a drowning accident years ago. Every year, the Halorans gather to remember Kathleen.

The script for this movie was a rush job. Coppola shot a film with Coreman, who had the extra budget. Coreman originally intended to make a quickie himself. But Coppola took a stab at a rough plot, and Coreman gave the movie to him.

Wouldn't it be great to see imaginative directors — Steven Spielberg, Joe Dante, John Landis, and George Miller — make their own Twilight Zone-themed shorts? Well, too bad — they're remaking old episodes you've already seen.

Richard Matheson is the actual star — his two segments are the good parts of the anthology. Everything else ranges from dull to abysmal.


<b>Prologue - John Landis **</b>
Midnight Special plays on the tape deck as Albert Brooks and Dan Aykroyd drive down the highway, singing along. Oh, Jesus, the cassette tape comes off the spool and spits out onto the dash. What will they do now? Bore the hell out of you for a few minutes.


<b>Back There/A Quality of Mercy Mash-Up - John Landis *</b>
Vic Morrow plays a racist bigot who goes back in time to hang with assorted racist groups. But for a ""rule of threes"" thing, he also fights for the Viet Cong. 

John Landis kills him and two illegally hired child actors — Renee Shin-Yi Chen and Myca Dinh Le — in a real-life helicopter accident that was, understandably, cut.

Steven Williams shows up to ask Morrow to shut up.


<b>Kick the Can Remake - Steven Spielberg **</b>
Scatman Crothers plays <a href=""https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalNegro"">a certain Magical trope</a>, allowing a retirement home of white people to relive childhoods and learn the true meaning of ""inner child.""

It's a lifeless script. Incredibly, it took three people to write the screenplay.


<b>It's a Good Life Remake - Joe Dante ***.5</b>
Richard Matheson's script takes the original concept and gives us Helen Foley as our audience surrogate to learn what is unusual about the town she's traveling through. It also fixes the unsatisfying ending.

This segment is legitimately unsettling. The house design and all the practical effects are so fun! Sally Cruikshank's animations are nightmare fuel.

What a stacked cast
* Kathleen Quinlan crushes it.
* Hey Dick Miller! This will be the sixth movie I've seen him in this year.
* This might be the first time I've seen Nancy Cartwright acting.
* Kevin McCarthy is appropriately unhinged.


<b>Nightmare at 20,000 Feet Remake - George Miller ***</b>
John Lithgow plays William Shatner's role as a guy who sees a Gremlin on the wing of his plane. Matheson adapts his short story a second time. I don't think he changes much of anything, letting the updated effects and unhinged Lithgow justify its existence. Also, George Miller's wacky cinematography helps.","hooptober, hooptober6.0, horror anthology, written by women, edited by women",2024-03-15

Rain pours on the gargoyles adorning the balustrade atop Notre Dame. The stained glass sings in rich color, hinting at the warmth within. Columns adorned with knights and dragons — down the camera tracks until we arrive at an unassuming maintenance hole cover.

Hands reach up from beneath the cover and throw it aside. A mustached man in a sullied trench coat pulls himself up and sets to running. His Oxfords gallop on the stone path as he calls for a taxi.

The taxi driver sees the man. The sewer grates erupt open, and something pulls him down.

Cut to Andy, Brad, and Chris aboard a train, drinking burgundy wine and tallying daredevil points from their European tour. Andy's in last place, so he must pull a remarkable stunt in Paris.

Cue Rock music with a distinct DJ scratch reminds us we're in the 90s, baby. They wait for the guards to abandon their post before ascending the Eiffel Tower. Andy plots his jump, but a woman named Serafine interrupts him. The boys go to hide as she tearfully climbs the banister. Andy tries to stop her from jumping, but she jumps. Thankfully, Andy's already in his bungee gear, so he leaps to her rescue.

She slips out of his grip just feet from the ground. She runs away, and Andy is in love. So, he plots a way to find her, taking him into a world he isn't ready to understand.

Cue ""Walking on the Sun"" by Smash Mouth.

The boys are like an Old Navy rendition of slackers. They have no redeeming qualities and do everything possible to ogle every woman they see.

The camera warbles about — it isn't sure what sort of movie we're in. It seems like horror, but we get slapstick comedy and vague romance troupes intermingled at random.

The physical comedy is forced and difficult to stand. Andy hits his head, drops hot coffee, and chews condoms.

The script is painful. ""Your sadness moved me. No one so beautiful should be so sad."" They dubbed Julie Deply in some scenes because the lines they had her say were a mouthful, even without a French accent.

Most of the werewolf effects are CGI. I don't mind mediocre CGI — it's disappointing that the sequel to one of the greatest werewolf transformation movies is so cheaply rendered.

I have a high tolerance for 90s movie mediocrity. But this goes above and beyond to create a grating experience. I'm truly stunned at how unbearable this is.","tubi, hooptober, hooptober6.0, werewolves, body horror",2024-03-16

</i><i>and his organization will sell it to the Iraqis within 24 hours. Your objective is to make sure the plutonium is returned safely to our base. </i></blockquote>
Jack, dressed in all black, walks through an empty warehouse. At the other end are stacked barrels and construction equipment. Jack pulls the plastic tarps off of the XRT and starts up a satellite tracker inside.

He bursts through the slide doors, crushing the six cars in the parking lot as the XRT bounces over them and rushes for the border. He breaks through military trucks, everything exploding at the slightest touch.

Tanks, motorcycles, and tankers all chase down the XRT. A train is coming down the train tracks. The XRT won't make it, so Jack pulls back and ollies the XRT over and through the train, escaping the military convoy.

We presume his job is complete, and Jack can retire.

But three years later, while living in the south of France with the pregnant Katheryn, Jack gets a visit from the old team. They need him for one more job. Stavros is back, and they want him alive. Jack can't truly retire until Stavros does.

But Jack won't be able to do it alone. He'll need the help of Yaz, an eccentric arms dealer — a kinky Q with all the spy gear and friendship he needs.

God, this cartoon action movie is so over-the-top. I was laughing through so much of this. It's all action cliches, saturated and mainlined. We also get some dopey sci-fi concepts.

Van Damme keeps his muscles out and oiled as much as possible, and god bless him.

The homoeroticism is not subtext — Van Damme is embracing his then-beloved status in the gay community. Unfortunately, he became virulently homophobic in more recent years.

Dennis Rodman has been an LGBTQ+ alley for years, so he leans into that undefined sexuality in his performance.

Mickey Rourke had started tanking his career by getting awful plastic surgery. He still looks somewhat like himself, but it's clear that the camera does not want to look at him for too long and confuse the audience.

I would compare this to <i>The Fifth Element</i> — both aren't good movies but make up for it in fun. Also, both films are ""for the gays.""

Somehow, Rodman made the best movie starring a Chicago Bull in the 90s.

Lou and Jackie meet at the gym and fall for each other. Lou gives Jackie some leftover steroids to help her in the competition. They fuck, and Jackie stays with Lou.

Jackie decides to take matters into her own hands.

The film has a sinister magic to it. The comedy and brutal violence come out of nowhere. Reality blurs as Jackie takes more steroids — it's unclear how much is her perspective and how much is the bizarre reality the movie establishes.

<blockquote><i>In the grim comedy of life, it has been wisely said that the last laugh is the best</i></blockquote>Paul Beaumont is a scientist working on a new theory on the origin of humanity. Paul and his wife, Marie, spent years struggling. Baron Regnard took interest in his work and invited Paul and Marie into his home.

One day, Paul completes the proof he needs to take his theory before the Academy. When Paul goes to sleep, his wife helps the Baron steal Paul's papers so that the Baron can present the ideas as his own.

When Paul and the Baron appear before the Academy, Paul tries to speak up for himself, but the Baron slaps Paul and calls him a mere assistant, which causes the Academy to laugh at Paul. Paul goes to Marie for consolation, but she reveals her affair with the Baron and calls Paul a clown.

Five years later, we see Paul has become a circus clown, going by ""HE, who gets slapped."" Though he performs a humiliating role, he believes he is moving on. That is until the Baron returns to his life.

The film captures the essence of comedy — that time can turn life's tragedies into something we can laugh at. But time can also make us its fool if we cannot escape its shadow.

Lon Chaney is heartbreaking. For the period, he gives a natural performance.

The film uses a clown spinning a globe as a transitional piece. The clown is horrifying. It's impossible to see any of the clowns in this movie as anything other than nightmares.

In 1987, Anna and Georg sit in the car as it runs through an automatic car wash. The camera sits in the backseat as the wash goes through its steps.

At 6 AM, the alarm goes off. Anna and Georg get up, put on their robes, and start their day. 

Brush teeth. Wake up their daughter, Eva. Tie Oxfords. Feed fish. Make coffee. Remind Georg to wear his red sweater. Pack up the briefcase. Eat breakfast. Drop off Eva at school. Drop off Anna at her workplace. Go to Georg's engineering job.

Anna writes to Georg's family to give an update on her family. Everyone is busy. Eva's health has improved after being in poor condition. Anna's mother died. Her brother, Alexander, took it quite hard.

Eva lies about being blind to Anna. Anna later finds a newspaper in Eva's room detailing how a family reconnected after a daughter became blind.

Alexander comes over for dinner. He cries. Anna cradles his head to console him. They watch TV together.

And so on. We revisit the family twice more, in 1988 and 1989.

Michael Haneke takes a news article he read and maps the imagined progression in a Chantel Aukerman-like banality, where the signals that something is wrong come from the dissolution of the family routine.

Like all of Haneke's work I've seen, the camera is a forced participant, reticent to watch but unable to leave.

Even with knowledge of their every waking moment, the film reminds us we still don't truly know this family. The reasons behind their actions remain unknown. The most we know are the consumer goods they've purchased.

The spaceship Argos catapults through space. Inside, figures in black leather cut with yellow observe technical tools that observe Aura, the planet below them. Despite the signal they are receiving, they cannot detect any life.

They prepare for a landing on the planet and relay to their sister ship, Galliot. But as they communicate with Galliot, they lose transmission from it and the planet's signal.

A gravitational force pulls them to the surface. Though it feels like they'll crash, the ship gently lands. Suddenly, two crew members attack the others. They can't figure out why they're doing it. The attackers eventually snap out of it, forgetting what they've done.

Galliot sends out a mayday. Their ship is across the way. They find two crew members who fought each other to death. When they come back to bury the bodies, the bodies have disappeared.

Whatever is happening to them, it is an intentional act. They must figure out what before it kills them all.

Bava brings his rich color palette and production design to a sci-fi concept. With a slashed budget, Bava had to pull off all the effects in camera. He also pulled props designed for <i>Hercules in the Haunted World</i> since they matched the space aesthetic. The deaths feel like some of Bava's giallo work.

The result is the most vibe-heavy, psychedelic space movie I've seen in recent memory. This is sci-fi chic.

Harleen Quinzel was once a child, believe it or not. Her father put her in St. Bernadette's, getting her out of his life. Following her college years and a few heartbreaks, she embarked on her journey as a psychiatrist at Arkham Asylum. There, she met Joker and fell into a toxic vat and toxic love. She took the moniker Harley Quinn, pulling several heists and stunts for Joker, who took credit for all her work. Finally, Joker had enough of her and kicked her to the curb.

She moved into a bachelor pad above Doc's Place Chinese Cuisine. Like many breakups, she looked for a new identity — cutting her hair, buying a pet hyena, and eating a whole tub of ice cream. You know, all the classic breakup cliches.

Once Harley makes her breakup with Joker public, her adversaries emerge seeking vengeance. 

Christina Hodson's script does the brilliant footwork of re-contextualizing Harley Quinn without ignoring the established mythos up to that point. She pulls Harley Quinn out of her codependent patterns and into an ensemble that better highlights her skills.

The stylistic flairs align with Suicide Squad but integrate more seamlessly with the movie's aesthetic.

Margot Robbie's role as producer made the film possible. As we've seen with <i>Batgirl</i>, DC has no qualms about throwing away movies.

The fight choreography is so tight. Every movement tells the story and locks into the soundtrack. 

Robbie's performance as Harley Quinn carries all the eccentricities that Arleen Sorkin brought to the <i>Batman</i> animated series while also developing a more nuanced and human character that other adaptations lacked.

Mary Elizabeth Winstead hasn't been this cool before. Although casting the Rocky Mount native as Sicilian is an odd choice.

I've only seen Jurnee Smollett in this and <i>Lovecraft Country</i>. While that show was disappointing, her performance was outstanding in it. She's badass in this.

Ewan McGregor is an odd choice for Roman Sionis. When Roman is in control, he emanates a carefree nonchalance — a villain unconcerned with his vile deeds. But when anything goes wrong, he throws a little boy temper tantrum.

I'm always happy to see Steven Williams, even in minor roles.

Similar to <i>Barbie</i>, the film maintains a diet ""fuck the patriarchy"" spirit that, on paper, should offend no one. The filmmakers, however, made the ""mistake"" of turning down the horny on Harley Quinn's costuming, upsetting all the comic nerds who wouldn't see a woman-led movie otherwise. Which is insane, but I digress. I imagine the backlash would have been worse had Cathy Yan had any say during the edit #releaseTheYanCut.

Why did they hire two identical actors? They should have let Costas Mandylor talk in his Australian accent. Then, we would have some way to differentiate them.

New York. The city of angels. Harold Gorman, sitting on a water tower, is out to make more angels as he opens fire on random pedestrians. Men, women, and children collapse, confusing and horrifying the surrounding people.

Peter Nicholas, a Catholic NYPD detective, takes the initiative and climbs the water tower to speak to the shooter. The news interviews Harold's mother, who doesn't believe her son is capable of this — from a moral standpoint, and the physical impossibility of the shots made.

Peter asks Harold why he's doing this:

<blockquote><i>— You promise you won't tell anyone else?
— I can't promise that, Harold. That's my job to find out.
— Well, I'll tell you, anyway. God told me to.</i></blockquote>Harold dives head first off the water tower, to his death.

The experience shakes Peter and his faith. As he investigates, similar patterns occur across the city. Stabbings, shootings, family murders — all done because the assailant claims Gold told them to. The result will bring shocking revelations about the person behind it and Peter himself.

While initially a police procedural, the film merges science fiction concepts. The results are jarring, but appropriately so. The flashback scenes, in particular, are wild as hell.

Tony Lo Bianco's Peter Nicholas is sincere but ashamed of his faith, hiding it from his girlfriend. His ex-wife (whom he won't divorce for moral reasons) pities his faith, as it doesn't seem to bring him joy. His performance blends the tough New York cop trope with a softer, more curious person who is afraid to show himself.

The film explores faith as a distancing object — how people use God to avoid letting people know them and get close to them. By defining yourself as a religious person, you create an unknowable person within you.

This film is the first great movie I've seen by Larry Cohen. He's always been unafraid to get weird, but this is the most successful execution I've seen.

Her parents were both arrested —  her mother, Ramona (Amanda Plummer), for prostitution and her stepfather, Larry, for drugs and child abuse. 

Mrs. Sheets, a social worker, tried to take Vanessa. But Vanessa cuffed her to the bed. So, in her red pleather jacket and with all she could carry in a basket, Vanessa escaped in her mother's car.

Vanessa is going to her grandmother's house in Stockton, hoping she will take Vanessa in. But before she goes, she's off to see her boyfriend, Chopper Wood (Bokeem Woodbine).

She better watch out, though. The I-5 Killer is murdering girls her age. So, when her car breaks down, should she trust Bob Wolverton (Kiefer Sutherland) when he comes to offer her help?

The movie interpolates Little Red Riding Hood to explore the variety of ways men prey on women. The wolf can be obvious, a person you intrinsically trust, or the system designed to prosecute them. No one can know if anyone in their life isn't a wolf.

Reese Witherspoon's characterization of Vanessa is sharp. She used her authentic Nashville accent. It doesn't make much sense in the LA setting, but it helps suggest in the audience's head that Vanessa is ""low-class.""

Sutherland's performance is perfect. I don't want to say too much.

Oliver Stone read Matthew Bright's script and helped get it made. As a result, the cast has several noteworthy character actors giving stellar performances. Stone didn't want to direct the movie, insisting Bright should direct his script.

Danny Elfman did the score in exchange for yard work. Elfman and Bright were childhood friends. The score fucking rules.

The movie had to make several cuts, mostly dialogue, to get an R rating. The MPAA also had problems with the ""tone"" of the film. Even after the R rating, the film received further censorship. Now, not even Shudder can access the original.

The movie has several prolonged sequences of characterization dialogue. They help establish the relationship between Vanessa and Bob while suggesting the true nature of his interactions with her. The scenes fluctuate between hilarious and disturbing.

There's also a fair bit of racist dialogue that is uncomfortable in the wrong way. Bright wrote this from his upbringing, for better or worse.

Mary (Katharine Isabelle) runs a scalpel across turkey skin, creating wounds to suture for practice. Mary is a surgical student who loves her field and excels at it. Student loan services call her repeatedly. She's behind on her phone service fees. She owes money that she doesn't have. So, she applies to work at a strip club.

During her interview with Billy, during which she reveals that she's a surgical student, word reaches him that someone cut up Rat. Billy offers her $5K in cash for an emergency surgery, no questions asked. Though she agrees, the experience leaves her terrified that, by helping, she has invited danger into her life.

A woman named Beatress shows up at Mary's place. Beatress received twelve surgical procedures to resemble Betty Boop. Her friend, Ruby, wants to transform into a human doll, but no one will perform the surgery. Beatress offers Mary substantial cash for performing the body modification surgery.

Mary becomes fascinated by extreme body modification, putting it into practice in unexpected ways.

If you are familiar with the body modification world, it won't surprise you that this movie is exceptionally gory. That said, it's not as overt as you might expect. The film also has a black sense of humor — par for the course with anyone in the medical field.

The movie's ethics are intentionally vague. For example, one character believes that, so long as they don't fuck up as a surgeon, that gives them carte blanche for the rest of their life. This includes drugging and raping someone.

Katharine Isabelle nails the role and meets the contradicting moods with grace.

The closest film I can compare it to would be <i>May</i>. <i>May</i>, however, cares about the lead's inner life and personality. So, when May does horrifying things, we understand why. Here, Mary remains an enigma.

The bassist from Spandau Ballet (Martin Kemp) makes out with his virgin princess girlfriend (Rebecca Ferratti). She leaves, and he falls asleep next to a beautiful waterfall — we've all been there, folks.

While he rests, three semi-nude women emerge from the woods. One puts an ankh necklace on him, which glows a 90s television blue. Another bares her fangs and draws blood from his neck.

Centuries pass. The guy, now a vampire, feels his virgin princess girlfriend's soul at a small college in an unnamed town. But the clock is ticking! The vampire will fall into an eternal sleep in three days. Her virgin princess soul is the only thing that will save him.

Charlotte (Alyssa Milano) is also a virgin, not a princess, but a girlfriend to a boy named Chris (Harold Pruett). The vampire will sew doubt in Charlotte's mind by giving her horny dreams about sex that Chris could never pull off. Once Charlotte falls out of love with her boyfriend, the vampire will make his move.

Can Charlotte choose between a horny boy and a horny centuries-old vampire? Or will she find her own path?

Film nerds may know director Anne Goursaud from her editing work with Francis Ford Coppola. As a director, she only directed direct-to-video erotica like this.

Alyssa Milano felt protected working with a woman director and taught her how to define nudity clauses in her contracts. It's worth teasing out these nuances when contemporary discourse is ""boobs = male gaze.""

That said, this isn't high art. It's like a Harlequin Romance. Charlotte has little consent throughout the movie. Chris spies on her changing, the vampire manipulates her in her sleep, and the photographer makes a move on her.

The score is by Joseph Williams, the lead singer of Toto and son of Barbara Ruick and John Williams. It sounds like every low-budget horror movie from the 90s. I need to find out if he's scored any Charles Band movies.

As erotica, this is tame but evocative. As a movie, it's a little silly. However, it's not a complete disaster.","tubi, hooptober, hooptober6.0, vampires, written by women, directed by women, edited by women, queer",2024-03-22

The centuries-old convent holds its share of secrets. So when the resident doctor determines that Cecilia has miraculously conceived a child, Cecilia cannot help but wonder if there is more to the story.

The film explores bodily autonomy in the context of the Catholic church and nunnery. Does giving yourself to God include the consent for God to impregnate you? When you are at the mercy of men, how do you differentiate between the work of God or the devil in disguise?

The film does not go as deeply into these ideas as the movie first suggests. Sidney Sweeney's starring role adds a meta-layer to the conversation of consent, as men on the internet lay claim to her body and likeness, just as they do with all women who do nude roles.

The movie looks gorgeous. The sets are lush with texture, and the costumes are adorned with detail. The gore is shocking and, frankly, too graphic for the story — the film rivals Ari Aster in its fixation on head/face trauma. Similarly, the movie relies on jump scares for scenes where the tension is sufficient without it.

The score isn't surprising, full of hymn references and booming textures. A montage segment makes the Italian nunsploitation homage text as Will Bates's score takes on Sergio Leone-esque textures reminiscent of his scores for exploitation films from the 70s.

Jesus Franco, under the pseudonym AM Frank, made two versions of this movie with two different casts — one with French actors for Marius Lesoeur and one with Spanish actors for himself. The Spanish version is a lost film.

The film feels hurried — the camera doesn't bother to set up multiple shots, tracking and zooming to the camera's limits.

Conceptually, however, the movie has some interesting ideas. Desert zombies are under-represented, usually going into mummy movies instead.

Also, the filmmakers shot on location. It may be uninspired location footage, but it beats the alternative. Plus, Franco finds the most unmotivated reasons for nudity to date.

Julio Torres has a hyper-specific sense of humor. It either lands with you or doesn't. A feature-length collection of his humor begs only to be loved or tolerated. If you've watched<i> Los Espookys</i> or <i>My Favorite Shapes</i>, you understand.

What those shows won't prepare you for is Tilda Swinton's character, Elizabeth. Elizabeth occupies the vast majority of the movie's runtime. If you've worked in customer service, I don't know how you can find her anything but triggering. Her monologues run in endless, repetitive circles. In the film, Alejandro is the only person who can tolerate them. If we include the audience, he may still be the only one, or at least one out of a select few.

Torres understands earnest surrealism the way Michel Gondry once did. When Gondry wrote and directed, he underserved the magical ideas that made them charming. Torres fills his movie with a similar magic that characters consistently undercut.

Lisa, the artist supervising the restoration, discovers beneath a fresco an encrypted document. She shows the document to Evan, and the two work to understand it and uncover the secrets buried beneath the church.

The movie is fully aware of the link between the Teutonic Order and the Nazis. For example, they modeled the SS iron cross after the Order's insignia.

Evan's desires are similar to Hitler's in that he's fixated on the idea of a sacred relic that makes him more powerful. I have no idea why these are a church librarian's ambitions, but whatever.

<blockquote><i>I'll see you tomorrow, God willing</i></blockquote>Jacobo and Marta are two single and deeply lonely people. Each has their daily routine. Marta works as the head supervisor of Jacobo's sock factory. She also takes care of the minutiae of Jacobo's life, such as helping schedule the Mazeva service for Jacobo's mother, who died a year before.

Jacobo sends a fax about the service to his brother, Herman, in Brazil. Jacobo asks Marta to pretend to be his wife while Herman is in town. Marta agrees to assist without compensation.

Their routine continues day after day as they prepare for Herman's visit. They clean Jacobo's apartment, which has been in shambles since his mother passed. They have pictures together — everything to give the facade of a happy marriage.

Neither Jacobo nor Marta have much in common. They both find it hard to open up to one another. But as Herman stays with them, his outgoing personality allows Marta to discover a part of herself she thought lay dormant. Meanwhile, Jacobo remains resentful of his brother, who got to live life while Jacobo took care of their mother.

I'm not sure what the comedic component of the movie is. ""Pretending to be married"" has farce written all over it. The execution is anything but. It also tries to draw humor out of Jacobo being Jewish and frugal — fucking depressing.

The performances suit the characters perfectly. Marta is the one who kept me invested in the movie.

Jacobo rejects joy and change in his life. The film shows no sympathy towards him, almost suggesting, ""If only he were Herman.""

We got some mild chuckles but turned it off after a few minutes. 

This movie became an Allan Smithee project because Larry Cohen's script had a black lead, and the investors didn't want that. Cohen wouldn't rewrite without compensation, and the producers refused. The producers hired Robert Davi for the role, so Lustig cut the material that made no sense with a white lead, leaving him with under an hour's worth of the movie. Lustig left when production forced them to shoot filler to hit an 85-minute runtime.

Of course, all this is word-of-mouth, but it's still interesting. Also, it explains the absurd amount of B-roll of Maniac Cop walking around menacingly spinning his baton.

Robert Forster showing up was a delightful surprise. He's on screen for, like, six minutes, and I loved every second.

Lustig's a good director, and there is an entertaining movie buried in here.

Frank Bannister is a Psychic Investigator. He's also a fraud, but not in the way you expect. Frank can communicate with the dead but doesn't exorcise ghosts from houses. Instead, he has a cadre of ghosts that he hires to pretend to haunt a house so he can exorcise it for a fee.

Dr. Lucy Lynskey and her husband, Ray, are the latest of Frank's targets because Frank drove over their fence and didn't want to pay for it. But after Frank does his song-and-dance, he sees mysterious numbers on Ray's head.

Soon, Ray is dead. Frank keeps seeing numbers on people's foreheads, each higher than the last. Afterward, the person dies. The trouble is that people keep spotting Frank with the recently deceased. They suspect him to be the killer.

The film uses a LOT of CGI. For the cartoonish effects, however, it makes sense.

I liked this movie until the ghosts showed up. They're so lame, and they talk a lot. The movie consistently stops in its tracks for a ghost to show off a ghost effect.

Michael J. Fox's character is so mean-spirited. I get it — he's washed up and depressed because of his wife, but give us something to root for!

The script is also gross. There's a scene where a ghost tries to fuck a mummy. ""I like it when they lie still like that.""

I was happy to see Jeffrey Combs being a big old weirdo. This is the closest I've seen him act like Jim Carrey.

The movie's gimmick is that every frame is a painting. At times, the scenes are breathtaking. At others, it looks like the live-action sequences from <i>Myst</i>.

This awkward style is the cost of filming footage and then painting the footage frame-by-frame. Also, the filmmakers did not have faith in the process, so they embedded highly detailed person renderings in abstract settings, further causing the 90s point-and-click aesthetic.

In art school, I had teachers who would talk about letting a medium be itself. This sentiment was primarily in response to the amount of painting from photographs and not deviating from them. If you're painting a photo, why not make the photo the art piece?

Here, with how much detail they render — including, unfortunately, cheap studio lighting — it makes me wonder why the gimmick at all.

The story is a horror show, and it has nothing to say other than, ""That's people for you."" Why the filmmakers would dedicate five years to this story is beyond me. From a time and setting perspective, I get it — evoking the paintings of peasants from the era (and referencing them) speaks to an artistic history. But why this story?

In case the description is unclear, this movie is silly as hell. Life is miserable, so let's make folks laugh.

This film came after Moore's success as Dolemite, establishing his reputation as a poet of the streets. His Petey Wheatstraw character isn't too different, especially when he comes back from the dead.

Then, the tape in the tape deck unspools. A frat member fumbles with the deck as Keith and AJ remove the nooses from their necks. Instead of the theatrics, they offer to get entertainment for the party the frat is throwing.

By ""entertainment,"" they mean a stripper. They borrow a car from rich kid Duncan and find a classy joint called The After Hours Club in the newspaper. When they get there, it isn't quite what they expect. The place is alright, but the strippers are vampires.

Before F<i>rom Dusk til Dawn</i>, there was <i>Vamp</i>. Sure, this doesn't have Salma Hayek. But it does have Grace Jones in Keith Haring body paint, dancing to an original song of hers called ""Surrender Seduction"" on a sculpture modeled after Dolph Lundgren, Grace Jones's boyfriend at the time. Whenever Grace Jones performed at The Paradise Garage, Keith Haring would always do her body paint.

Richard Wenk wrote the script for this movie in a weekend to a spec of ""college students, strippers, and vampires"" for Donald Borchers. Borchers made the poster first and wanted a movie that matched it.

The color is so my deal. Lilac and turquoise mood lights cover the city. Grace Jones wears aquamarine contact lenses.

Gedde Watanabe was in an '80s movie where he didn't have to put on an offensive accent. He still has to be a friendless nerd, and his jokes aren't good, unfortunately.

There's some ""one wacky night"" a la <i>After Hours</i> zaniness — they even say, ""one wacky night"" — but it's nowhere near as entertaining or motivated. The movie ends over and over again.

Mario spins around his house, disheveled but joyous. He tells a portrait of his deceased wife, Patricia, that they're getting out — that he's sold the bingo hall. He goes to the dining room, pulls open a steaming tray, and begins gorging himself. They're bingo balls. He keeps eating until he chokes to death.

The elder residents of Oak Springs are reeling from the changes to their neighborhood — houses for sale, businesses closing. Meanwhile, hipster coffee shops and microbreweries are opening.

Lupita (Adriana Barraza) is a regular at the bingo hall and is friends with Mario. When the place goes under new management and becomes a casino, she and fellow bingo heads, Dolores (L. Scott Caldwell) and Yolanda (Bertila Damas), look into it.

People are winning big left and right — and dying a bizarre death soon after.

The film is unsubtle in its exploration of gentrification. That shiny coffee shop is nice and may give the community a sense of progress. But its presence hikes the cost of living for the older residents, leaving many of them homeless or dead.

As businesses move in, they may offer a reasonable price for residents' property or land, but the upheaval can be unbearable for the more precarious residents.

The movie overstates the message with Mr. Big (Richard Brake), the casino owner, who calls people losers if they don't win big. He feeds off of their desperation — a true embodiment of evil. With satire this overt, there's little to dig into, so we spend most of the movie watching the premise reach its logical conclusions.

Still, it's easy to root for a movie about community solidarity and the human cost of capitalism.

Adriana Barraza and L. Scott Caldwell have so much fun with the roles. They rarely get roles that allow them the opportunity. I don't watch any of the shows L. Scott Caldwell is on, so it's nice to see her since <i>Lost</i>.

The deaths are the movie's strong suit — they're gross and made me cringe several times.

Takuyoshi Masuoka is a freelance cameraman who carries his camera everywhere.

For work, he captures footage of a man shoving a knife into his eye to commit suicide. Like Masuoka, the man was a freelance agent with no affiliations.

The experience drives Masuoka to explore fear and the unexplained. He's determined to film that fear at any cost. His research takes him underground.

The film explores the distancing effect of the camera and how it can make even actual footage feel fake or staged. This movie came out when shock sites like goatse and rotten.com were sharing gore and murder videos that kids my age were watching.

The film also incorporates H. P. Lovecraft's fixations of the unreliable narrator and horror so incomprehensible that it drives the witness insane. Can the camera operator capture the horror without being affected? Is he willing to risk it?

The handheld camera footage has interlacing artifacts that help distinguish it from the film's digital footage. It also further enforces the unreality of the experience.

Unfortunately, once the movie ventures underground, the terror dissipates considerably.

<b>From the distribution company that brought you <i>My Dinner With Andre</i> comes a film of a decidedly different tone.</b>

<blockquote><i>This film has been edited from the 25 hours of footage found at the ""Be My Cat"" crime scene in Rădăuți, Romania, on May 20, 2014</i></blockquote>Adrian is an aspiring filmmaker. He has written a film called <i>Be My Cat</i> in which he sought the perfect star. When he saw Anne Hathaway play Catwoman in <i>The Dark Knight Rises</i>, he knew she was perfect for the role.

This film showcases Adrian's filmmaking style, assembled to convince Anne Hathaway to come to Romania and star in the movie. He invites three local actresses to shoot demo scenes.

The film Adrian is making seems to be about a creep named Adrian, an aspiring filmmaker obsessed with Anne Hathaway.


<b>*** SPOILERS ***</b>

Adrian Țofei went method for this movie, committing himself to being this character for five years.

Țofei followed Ion Cojar's method, which attempts to create performances that feel like authentic experiences to the degree that the audience should not be able to tell it is a performance.

He performed all the filmmaking roles, including filming himself, despite having no experience with a camera.

Despite filming the first in-person meetings with the actresses, they corresponded for months prior. They established boundaries and prepared the roles so that they could improvise throughout.

These boundaries included using the spoken language to allow the actors a safe out — if they speak in English, they're in character — if in Romanian, they are themselves (with some exceptions).

The intro statement is correct — Țofei captured 25 hours of footage, 10 in guerilla style, and then edited the movie down from the footage.

Like <i>The Blair Witch Project</i>, this is a film that people have and will continue to repeat. Once the audience is in on it, the mystique is gone. But the quality of this filmmaking stands.

I don't think this film is as successful as <i>The Blair Witch Project</i> because no matter how meta it gets, we know it's a film. No one can recreate that deception.","tubi, cmc, cmc2016, found footage, troma",2024-03-29

So starts the poem that Walter Paisley (Dick Miller) overhears during his busboy shift at The Yellow Door coffeehouse. He claims to be an artist to the patrons, quoting lines from the poem, but he has no artistic inclinations.

Inspired by the poem, Walter goes home to make a sculpture of Carla (Barboura Morris), the hostess. He stops when he hears Frankie, the neighbor's cat, in the wall. He uses a knife to free it but accidentally kills the cat instead.

In a moment of panic/inspiration — same thing, really — he covers the cat in clay and passes it off as a sculpture, knife, and all.

People around him, however, suspect he's up to something. What starts as unfortunate accidents turns into something darker.

Charles B. Griffith wrote this Beat Generation satire for Roger Corman, who found the Beatniks fascinating. Griffith's script captures one of the most authentic portraits of the Beatniks in the 50s.

Dick Miller is so good as the fool who thinks he is king. This role was so iconic that several directors have used the name Walter Paisley in other films for roles Dick Miller played.

A meteor shower flies across the sky. George Gardner and his son David lay out in the yard, stargazing. Helen comes out to put David to bed. David talks of becoming an astronaut when he grows up, and his father eagerly encourages it.

Later that night, a thunderstorm wakes David. He goes to the window. Up on the hill, he sees dancing lights. A strange object gently descends from the sky and lands just beyond view.

David tells his parents. They suggest ball lightning or a ship from the nearby military base where George works. But David knows better, so his father agrees to check it out in the morning.

While David prepares for school, George returns from checking the landing site. He is still in his night robe and missing a slipper. David also notices an unexplained mark on the back of George's neck. George offers to show David what he saw over the hill, but his behavior concerns David.

Soon, David notices more people exhibiting similar behavior and the mark on the neck.

The movie follows the original script closely, leaning on updated effects and profanity to differentiate it from the 1953 version. The alien stuff starts standard, but it gets wacky once we see inside the alien ship (compliment).

This movie wouldn't exist if not for Wade Williams buying the rights for the original and funding this remake. It has no reason to exist beyond a millionaire's whims. The filmmakers still tried to make this entertaining.

The film is most fun when the possessed eat weird shit. Helen grabs a handful of raw beef, douses it in salt, and shoves it in her mouth. Mrs. McKeltch, the science teacher, swallows a frog.

The kid is watching <i>Lifeforce</i> on the TV at one point. I can't imagine his parents being okay with him watching the movie.

Marie is a French vampire living in Pittsburg. She only sucks the blood of criminals. She reads about some mafia wars in the streets and chooses the mafia as her prey.

At first, they're easy enough — drain their blood, then make it look like a mafia hit. But when the boss catches her off-guard and tries to rape her, she only drains his blood. As a result, he becomes a vampire.

Can Marie fix her mistake before he turns the entire mafia into a gang of vampires?

Between <i>Oscar</i> and <i>Beverly Hills Cop III</i>, John Landis wanted to make a movie about mobster vampires. Warner Bros said, ""No. Here's another vampire script."" So, he rewrote the script to make it about mobster vampires. He described the movie as ""a Hammer movie directed by Scorsese."" 😬

A core tenet of genre mashups is that you must write a story arc for each genre you're touching. Otherwise, the story feels incomplete — why genre blends are longer. This movie avoids that problem by only doing setup and never doing payoff.

Another cardinal rule is you don't show a better movie in your crappy movie. Landis shows people watching several classic horror movies throughout.

Landis wrote Marie as a sex object, but Anne Parillaud is a better actor than Landis expected and created a nuanced character — not a stellar character, but more than what's on paper.

That doesn't stop the movie from designing every shot to be as leering as possible. Even after Landis removed 20 minutes of ""sexual content,"" Parillaud is consistently nude, dropping her panties or showering. Creeps (including the love interest) try to sneak a peak.

I know I'm in the minority here — many horror fans love this movie. I needed something to make up the difference for what the experience lacks — gonzo gore, car chases, anything. This movie lacks most of what makes one watchable.","hooptober, hooptober6.0, vampires",2024-03-30

Nakulan and Ganga come to visit. They plan to stay at Madampalli for a few months. Thambi, Nakulan's uncle, warns him that a murdered woman haunts the place. Nakulan dismisses them as local superstition.

Ganga and Alli look for a room to store Ganga's books. They find a room locked with sacred threads. Thambi informs them that the room is restricted as it holds the spirits of people who died in the house. The spirits have murderous intentions.

Ganga doesn't believe the stories and thinks there are valuables in the room, so Alli forges a new key so she can open it. Sridevi tries to stop her, but it's too late — Ganga enters. Soon after, strange circumstances afflict the family

When they enter the forbidden room, the murdered woman sings songs that no one seems to hear. Characters also break out into songs every once in a while to recap or exposit.

The movie spends most of its time following Dr. Sunny, who believes Sridevi has a mental disability and should be locked up. He investigates the happenings in the house.

At its core, the movie feels like a psychological thriller, but it has romance, musical, horror, and comedy elements as well.

The movie's concept of mental illness is bizarre, but it's interesting to watch the film appeal to psychological solutions over supernatural ones.

The movie climaxes with a song and dance routine that includes convincing someone they're murdering another person.

The cops knock on Jacqueline’s door. She and her friends run out past them. The cops shoot. One friend takes a bullet wound and falls behind. Another jumps a fence. The cops trap Jacqueline in an alley and arrest her.

Because Jacqueline won’t reveal her partners, the judge sentences her to a minimum stint of 10 years in prison. She does her time at a women’s prison just outside of Connerville.

Roberta, a prisoner, has a dream about a guy feeling her up through the prison bars while she stabs at him with a cartoonishly large kitchen knife. The movie has several of these dream sequences from different perspectives.

Since this is a women-in-prison film, we need a sadistic warden for prisoners to rebel against. Here, we get the inimitable Barbara Steele as Superintendent McQueen. In her dream, she performs vaudeville for prisoners and receives a standing ovation.

But the actual villain is the prison doctor, who sedates the women and does reprehensible shit. Don't worry — he gets his comeuppance.

Director Jonathan Demme came through the Roger Corman machine, producing a few films for Corman. Corman had produced several women-in-prison films but wanted a fresh angle on it.

Corman gave the project to Demme as his first directorial project, with the stipulation that his movie keeps the violence and nudity that makes women-in-prison films sell.

Some scenes are playfully exaggerated, hinting at satire or genre play. For example, a prisoner seems to pleasure herself, but it turns out she’s about to roll some dice.

However, Demme’s inexperience may explain the unusual elements rather than any deliberate commentary. I’m a bit of a dipshit — you could convince me either way.

In an Icelandic snowstorm, a growling breath and heavy step follows a herd of horses. Whatever it is scares the horses as they run into the barn.

From the barn window, an Elkhorn sheep gazes. Others huddle together, watching the door as the heavy steps open it. One sheep wearily steps away from the others and collapses on the ground.

The farmers, María (Noomi Rapace) and her husband, Ingvar (Hilmir Snær Guðnason), stand near the window, listening to Christmas hymns on Radio Reykjavík. Just outside the window, the heavy breath pulses.

Time passes, and the snow melts. Ingvar and their border collie (Panda) go to the barn to sweep and feed the sheep. Later, María comes out to help Ingvar deliver the babies for the pregnant sheep.

One sheep gives birth, but her lamb has some unusual qualities. María and Ingvar care for it and name the lamb Ada.

The movie has a gentle pace — it captures how time moves on a remote farm. It's also a recurring quality of contemporary folk horror that some folks hate. I'm a fan of it.

The photography is gorgeous. Serene and haunted, the landscape is a perfect breeding ground for folklore.

I was nervous about the brother showing up. In one sense, he adds a much-needed dynamic. On the other, parts of his subplot muddle the story.

Noomi Rapace grew up on a farm with sheep and dogs. In this movie, she has to do some uncomfortable tasks, like clipping a newborn's ear and tagging it. It would be challenging to train a new actor on those tasks.

The sheep are so cute! The babies are so small! For Ada, the filmmakers combined an actual lamb, CGI, and practical effects. The result works surprisingly well, with only a few uncanny valley moments.

Panda, the border collie, has the sweetest eyes! She was so gentle with and concerned for the sheep — I cried.

The movie opens with Super 8mm footage of four people hanging from a tree.

Ellison, father and true crime writer, moves his family to write about the event. He hasn't told them that he moved them into the house where the murders happened.

The police show up and ask them to move and not write the story. They bring up another book Ellison wrote that accidentally helped a killer go free — they don't want the same for their small town.

In the attic, Ellison finds a projector and Super 8 reels. He watches one of the previous residents — it starts as typical family stuff but ends with their murder. Each reel has a different family, and each one ends with that family's murder in some creative way.

You'd think after finding what appears to be a serial killer's home movies, you'd move your family out. But Ellison is desperate for fame and money.

The movie starts off promising enough. But similar t<i>o Black Phone</i>, it gets wacky so fast that it's hard to stay invested. Still, I read Stephen King growing up (and clearly, so did the writer), so I can swallow some silly if it can find its way back to creepy.

Thematically, the movie explores the connection between the images we consume and how they affect us. We like to believe that what we consume doesn't affect who we are or what we do. I'm not saying that movies make us killers — but those images don't go away when we're not looking.

I didn't love this, and most of it felt formulaic. Some distinct images in the movie worked for me. I just wanted less supernatural stuff.

Everyone on-screen works well together! David Proval and Harvey Keitel feel like they've been friends since childhood. They enjoy movies and laugh at jokes together. It's that brotherly friendship that has homoerotic undertones because men can't have a physical relationship in our culture.

This movie wasn't Scorsese's first, but it's the one that has so many of his stylistic flourishes — the retro pop score, the slow-motion tracking shots, the gangster who trusts the wrong person and pays for it, and so on.

I prefer this story's indie, low-budget style over the glossy look of his later films. Scorsese would tackle several other genres, but something always pulls him back to the mobsters.

I'm amused by these live-action Japanese movies that would function better as an anime but aren't for whatever reason.

The movie looks cheap, but it doesn't harm the story. That's because this story is edgy, teen boy junk that wouldn't be exciting to me, anime or otherwise.

Still, the aesthetic is striking, so it's hard to get bored. You'll see plenty of creative and budget-friendly solutions to gore and viscera throughout. There is... so much blood.

The cinematography and color choices are also effective at selling the movie.

So, while not my bag from a narrative standpoint, the visuals are fun (and, surprise, gory).","tubi, hooptober, hooptober5.0, j-horror, body horror, cyberpunk",2024-04-02

He played during the Bossa Nova wave, and his disappearance became a metaphor for Bossa Nova as a whole — a brilliant movement ended too soon by South American dictatorships.

The movie uses a fictional framing narrative in which fictional author Jeff Harris (voiced by Jeff Goldblum) researches Tenório's disappearance and interviews actual Bossa Nova and Brazilian musicians. The film is animated to help meld the pieces together. Its style is flat and bright and has prominent South American vibes.

The movie lacks any real narrative thrust, jumping from interview to interview with scant story beats to tie them together. As a result, the pacing is abysmal, and the interviews become redundant recollections of how funny and pure Tenório was.

It's a shame because the details of what happened are fascinating. I still like the movie, but in more competent hands, this could have been something great.","amc southpoint, owen",2024-04-03

Woody and Crazy bootleg VCDs. They sell them their stall in New Trend Plaza Mall. They spend most of their time not selling their wares, instead causing trouble and stealing from other stores in the mall.

Meanwhile, government agents and black market dealers meet in the warehouse district. The dealers have a soft drink capable of turning people into zombies. They showcase its capabilities by showing off a zombie who drank some. The zombie breaks free and kills two agents.

One agent escapes with the soft drink. Woody and Crazy accidentally hit the agent with their car. The agent, barely able to move, crawls for the soda. Woody thinks the agent is thirsty, so he grabs the soda and pours it into the agent's mouth.

They bring the agent back to the mall but get distracted and play video games. When they remember the guy in their trunk, they return but find the agent missing.

You see where this is going.

The movie has the slacker hangout feel of <i>Mallrats</i> blended with the goofy horror of Charles Band or Peter Jackson. And, of course, being a zombie mall movie, it riffs on <i>Dawn of the Dead</i>.

Still, the film holds a distinct HK aesthetic, whether an accurate portrayal of 1998 or how the movie industry understood it.

The film sets up the two leads as irredeemable assholes who will exploit anyone and trust no one but uses the zombie circumstances to force them into trusting others to survive. It's not brilliant, but it's worth knowing because they are intolerable for much of the movie.

While not a great movie, it keeps up the energy and doesn't overstay its welcome. It warrants a lot of comparisons but ends up being unlike any zombie movie I've seen.

<blockquote><i>Are you talking to me? I don't understand what you're saying, but it sounds wonderful.</i></blockquote>
In 1986, Professor Paris Catalano (Christopher Plummer) travels to Venice to follow Nosferatu (Klaus Kinski). Records mention seeing him at Carnival in 1786, during the plague.

The fact this movie functions at all is shocking. Kinski did everything possible to make everyone in the crew miserable. It went through several directors' hands, most leaving because of Kinski. 

Augusto Caminito directed, and Luigi Cozzi helped as the second unit director.

After six weeks, Caminito couldn't take it anymore and finished the movie despite not filming large swaths of the script.

What helps this movie work is the diet Gothic mood. What kills it is Kinski's refusal to look or act like Nosferatu. Instead, he's just some horny dude who hangs out and fucks.

Overall, it's an incomplete movie — characters die and appear at random, and nothing ties together. I can get down with vibes. But it's hard to vibe when you're still figuring out what's happening.","shudder, hooptober, hooptober5.0, vampires, italian gothic",2024-04-04

Corky (Anthony Hopkins) wakes his ailing mentor, Merlin, to tell him about his first magic show. Corky tells Merlin that the show went flawlessly while he gives Merlin his medicine.

Through flashback, we see the club where he performed — an open mic night full of Bob Dylans and Dolly Partons. Corky gets on stage with his deck of cards to a scattered and disinterested crowd. He breaks and screams at the crowd for not paying attention.

Merlin sees through the lie. He tells Corky that he needs to find the charm. If he can do that, he’ll find success.

<blockquote><i>They don’t care from heart, kid. They just want to be entertained.</i></blockquote>

One year later, Corky performs a sold-out show at the same club. This time, he does the trick again. A voice interrupts from the crowd, claiming to do it better.

Corky enters the audience to grab Fats, a sailor-mouthed ventriloquist dummy with a mind of its own. Corky tries to continue his magic, but Fats makes sex jokes and keeps the audience laughing. The thing is, Corky cannot control Fats, even off-stage.

Despite the premise, the film avoids (some) “Devil Doll” tropes. Corky has his issues that the movie uses the premise to dive into.

The film layers flashbacks into present-day scenes as Corky reflects on his upbringing and the one who got away, Peggy Ann Snow (Ann-Margret).

<blockquote><i>I’m not talking about puppy love — I’m talking about salvation.</i></blockquote>

Anthony Hopkins has that shy cuteness of an incel. He stresses me out so much. He pressures himself to avoid failure.

Ann-Margret is perfect as the doting, exuberant woman that an incel wishes he had. But she’s married to a guy with anger problems, so a boy freaking out on her is par for the course.

I like how the puppet looks like a caricature of Anthony Hopkins.

The movie runs out of creative angles, leaving a predictable outcome that takes too long. But the performances were entertaining enough to get me to the finish line.","shudder, hooptober, hooptober5.0, killer toy",2024-04-05

Inspector Krogh (Lionel Atwill) carries a case containing information that Heinrich von Frankenstein wished to pass down to his son, Wolf (Basil Rathbone).

The town is wary of Wolf's arrival, considering the damage his father's monster inflicted on the community.

Wolf brings his wide Elsa (Josephine Hutchinson) and their son Peter to live in the family castle. The town comes to meet them at the train station but disperses when Wolf considers his father a good person.

At the castle, Wolf reads the papers his father left for him — instructions on how to continue the work that he started. He meets Inspector Krogh, who informs him that the murders have continued since Heinrich's death and the destruction of the monster.

When Wolf meets Ygor (Bela Lugosi), Ygor shows Wolf that the monster is not dead but merely sleeps. So, to save the family name, Wolf will awaken his father's creation and teach it to be good, whatever that means.

I didn't realize that <i>Young Frankenstein</i> is a spoof on this movie specifically, complete with the wooden-armed police inspector and stump-shouldered Ygor.

Wolf's son, Peter, is annoying but doesn't take up much screen time.

This movie abandons the fruiter tone of the previous film, <i>Bride of Frankenstein</i>, and brings a more Gothic atmosphere. The lighting echoes the exaggerated German Expressionism angles and contrasts.

The wind roars outside. In its whispers, a voice calls out to Claudia. Claudia wakes up to see someone hanging from her ceiling. The wind blows her windows open.

A doctor comes to check on Claudia. He claims it is an awful nightmare brought on by a nervous breakdown. The schoolmaster, whom the students call a witch, dismisses his concerns and believes Claudia will be fine.

Fellow schoolmates at this private boarding school come to visit Claudia. Claudia recalls her nightmare, in which she enters a tower forbidden to the students.

The students go to the tower together. Upon inspection, they find the tower unlocked. Though afraid, Kitty enters. None had been there, but Claudia remembers every detail.

The schoolmaster catches them. She forces them to stay at the school over the break instead of going home as punishment. She chastises Claudia, threatening to put her under psychological supervision if she continues.

Lucia, one teacher, pleads to the schoolmaster to watch out or they will have a repeat incident. The schoolmaster forbids her to discuss it, but Lucia knows it is their fault. She refers to the girl who hanged herself in the tower years ago.

The cinematography is dynamic and fluid, suggestive and subtle.

The story moves swiftly, developing its cast of students and teachers effortlessly. The pace slackens during the second act but picks up for a stellar finale.

Though not amazing, the performances are ideal for the story’s tone.

The film explores the fear adults have of teenage sexuality and the ways repression only strengthens their subversive tendencies. The students hide smut and wear more revealing pajamas when they can get away with it. The film also suggests that one or more of the students are repressing queer tendencies as well.

The teacher’s pet is the most chaste of the students. When her classmates force her to dance with them, she reluctantly joins. But when they force her to strip, she becomes frightened. Kitty takes up the helm and does her striptease. “This is just like Paris,” she says. But she stops when she sees the dead girl outside in the storm.

The ghost does not represent them, but the adults repress them.

Naturally, being written and directed by a man, it comes across as exploitative. But the underlying metaphor is accurate.

<blockquote><i>— Woman Police Officer Moss

<b>London, 1840s</b>
Dr. Thomas Bolton (Boris Karloff) is a surgeon by day who volunteers at a hospital in London's Seven Dials slum. He has one aim: to make surgery painless. He experiments with nitrous oxide as an anesthetic.

In one surgery, a patient wakes up mid-procedure, screaming in agony. To avoid another incident, he works to make the anesthetic stronger, adding opium to the mix. Bolton becomes addicted to the resulting gas.

In Bolton's addicted state, a gang of criminals, Black Ben (Francis de Wolff) and Resurrection Joe (Christopher Lee), exploit Bolton. To avoid blackmail, they force Bolton to sign forged death certificates, allowing them to kill at will and sell the bodies to the hospital.

This movie marks a proverbial passing of the torch from horror icon to horror icon. Karloff, still giving some of the best performances of his career at 70, acts alongside up-and-comer Christopher Lee, who became a household name to horror fans after his turn as Dracula in Hammer's <i>Horror of Dracula</i>.

Karloff has such a tenderness that watching Ben and Joe's exploitation is heart-wrenching.

The film is a beautiful black-and-white, creating rich shadows to interplay with the fog and lights. The movie drips in Gothic dread but pulls it into the slums and darker recesses of the city.

While on vacation in the French Alps, Regina decides to divorce her husband, Charles. There, she meets the charming Peter.

Back home in Paris, her apartment has been stripped of all belongings, and her husband, Charles, is dead. Charles sold their belongings for a substantial amount. But when the police found his body, the money was gone. Also, Charles had four different passports.

Regina learns of her husband's identity and that men he associates with believe that Regina has the money Charles promised. Meanwhile, Peter shows up to offer condolences. He's also awfully good at helping Regina escape these dangerous men. Too good, perhaps?

Dynamic, whip-fast, and delightful Technicolor — this movie is a double whodunit: who's got the money, and who's killing everyone.

It's got a silly sense of humor that is sometimes a little overbearing but never drags out too much. The film swings wildly from goofy jokes to grisly murders — not as uncommon today as it was then, which turned a lot of folks off to this movie.

<b>I've heard of faith healers, but faith killers??</b>

Isaiah Schmidt is the leader of an isolationist, Amish-adjacent cult called the Hittites, which forbids contact with outsiders

Near them live Jim and Martha on a farm called Our Blessing. Jim is Isaiah's son and a lapsed member of the Hittites, which helps when tensions brew between the cult members and the family.

One day, a fight erupts between cult member William and Faith Stohler, the daughter of another nearby family. William chases her off, calling her an infidel. Jim intervenes and tells William to go so as not to upset Isaiah.

That night, Jim finds the word ""incubus"" painted in his barn. He hears his tractor turned on. He goes to investigate, and the tractor kills Jim by crushing him against the wall.

At first, Martha and her friends believe it is William's doing and fear for their lives. But when they find William hanged, the mystery deepens.

<blockquote><i>I swear, these boys eat brimstone for dinner.</i></blockquote>The film is structured like a slasher but does not kill folks off left and right. I mean, people die, but they also have strange experiences. Also, the atmosphere and unusual setting help this stand out from typical genre fare. 

Farms are the scariest setting I can imagine (""Oh yeah, what about hell?"" says the contrarian in my head). Farms are disconnected from the outside world and full of cobwebs and nature.

Some aspects of the movie remind me of The Hills Have Eyes, and no, not just Michael Berryman. It's the way the Hittites stand on the horizon and the way they watch Martha.

Critics were so harsh on Ernest Borgnine. His acting style didn't translate into the 80s.

Mifanwy Conway wakes up to a startling laugh. Her husband asks her if she’s alright.

<blockquote><i>Yes, just that bad dream again.</i></blockquote>

The following morning, their daughters ran through the house screaming. Mifanwy lay awake, her eyes distant — that subtle resentment of getting what a different version of her wanted.

She travels to London after receiving a telegram. She keeps it secret from her husband and the tears it causes her. On the train, she thinks to herself a convenient summary:

<blockquote><i>How respectable they think I am, and I, happy. I, with my beautiful home, the perfect husband, and wonderful children. How shocked they’d be to learn my secret in London. I’m going to see my lover… His dreadful letters coming more frequently, threatening to break apart my home. If only I could tell my husband.</i></blockquote>

She goes to Madame Tussauds and meets the artist Paul Mangin — or rather, a waxwork figure of him. Through a flashback to seven years before, we learn of Paul’s obsession with Mifanwy — he believed they had been lovers in a past life.

Mifanwy’s journey takes us into the darkness, a world of jealousy and murder.

This movie is Terence Young’s first, co-written by producer Rudolph Cartier and Edana Romney, who stars as Mifanwy Conway. The film is a stunning blend of film noir and Gothic themes, the black and white a chiaroscuro cloud etched in the confidence of dream logic, reminiscent of Jean Cocteau.

Mifanwy and Paul are the epitome of #notLikeTheOtherGirls, defining themselves on a series of negations that can only permit ideals.

Critics hate Edana Romney’s performance, but she comes across as the sort of weirdo who would find Paul’s fixations attractive and let him define her.

Christopher Lee shows up as an associate of Paul named Charles. He doesn’t have lines, but his 6 ft 5 frame is hard to miss.

Brennan and Dale are two adult men who live with their parents — a joke in 2008, a reality in 2024. When their single parents marry one another, the two become stepbrothers. The movie follows the ensuing antics as the two learn to hate one another less.

McKay emerged in improv with a focus on edits and film language, giving the imaginative form a clear structure in the audience's mind.

He worked alongside the Upright Citizen Brigade founders to adapt their language to a TV format. UCB's core philosophy is that improv should be indistinguishable from written material.

The divergence between McKay and the UCB is in the follow-up. UCB envisions a writer's room where you improvise and transform ideas into written work. McKay's movies refuse that marriage, insisting that they film the improvisations and edit it down to the best jokes.

<i>Anchorman</i> was a comedic revelation. This movie captured the essence of friends hanging out and improvising while maintaining a loose structure.

The movie <i>Talladega Nights</i> repeated the formula — also successful, but less so.

This movie was also massively successful. I heard every joke from this movie before seeing it today. It's also lazy. Gone are the hangout vibes. Instead, we get insult comedy for two hours — its mean-spiritedness is infectious but doesn't feel good.

Adam McKay and his friends would not learn any lessons until the complete failure of <i>Anchorman 2</i>. McKay transitioned to ""important"" movies to sustain his career.

Also, around that time, Facebook killed Funny or Die by lying about the reach of their video service. Funny or Die switched to Facebook and died in obscurity.

Anyway, this movie isn't good. It's got momentum for the first 20-30 minutes, but it collapses once they do the job-hunting montage. Also, it just isn't my sense of humor.

Lee is a world-famous photojournalist known for her disturbing and frank photos from war-torn areas. Her head is full of people that she watched die.

<blockquote><i>We don't ask questions. We take the shot so someone else can ask them later.</i></blockquote>She and her colleague Joel plan to get the ultimate photo — a picture of the president. Their aging colleague Sammy calls it a suicide mission but tags along because, like all photojournalists, they have massive FOMO.

Jessie is a young, up-and-coming photojournalist. She idolizes Lee and takes the opportunity to tell her when she sees her at a riot/bombing. Through some finagling with Joel, and to Lee's disappointment, Jessie joins in on the journey.

Sammy and Joel say they see a young Lee in Jessie. Lee sees someone who still has an out and is taking a road with no return.

<blockquote><i>I've never been more scared in my life. I've also never felt so alive.</i></blockquote>The filmmakers shot the film in a narrow depth of field. Even when two characters stand beside each other, one is out of focus — because this is a story about the narrow field of vision that photojournalism gives us.

We like to believe in the objective photo — or at least the photo with enough truth to consider worthwhile. For as long as photography has existed, it has gone to war-torn areas to send a message home and hopefully keep what's happening in the war zone from happening at home.

This movie is called Civil War because it happens during a theoretical civil war on American soil. But the movie is only interested in that story as much as its characters are. These photojournalists took the photos to stop the war from coming to America. And they failed.

If you look for a social message or commentary in this movie, you will be disappointed. By design, it plays at a similar ""objectivity"" that photojournalism claims, allowing the characters and their responses to what is happening around them to tell the story.

One photographer, after a sniper shoots at them, finds a good angle for a photo. Another lays in the grass and looks at the beautiful flowers while men in uniform with no voiced allegiance work on taking out the sniper.

By looking at a photographer at the beginning of their career and one on board to the bitter end, we see the hunger that gets them going and the cost of years of desensitization.

People die — characters we get to know as well as strangers caught up in the fight. We watch and do not intervene. Some characters even pick up their camera to capture it.

I don't know how I feel about this movie yet, but I sure am thinking about it.

Millicent is a reformed burlesque dancer. After winning a beauty contest in her hometown, she travels to New York to become a model. There, she attends a casting call with a couch — you know what I mean — and contracts syphilis.

The film claims to be a warning to the youth about venereal diseases. Like <i>Reefer Madness</i>, however, this framing was a way for director Dwain Esper to portray exploitative subjects — burlesque, lesbianism, premarital sex, rape, and debaucherous parties.

Also, like <i>Reefer Madness</i>, it's a boring curio more than anything. Exploitation fans will appreciate it for historical purposes. Anyone else shouldn't bother.

A woman drives through narrow England streets, across a grassy knoll to the white Dover cliffs. Meanwhile, Virginia, a young girl in an Italian boarding school, walks with her classmates to a vista overlooking Florence.

The woman exits her vehicle and stands at the cliff's edge. Virginia cries aloud, ""Mommy!"" and stops dead in her tracks. She peers into the distance as if witnessing the scene in Dover.

The woman leaps from the cliff. Its jagged edges scrape across and cut into her face. Virginia screams and cries. The teacher comes to console Virginia, telling her that her mother is alright. Virginia sees her mother's body amidst the crashing waves below the cliffs.

<b>Italy, 1977</b>
Virgina, now an adult, has married Francesco. Her rich husband is going away on a business trip. During that time, Virginia plans to renovate a mansion he owns.

Virginia has a vision of a murdered woman — her first since childhood. The people are unfamiliar, but the location is her husband's mansion. She follows the visions, which lead her to cracked plaster. Behind it, a skeleton.

The police assume the skeleton is a murder victim at the hands of Francesco. Viriginia's visions lead her into a twisted dream where nothing is as it appears.

The complete movie title, in typical Giallo fashion, is <i>The Psychic: Murder to the Tune of the Seven Black Notes</i>.

Though bloody and bleak, this movie is far from the gorefests of Fulci's later <i>Gates of Hell</i> trilogy. It feels more like <i>A Lizard in a Woman's Skin</i>, with a stronger focus but less fun.

The film delights in the decadence of its setting — elaborate decor, horseback riding, beautiful gardens. It adds a bit of a Gothic quality, but the story leans more into the mystery than establishing an atmosphere.

I wish I found this as fun as others do. I like it, but it's not a movie I would watch again. Then again, I may have burnt myself out on Giallo.

When the clock strikes midnight, one buries the spade beneath the gallows. The magical power of the mandrake root brings luck to men but also misfortunes and pain.</i></blockquote>

Professor Briken is a scientist famed for his experiments regarding genetics and heredity.

He declares to his peers his intentions to experiment with the mandrake. 

He plans to impregnate a sex worker with a mandrake to observe the child's innate behavior and its environmental influence. No plant shows intention in its behavior, so why should a mandrake?

The story shares similarities with <i>Poor Things</i> — a woman conceived by a scientist's experiments escapes from his possessive household and has many sexual escapades while discovering her identity.

Here, the daughter Alarune's lack of empathy leads her to seduce and destroy men. Because I guess that's men's biggest fear.

Legend suggests the mandrake springs from a hanged man's semen, although the film doesn't explicitly state it. How very middle ages.

Different versions exist, but all derive from one Italian translation. If you can find one with some music added, I recommend it. This movie is already difficult to watch.

Vishal Bhatia is looking for an apartment for him and his wife, Swati. The broker reluctantly shows him a cheap duplex — cheap, because the previous resident fell off the building and died.

Vishal meets the apartment owner, Mr. Thakkar, who gives him the full story — that the previous tenant was a woman named Manjeet who committed suicide after killing her son.

Vishal is unbothered by this detail, not believing any superstitions about ghosts. He continues to hide this from Swati, who wouldn’t choose to live there. But as they live there, Swati's behavior changes and she sees dead people everywhere she goes.

Vishal explains it all away as her stupid dreams or her stupid soaps. Or he tells Swati she is stupid. But one night, he finds the watchman murdered. All signs point to Swati as the killer.

The score and sound effects are hilariously overbearing — think Sam Raimi with a Hindi twist. They even see Sam Raimi's <i>Spider-Man</i> in theaters. We hear several lines of dialogue from the movie.

Charles (Denholm Elliott) and Alice Hillyer move into the house. Charles works on a novel about a psychopathic killer named Dominic. Soon, Dominic materializes and stalks Charles, but no one believes him.

Phillip Grayson (Peter Cushing) moves into the house. As a retired stockbroker, he looks for hobbies but finds himself bored. This takes him to a wax museum, where he finds a wax figure that eerily resembles a woman he once loved but is now dead.

A small, bloodied boy enters a funeral to tell the congregants that Vardella has taken his sister. The people gather their torches and run to the caves where Vardella hides. A monstrous hand, inexplicably covered in hair and scales, emerges.

Vardella jumps out, her mouth bloodied, her skin dappled with disfiguration, her teeth barred in a sharp grimace. She claws at what faces she can. They restrain her and take her to the ducking stool. They tie her to the chair and demand she rebuke the devil. Instead, she curses the people and their descendants.

Cut back to the present day, where newlyweds Veronica (Barbara Steele) and Phillip (Ian Ogilvy) are lost in the country. They take a hotel room from a creeper named Ladislav Groper.

Veronica asks about the Draculas, and Von Helsing relishes the opportunity to tell them about the Draculas and Vardella.

The film spends a good chunk of its runtime focused on Charlotte's family, particularly Ethan's increased stress and how he fits into the family. Charlotte appears indifferent but has taken up drawing comics like Ethan.

That said, the emotional beats are so by the book that it's hard to connect to those parts. It spends a lot of time on them, but still not enough to develop characters.

The spider, however, is scary as fuck — they freak me out as it is. So, seeing one that grows to the size of a dog is uncomfortable.

The effects team built a practical spider, and it helped substantially. They use CGI for the more dynamic scenes, which they thankfully don't rely on too much.

I like the scares. I'm somewhat on board with the family parts, but I'm pretty disappointed with this script. I enjoyed it more than I expected, but this one will slip from my memory soon.","amc southpoint, nature attacks",2024-04-13
2024-04-14,Arcadian,2024,https://boxd.it/6gQXJb,3,,"In a near-future, post-apocalyptic world, Paul (Nic Cage) and his 15-year-old sons have holed up in a remote farmhouse. Thomas is handsome and horny, while Joseph is brilliant (aka gay). Since they've been alive, their father has shown them how to survive, prioritizing security over bravery.

Every night, without fail, the creatures that killed off most people try to break into their house. So far, the creatures haven't succeeded.

Thomas has been going to a nearby farm under the presumption of giving them a helping hand. But Paul knows the truth — that the farmer has a daughter named Charlotte whom Thomas goes to see.

One evening, after staying with Charlotte too late into the day, Thomas runs back home, only to fall into a crevasse. When Thomas doesn't return on time, Paul looks for him.

Each of them will face these creatures for the first time.

The movie relies on broad archetypes over any characters, as well as our knowledge of <i>A Quiet Place</i>, <i>It Comes At Night</i>, and the myriad other films of a similar ilk.

It retains that similar understated quiet with explosions of violence. It also makes one innovation that comes later into the story that helps this stand out.

Though it's by the books, Nic Cage and Jaden Martell give outstanding performances. Cage doesn't go full Cage, unfortunately, but it wouldn't have worked here.

The creatures, giving nothing away, are unusual and don't seem thought out beyond the set pieces their stature/abilities provide. A couple of them are baffling and made me snort.

Also, it's way too dark. If I'm in a pitch-black theater and still can't tell what's happening, you've got a lighting problem. I understand why — they want to hide the budget creature effects.

The film's ironic title doesn't have a deeper meaning, just like the movie itself. But that's okay — I still like the movie.","amc southpoint, post-apocalypse, edited by women",2024-04-13

A plane lands. Then another. And another. The heat off the surface of the tarmac creates a rippling mirage effect where the airplanes look like they are underwater — above the ground and on it simultaneously.

In the desert, between land and sky, riding on the horizon are blue lakes — a Fata Morgana: illusory mirage that appears above the actual image, sometimes reflecting the object.

There's something powerful and strange about a natural illusion that a camera can capture. How were ancient people to discern from its scientific possibility and the mythical effect of gods on the world? What do you call a phenomenon that lies so directly to your senses?

The film also visits people who live in these supposedly uninhabitable places. It does everything possible to strip any narrative from their lives. In one way, it allows them to be what you see. In another, it strips them of agency and makes them props to whatever narrative you desire. This is probably what Harmony Korine took most from Herzog's work.

The meta-narrative is so dense — an abandoned science fiction narrative, countless arrests, beatings, and abandoned equipment in brutal weather conditions.

The movie's most immediate impact was in the psychedelic movement, which reduced the film to a drug movie.

What is onscreen is ambiguous in intent but amounts to the purest road movie. It's also the fertile breeding ground of Herzog's obsessions with the stark realities of living and the narratives we construct to make it tolerable. Herzog and the filmmakers he influenced would revisit this film like the plane landing in the opening.

In other words, the film is an incomplete drawing begging to be completed.

In college, I attended a guest lecture, and he asked the audience if anyone had seen <i>Fata Morgana</i>. I was the only one who raised my hand. And I was lying! I don't know why I lied about it, but a professor said after the lecture, ""I can't believe you've seen that obscure Herzog movie."" Panicked, I said, ""I eat Herzog for breakfast.""

A shotgun blows a tire out on a passing car. Bruno's black boots step out of the car and scream at the tire. He goes to the boot to get a spare, but there isn't one.

Bruno hitches with a minister. He tries to take the minister's car at gunpoint but shoots him and crashes the car instead.

So, Bruno takes the minister's clerical collar and hitches a ride from Magnolia. He pulls the same routine with the gun, but Magnolia complies. When Bruno isn't looking, Magnolia stabs him in the head with a hair bodkin, stuffs him in a body bag, and reapplies her lipstick before taking him to a remote villa.

Auntie Lee (Karen Black) greets her, angry about Magnolia's run hoses and bruised face, but softens when she learns Bruno is 250 lbs. Larry (Michael Berryman) takes Bruno's body to the barn.

So goes the routine for Auntie Lee's hired women — find a man, bring him back to the villa any way they can so Larry can process them. For what? Why, Auntie Lee's famous Meat Pies.

But when the girls accidentally take a guy with an important New York father, a private investigator questions everyone.

The movie feels like the missing link between <i>Texas Chainsaw Massacre II</i> and <i>House of 1000 Corpses</i>. This movie retains the campy cannibalism of <i>Texas Chainsaw</i> and brings Karen Black's signature oddball charisma that has made her a horror movie favorite.

Carnival rides, cotton candy, games, exotic dancers,  (??), sword swallowing, snake charming — yep, this is a lot of carnival b-role. Finally, the film moves into the freak show tent.

<blockquote><i>There are only two kinds of freaks, ladies and gentlemen: those made by God and those made by man... Look, if you must</i></blockquote>We transition to Jade working her miserable diner job. The men who dine there and her boss hit on her, and she pushes them all away. Her boss asks:

<blockquote><i>— Who do you think you are?
— I know who I am. I'm nobody, just like you.</i></blockquote>Jade looks for a way out of her current life. Steve, the carnival owner, comes in. Jade asks him for any extra work, and she gets work serving meals to the carnival staff.

Everything goes well until she sees the freak show. Her disgust upsets Moon, who tries to help her see them as God's creatures.

Soon, it becomes clear that this movie is a remake of Tod Browning's <i>Freaks</i> told from Cleopatra's perspective. Here, Jade takes Cleopatra's role and gives the audience a more sympathetic look at the dregs of life that motivate so much cruelty.

The movie's most prominent issue is its bloated runtime. The original Freaks was just over an hour, and this has less to say. So, we get a ton of carnival B-role.

Then again, it's all filmed at a real carnival, so it feels down to earth. And it gets a little hypnotic/vibey after a while, especially at night.

The movie doesn't become ""horror"" until literally the last 3 minutes.

Nicky (John Cassavetes) wakes up disheveled, glancing at the hotel room door. Slivers of newspaper cover the bed like a makeshift blanket. Half-smoked cigarettes fill the ashtray and the Coke bottle on the side table — empty cartons and trash litter the dresser.

He grabs his Fitz Colt in one hand and a bent cigarette in the other hand. The newspaper reads, ""Slain Bookie Called 'Small-Time Hood.'"" He picks up the phone and gives the operator a number.

<blockquote><i>Mikey, I'm in trouble.</i></blockquote>

Nicky gives Mikey the instructions on where to meet him and how — don't want to draw attention. Mikey (Peter Falk) arrives at the street corner, looking for Nicky, hiding in his hotel room.

Nicky throws a J&B bottle wrapped in a towel out the window to get Nicky's attention. Perplexed in that beautiful Peter Falk way, Mikey sees the Royale Hotel across the way and enters.

<blockquote><i>Hey Nicky, it's Mikey. I came as soon as I got your towel.</i></blockquote>

Nicky tells Mikey that Nickey knows there's a hit out for him. After 30 years of friendship, Mikey gives him an antacid and grabs some coffee. When the diner doesn't sell cream to-go, Mikey jumps over the counter and strangles him. The lady in the background looks at the camera, unsure about what is happening.

One wild night starts with two friends - the one who messes up and who cleans up the mess. Both are oddballs with issues, but Mikey's figured out how to keep his nose clean. If Nicky could follow Mikey's lead, he might stay out of trouble. Or, he might die sooner.

Elaine May of the comedy duo Nichols and May doesn't get as much attention for her directorial work as her comedy partner, Mike Nichols. Paramount's interference with this movie resulted in a disappointing release. She even tried to hide her reels so they wouldn't fuck up her film. The bad press kept her from directing for a decade. Her comeback movie? The infamous <i>Ishtar</i>.

Thankfully, Criterion remastered her director's cut and put it in their collection because this script is so fucking funny, witty, and painful.

The most common comparison I've seen to this movie is <i>Mean Streets</i>. <i>Mean Streets</i> is a great movie — one of Scorsese's best. Yet, this outshines it in every imaginable way. 

We can't choose a side so easily. At some points, Nicky seems too paranoid to bear. At others, Mikey's weirdness makes Nicky's paranoia feel justified. It never settles — the characters or their dynamic. Each movie moment contributes to their complicated history. Most directors would aim towards a portrait. But May errs on the side of an obfuscating stroke that keeps it ambiguous.

The pace is immaculate. The actors are incredible improvisers guided by one of the forerunners of the form. This film does the impossible and avoids the self-indulgence that plagues so many Cassavetes movies. May understands sleazy, selfish men — she came up in a circuit dominated by them. She also knows how to get these self-obsessed boys to do her script — she wrote this movie, and they did what she wrote.

A pivotal scene for me is when they see one of Nicky's girls, Nell (Carol Grace in one of her two film roles). She's well-read and desperate for an outlet. Mikey wants to hear her thoughts on the Indochina conflict, but Nicky won't let her get a word in edge-wise. He laughs when she talks; he answers questions for her, and he tries to kiss her and fuck her mid-conversation.

<blockquote><i>— Don't you have any respect for me?
— Sure, I do. I have plenty of respect for you. But you make it so hard for me because I like you.</i></blockquote>

But then, when it's just Mikey and Nell, Mikey drops the pretense of hearing her thoughts and tries to kiss Nell.

I don't love the ""one wild night"" schtick because it becomes an excuse for a director to throw everything at the wall and make an incoherent mess. This movie isn't one wild night — it's the night this friendship has been running towards for decades.","criterion channel, criterion, criterion challenge 2024, directed by women, written by women",2024-04-15

John Verney reluctantly attends a book release party for his new book, The Devil Walks Among Us, which focuses on the occult. Catherine’s father Henry crashes the party to find John.

Henry asks John to intercept Catherine at the airport and to save her from the Children of Our Lord. He believes the Children of Our Lord are a Satanic cult, which intrigues John.

John questions Catherine and deduces that the cult intends to use Catherine for a ritual on her birthday.

The movie takes its time revealing its purpose. There’s something about a disgusting newborn and the youth of the world needing a change. And the grimoire of Ashteroth.

Christopher Lee is a sick little freak in this. He performs some black magic and has delightfully evil eyes. There’s also a satanic orgy, which is pretty wild for, like, two seconds.

Denholm Elliott also gets to be a strung-out weirdo, but he doesn’t do much else.

Like several of these movies, it hits the 20-minute left mark and says, “Oh yeah, this is a horror movie” and starts having a good time. Even so, it resolves to a “boring white guy” off where they exposit to the last second what they’re doing, like kids play-fighting and one kid refuses to go down because he has a force field he forgot to tell you about.

In Philadelphia, on WGON-TV, a guest on an interview program laments how we have let morality and emotions inhibit handling this. The zombies are slow, and it only takes a headshot to kill them. But they look like loved ones, and people don't act. Also, folks assume they're easy to evade because they're slow. Statistics show otherwise.

Stephen, a traffic reporter, sneaks over to Fran, a producer, to tell her he's planning on stealing a helicopter. She tries to talk him out of it, but he is dead-set.

Meanwhile, a SWAT team is infiltrating a housing project, calling for Martinez to give up his weapons. Although the official purpose is to surrender the deceased to the National Guard, several officers secretly desire to harm Puerto Rican and Black residents.

Gunfire erupts, with deaths on both sides. Roger tries to keep people out of danger, but cops shoot with no discernment, killing everyone they see. Soon, those killed come back and attack the officers.

<blockquote><i>Shoot it, man. Shoot it in the head!</i></blockquote>Roger meets Peter, an officer on a different team, in the basement. Roger plans on meeting up with Stephen and invites Peter along. The four take the chopper to a secluded shopping mall, where a few dozen zombies wander.

<blockquote><i>— What are they doing? Why do they come here?
— Some kind of instinct — memory — what they used to do. This was an important place in their lives.</i></blockquote>They hole up until a better option arrives — if a better option arrives.

I don't know what version I watched. It lasted 2.5 hours, which doesn't match any known runtimes. This one includes flubs like Fran calling Stephen ""David"" (the actor's name). I would rather watch the theatrical cut. I'll take what I can find.

Tom Savini's effects are gnarly! Hooray for Vietnam War trauma? While the scabs and makeup look dated, the blood and gore are effective. Some standouts (no context to avoid spoilers):

* Head explosion
* Biting off chunks of woman's shoulder and arm
* Helicopter blade scalping
* Screwdriver in the ear
* Headshot where eyeball flies out
* Savini head chop
* Ripping dudes apart

This movie's influence is everywhere, including the recent <i>Civil War</i>. They share the sprawling effect on the country and the downtime between hysteria and devastation.

Something, something consumerism — it's not subtle and overstated throughout. The many movies that followed its example influenced my opinion.

The film delves into the strain of quarantine on relationships. Reality fades, and the world stands still — the routines, the anger, the alcoholism. The feeling that you have everything you want, but it isn't enough.

I'd probably rate this higher if it were shorter. This version has so much hanging out. On one hand, it engenders us to the characters.

Dennis Cleg (Ralph Fiennes) exits a train. He reaches into his waistband and pulls out a sock full of papers. From it, he fetches a sheet of paper with an address. As he walks, he mumbles to himself. He stops to pick up things. Eventually, he arrives at a halfway house run by Mrs. Wilkinson (Lynn Redgrave).

Dennis looks over his new room — a twin bed, a folding table with a lamp, and a sink in the corner. He sees the small chimney. He catches his breath as he opens a window to the factory noises outside his window.

Late one night, he looks through a window and sees his childhood self playing string games while his mother (Miranda Richardson) cuts potatoes. His young self wanders down to the pub to find his father (Gabriel Byrne) talking to a prostitute named Yvonne (Miranda Richardson).

Soon, the walls between the outside world and his internal reality dissolve. The traumas of his childhood and the foundation of his illness replay and disintegrate.

Ralph Fiennes embodies this psychologically disturbed man and pulls us into his unrelenting experience. The film integrates with his hallucinations and disorganized thinking.

Nothing about the experience suggests sympathy on behalf of the filmmakers — only to create as accurately as possible the experience of a schizophrenic mind.

Perhaps the most sympathetic approach to the material is to avoid reducing it to inspiration porn.

Instead, observe how the mind organizes experiences into truth and highlight the unreliability of memory and experience, including events the person could not have witnessed.

Miranda Richardson does a tremendous job in the dual roles of the mother and Yvonne. They feel like two different people but similar enough that it feels uncanny.

Let me be clear: this story is disturbing — so disturbing that it can also read exploitative. But that’s a line that Cronenberg has always walked to varying degrees of success.

Lambert awaits their arrival and gives them the rundown: babysit the girl for 24 hours while Lambert negotiates a $50 million ransom. Meanwhile, the rules are no phones in case of tracking, no names, and no backstories. They assign each person a false name for communication.

Joey (Melissa Barrera) checks on the girl. She takes off the girl's blindfold and loosens her cuffs. Joey pinky-promises the girl that she will keep her safe and not let Frank (Dan Stevens) or the others hurt her. They exchange names: the girl calls herself Abigail.

After they find one of them brutally murdered, the group pieces together the girl's father is one of the most dangerous men in the city. Will they survive the night? Will further secrets unfold? Is the house possibly harboring the most dangerous individual?

The trailer played often at the theater but failed to catch my attention. But I was a fan of the two directors' films <i>Scream V</i> and <i>Ready or Not</i>, so I figured I'd give it a shot. Without seeing the trailer, you might still see the direction.

The script was pretty bland, and it feels like people are peppering in expletives to spice up the weak lines. It's a by-the-book story, making the movie predictable.

But. The cast's performances create a reason to watch the movie by having a blast on-screen.

I like Dan Stevens, and I'm happy to see him in a few horror movies this year — this and <i>Cuckoo</i>.

I liked Melissa Barrera in <i>Scream</i>, but she comes out and shines in this one.

Abigail would've been scarier if they let Alisha Weir talk in her Irish accent. She gives a solid performance — not world-shaking, but good enough to sell her role.

Kevin Durand is the ugliest man alive, and I love seeing his face in anything <b>#Lost</b>

This movie was Angus Cloud's last before his death. He did well because his character is annoying as fuck — I wanted to blame the actor.

The gore was over-the-top. The directors can't end a movie without someone drenched in blood. It may be too much for some people — lots of skin being ripped off and whatnot.

The set was perfect — I love a spoopy old mansion with Gothic shit everywhere.

Dr. Serena Kogan (Helena Bonham Carter) convinced death row inmate Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) to sell his body to #science.

Meanwhile, Skynet realizes it doesn't want to generate art for tech bros, so it initiates a nuclear holocaust. Watching this movie almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter.

<b>2018</b>
John Conner (Christian Bale) leads a resistance attack against ChatGPT and learns about the T-800. The news is so upsetting he yells at a sound guy.

Marcus wakes up in LA and runs into Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) and a mute child named Star. Kyle is a part of the #resistance. He hears a broadcast from John and says, ""We gotta meet this guy!""

Marcus is, like, clearly a machine sent into the future to kill John Conner so that he won't send Kyle Reese to 1984 to protect Sarah Connor from the T-800 and thereby impregnate her with John Connor, who will rely on a reformed T-800 sent back by John Connor to avoid being killed by a T-1000 in 1995 sent back to kill John Connor.

I didn't see Terminator 3, so I have no idea how its plot plays into this, if at all.

I'm in a hotel nursing a hangover. This movie was on HBO, so I gave it a go.

Common is in the movie. I was like, ""Is that Common?"" Turns out it was.

The production is expensive and slick in that McG way. The terminators feel heavier than they have in previous movies. But some of the CGI is so loopy and spastic that it undercuts all the effort.

The most compelling idea is that Skynet weaponized Marcus without his knowledge. The Akira and Blade Runner nods are there — it wants to talk about an android/weapon that doesn't know it.

Also, since Marcus is a former convict, it looks at how he wants redemption in a system that won't give him the opportunity. The film has too many competing interests, so it underserved the theme.

Anton Yelchin says, ""Come with me if you want to live,"" because I guess someone has to say it at least once every Terminator movie.

Around this time, Chaplin made silent movies because he could, not because he needed to. His Tramp was never successful with lines, so why spoil what works? The film is ""sound-assisted,"" where sound effects and Charlie-Brown-teacher sounds sync with the images.

I've voiced it before, but I don't get much out of Charlie Chaplin movies. I get why he's one of the most beloved characters in movie history, but watching his films always feels like homework.

<blockquote><i>Curiosity is the finest thing in life.</i></blockquote>
Wisely sits in his house by lamplight. All around him are stacks of books and empty bottles of vodka. He writes an account of three people — two humans and a cat, to be precise — and the stories of folks's encounters with these three, starting with Li Tung.

Li startles awake in the dead of night to the sound of knocking upstairs. The ceiling shakes with erratic movement, dust, and drywall showering down on him — a common occurrence. He grabs an implement and charges upstairs to give them a piece of his mind.

Li bangs on his neighbor's door. The neighbor, an older man, comes to the door and apologizes. Behind his neighbor, a woman picks up a fluffy black cat. Their eyes meet Li's, pulling him into a trance. Only his neighbor waving his bloodied hand in front of Li's face brings him to. Before Li can ask any questions, the neighbor shuts the door.

The following day, Li sees his neighbor, the woman, and the cat leave in a moving van. He goes to the apartment to investigate. The place is empty, except for one room full of bloody newspapers. He finds a pile of cat intestines.

Li, police inspector Wang Chieh-Meh, Wisely, and Wisely's partner Pai So eat crab at Wisely's house. Wisley divulges his theory that the girl and the cat are aliens from another galaxy. The film follows Wisley's investigation as to what the three are doing. He learns about the Star Killer and their intentions to stop it.

From the director of <i>Riki-Oh</i>, the film is a weirdo blend of horror, action, and sci-fi with an expected amount of gore and violence.

The plot is quite loose, so it feels like things just happen for a lot of it. But when a wild scene comes into focus, it's hard not to forgive and enjoy the insanity.

The ending is one of the most batshit things I've seen in my life. It was such a bizarre mixture of earnest emotion and special effects.

This could be a new comfort movie for me.

<blockquote><i>He who robs the graves of Egypt dies.</i></blockquote>

<b>Egypt, 1895</b>
Egyptian men work for the Banning family, who are British archaeologists. One man uncovers a jade artifact — on one side, a scarab; on the other, a hieroglyphic inscription. Stephen takes the artifact and shows it to his brother, Joseph — he believes it proves they’re on the right track.

Stephen also shows the artifact to his son, John (Peter Cushing), whom Joseph thinks they should send home because of his broken leg. John thinks they’re only four or five days away from completing the work Stephen began twenty years ago: to uncover the tomb of Princess Ananka.

Mehemet Bey (George Pastell) finds the dig and warns them not to continue digging.

They ignore Mehemet’s warnings and enter, cutting the bound cord that deals the tomb closed. Upon finding the sarcophagus, Joseph leaves to tell John. Meanwhile, Stephen finds The Scroll of Life in the tomb.

Outside, Joseph hears Stephen scream. He runs inside to find Stephen babbling incoherently, lying on the ground.


<b>England, 1898</b>
Stephen comes out of a catatonic state to ask for John. When John comes to see him, Stephen tells John about The Scroll of Life — that when Stephen read from it, he awoke Kharis, the high priest of Karnak (Christopher Lee), who will get vengeance on everyone who desecrated the tomb.

John doesn’t believe him. But when he sees Kharis for himself, he can no longer doubt.

This film is one of the early Hammer adaptations of the Universal monsters. They did <i>The Curse of Frankenstein</i>, <i>Dracula</i>, and then <i>The Mummy</i>.

<i>The Mummy</i> is my least favorite of the original Universal films. The movie is predominantly boring ceremonies and little action.

The film doesn’t enhance the material much. Christopher Lee, at 6ft5, is perfect as an imposing figure — he proves himself as Karloff’s successor. However, the movie still features people in brownface. At least George Pastell is from Cyprus.

The movie also has so much flashback! You could play the film in chronological order and it would fix most of the pacing problems.

George and Karen have a delightful day of croquet and wine for his 40th birthday. A call interrupts their evening, and Karen has to fly off to deal with a family emergency.

That night, he phones Karen while it pours outside. The doorbell rings. George answers and finds two women, Jackson and Donna, soaking wet, looking for the Gregory residence. He doesn't know any Gregory.

They ask to use the phone, and he obliges. They try to get a ride and ask to stay until their friend picks them up. They dry off and sit by the fire. They are flirtatious with George — complimenting his record collection and vibes. They run off to the bathroom. After a long time, he checks on them and finds them in the hot tub.

They coerce him to have sex with them in the hot tub. He wakes up the following day to find them making breakfast. He asks why their friend didn't pick them up, but they make an excuse. Soon, George realizes that Donna and Jackson don't intend to listen to George or to leave.

I didn't realize <i>Knock Knock</i> was a remake. Not that I've seen it — I remember the trailer and the premise was similar.

On the surface, this is yet another ""women seduce and ruin man"" story. And it's not, not that. But here, George is not innocent. He invites these women into his house and is complacent with having sex with them, but once they stop being a fantasy, he grows aggressive and tries to control them.

<blockquote><i>Are you angry with me? I only wanted to love you, Daddy.</i></blockquote>The movie regularly uses the song ""Good Old Dad,"" further pushing the gross abuse of a father/daughter dynamic.

Still, the movie emphasizes men's fear over women's empowerment. It is only feminist in how it overturns the patriarchal order.

The script makes some choices that it doesn't know how to get out of and makes some impossible leaps. It could be dream/nightmare logic — it's not important why or how things happen, but George cannot escape it. But for a movie that claims to be ""based on a true story,"" it can't have it both ways.

Seymour Cassel is such an odd lead choice, but he has such '70s dad energy that it's perfect.

Vickie sees a punk pouring gasoline on an older man at the gas station. She begs the attendant to do something, but he only watches. So, Vickie pushes the punk off the man, threatening to call the police.

When she gets home, she sees the man and a few others parked outside her house. She calls the police, but they tell her they can't do anything. The men break in and kill Scott with a shotgun. The man she stopped beats her and stabs her, leaving her in critical condition.

I get so bored with these kinds of characters — every Vin Diesel character — where they’re flawlessly badass and never experience fear or setbacks.

Every time the plot finds a path forward, everything comes to a halt so we can receive yet another warning about Riddick and yet another speech from Riddick that proves he knows everything about everything.

The world-building is also sloppy. None of the buildings have lights because the three suns never set. But they consistently eclipse one another, creating the pitch black that only Riddick can navigate. They would need lights then, right?

In Ireland, Siobhan is a PhD student studying deep-sea fauna. She purchases a place on a fishing skip called the Niamh Cinn Óir. Only Diet Oscar Isaac (DOI) knew. Captain Freya and her husband, Gerard, worry that a redhead on board is bad luck.

As they set off, the Coast Guard warns them that their destination is in an exclusion zone. Freya orders them to find an alternative. Gerard goes into the zone without them knowing because they say the area is teeming with fish, and they need a large haul to pay their crew.

 The ship collides with an unidentified object inside the exclusion zone, resulting in hull breaches and their capture. Diet Riz Ahmed (DRA) and DOI noticed the wood takes on an unusual texture. The hull breaches contain an unusual slime. Behind them looks like a starfish.

Sailors don’t dive, but Siobhan brought her diving gear, so they gave her a knife to go underwater and cut the boat free. When she goes under, she finds tentacles attached to the ship attached to a bioluminescent creature. Whatever the entity emitted from its tentacles has contaminated the ship. After DRA gets a cut, the residual slime gets into his wound, causing an unusual illness.

While everyone tries to avoid the substance, Siobhan looks for a way to stop the infection. Meanwhile, the crew quarantines on the ship — if they don’t die first.
The movie is a compelling idea, even if the pacing isn’t ideal. The biggest issue is the script, which has everyone making irrational choices to keep the plot going.

The film has no comprehensible dialogue or subtitles — no guidance through this world. Not that the movie needs it — it's worth knowing beforehand.

I don't know if I love this as much as I did when I first saw it, but I still like how this movie feels. I like how it draws out the cruelest aspects of grief. And Toni Collette is iconic — her performance floors me every time I see it.


<b>*** SPOILER TALK ***</b>
Back to the mommy trauma lens. In that sense, the movie feels much more like a manifestation of Annie's mental illness. But as I'm writing that out, I'm talking myself out of it.

No theory fully works, which is why this movie is fun. But it's also why I love it a little less. In good ambiguity, you feel like there is an answer, but it's irrelevant. Here, it feels like the ending was trying to get to <i>Rosemary's Baby</i> without doing the legwork.","amc southpoint, owen",2024-04-24

Two young boys, George and Michael, sit at home. The radio warns of a maniac on the loose with a meat cleaver in one hand and his genitals in another. While Michael tries to hypnotize the dog, bangs erupt against the front door. A hand rips holes through it and emerges through. Blood spatters his disheveled shirt as he holds a meat cleaver above his head.

The kids recognize him — he’s their beloved Uncle Anwar.

Uncle Anwar reminds them of their favorite story of the ancient Lemurians and the goddess Sheetar. He gives them some amulets before the police pull up. Anwar runs at the police with his cleaver, chanting Sheetar, as the police fill him full of lead.

Cut to the present day. The security guard at a grave site comes across adult George and Michael digging up their uncle. One hits the guard with a shovel, causing the guard’s eyeballs to fly out. The boys extract Anwar’s brain, put it in a jar, and perform a resurrection spell.

Anwar gives them their instructions: collect body parts to create a vessel for Sheetar and provide a “blood buffet” for Sheetar to consume.

The movie is an absurd comedy, riffing in a splatter-filled world reminiscent of an HG Lewis movie. Every diner is vegetarian, and a beloved patron is a disfigured mannequin. In one of the film’s most notorious scenes, the brothers don Ronald and Nancy Reagan masks and shoot up a nude aerobicizing cheerleader squad.

Jackie Kong aimed to create a movie so outrageous it would catch even the most jaded genre fan off-guard. She also made the brothers hot boys, which makes them more sympathetic in their goofy antics. Rick Burks was a hottie, and that might be why I continued watching.

Kong also brought her crew from Night Patrol, comprised mostly of women. Also, Ellen Steloff, the EP, was the main reason the studio green-lit the film. I only bring it up because folks often throw movies like these into the pile of “orgiastic male fantasy.” But it’s not uncommon to find women behind some of the most fucked up horror films, especially in the no-budget arena.

The film started as a sequel to <i>Blood Feast</i>, but the distributor didn’t think anyone would remember it. I don’t love HG Lewis or Splatter, so adding a more absurdist layer over it makes it much more tolerable.

Anna and Steve meet in secret. Steve worries her husband will find out, but Anna has to see him. They go over their plan once more and where they'll meet. Anna assures him it will finally be as it should have been: she and him from the beginning.

Back at the club, Slim Dundee notices Anna's return and questions her intentions. Steve hides in plain sight. He pulls Dundee into an armored truck robbery. Like all schemes, however, it doesn't go according to plan.

The film follows the double-crosses, betrayals, and cynical darkness that epitomizes film noir. Robert Siodmak received little love, but critics have reappraised his movies as the foundation of our cultural understanding of the genre.

The film follows that painful logic of wondering if you could have another shot with someone you loved. Time can erode the painful memories and distort the nice ones. Feelings seem permanent — yet here you are again, searching in the places that got you hurt.

Suddenly, here you are, in town with them. All the good feelings come flooding back. They're with somebody else, but wasn't what you had special enough? Didn't it hurt you when they left?

Paul and Mary prepare the house for George, his wife, Vivian, and their daughter, Cathy. Something binds itself to Cathy, connecting her experience to memory. She goes into the attic. When she comes out, her behavior changes as she fixates on a car wreck and develops a violent temperament.

<blockquote><i>— All women are bitches. Repeat.
— All women are bitches.</i></blockquote>

Whoever wrote this script hates women and especially hates his wife. The word ""bitch"" is in every scene and said with such relish.

I feel so terrible for Vivian, who is going through a deep depression after a miscarriage. At first, George seems supportive, but he blows up on her for any worry she might have.

The script is incoherent — we get no sense of why Laura's spirit drives Cathy to do what she does beyond the misogyny her father imparted.

Ippolita, who is paralyzed from the waist down since 12, tries to walk to the statue but falls. Her father hands her her cane, and they leave. When she returns to her estate, a maid cries for her.

Ippolita sees her father embrace Greta and confirms her suspicions that he is dating her. The revelation breaks her heart, as she has grown anxiously attached to her father.

Ippolita visits her uncle, a priest. He feels a psychic turmoil and takes her to a parapsychologist who performs past life regression with her. The idea is that the experience could help her paralysis

Through that, Ippolita experiences her ancestor, who was a witch during the Inquisition. The ancestor had made a pact with Satan.

It's around here that <i>The Exorcist</i> similarities come in: her voice changes as she rants about sucking cock, and her mouth foams. The paintings fly off the walls to fervent violin and Satanic laughter.

Elias and Lukas, twin ten-year-old boys, explore and play hide-and-seek. Lukas comes to a cave that appears pitch black. The sound of buzzing flies greets him as they enter the darkness.

A car drops off their mother, who has returned from a cosmetic surgery. They find her in the bedroom. Bandages encompass her head, with holes around her eyes and her mouth. In the darkness, the holes create a sinister smile. Below her eyes are heavy bruises.

Their mother insists that the blinds stay closed during the day. She ignores Lukas and only gives Elias any attention — she only cooks for Elias or gives him anything to drink. She enforces the house must remain silent. They can only play outside — even if it’s playing video games. If they disobey, she assaults Elias.

Elias and Lukas suspect that this is not their mother.

The house has several unusual characteristics. Several rooms have enlarged photos of blurry women — perhaps the mother. Alcoves on the wall have elongated figurines, like sketches done for fashion pieces. Below the house is an endless supply of cockroaches and human bones.

The film explores a genuine feeling from childhood, where parents change and they become unrecognizable.

I grew up with an inconsistent mother. It felt like a different mom would come home some days. I felt like I was going crazy when she would punish me for no obvious reason at random times. 

It didn’t matter whether she was my mom — I didn’t feel safe in her presence.

<b>Another Jonathan Demme movie where he uses Goodbye Horses</b>

Angela (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Frank (Alec Baldwin) are on the rocks. Frank is moving up in the mob family, and Angela is sick of the mob, the wives, and the whole life. When their son finds Frank's gun, Angela asks for a divorce. Frank laughs and tells her to take a valium.

Tony (Dean Stockwell) has a girl, Karen. Frank and her are secretly seeing each other. But when Frank gets to the hotel to meet her, Karen has a bullet in her head, and Tony is waiting. Tony shoots Frank.

On suspicion of Tony killing Karen and Frank, FBI Agent Mike (Matthew Modine) gets a 24-hour detail on Tony so he can finally take the family out.

Meanwhile, Tony chases Angela while Angela is on her way out. But when Tony makes a move, the mob wives and the FBI catch it, thinking she's having an affair with Tony. The FBI tails Angela, thinking she'll lead them to Tony.

But Angela and Mike meet cute, and Mike lies about living in the building. With all these plates spinning, what's going to drop first?

I had a hard time getting into the movie at first. I'm so over mob shit, and the first act wasn't doing much for me. When it gets soft and cute, though, I'm having a tremendous time.  

The movie shows the most personality when a character's internal thought process leaks into reality — when dream logic and irrational fear overtake the movie. The hit at the restaurant has a weird dreaminess — a slo-mo clown with a gun in each hand.

Michelle Pfeiffer is outstanding — this was her breakthrough role, and it makes sense. 

I initially hated Matthew Modine — but as it got more into the romcom parts, I understood his choices. His room, having a Buster Keaton/Rube Goldberg method of getting dressed, is a bold choice, but it sets in our head that we're supposed to see him as a Harold Lloyd type — a sincere doof who falls in love and trouble with equal ease.

Connie breaks my heart — Mercedes Ruehl is perfect.

Dean Stockwell shouldn't work in this role, but he does?? Maybe I'm underselling him. He wasn't good in <i>Battlestar Galactica</i> or <i>The Wicker Man</i>, and I haven't seen <i>Quantum Leap</i>, so I assumed he wasn't that good of an actor.

The credit sequence is so weird! It continues the story, I think?? It even has a post-credit sequence.

This movie came together eloquently! It goes through many familiar troupes and puts a personal spin on each one. This movie is the first time I've felt like Jonathan Demme as auteur has made sense to me.","tubi, birth year challenge",2024-04-27

Aubrey Beardsley lives behind a painting condemned to immortality. 

A couple opens the gate to the estate. Aubrey is afraid they will wake him. 

When they get inside, they find a four-poster bed. The guy pulls the blankets back, lights a candle, and invites her girl into his arms. They set out food for a small picnic.

While they're making out, a foam builds and consumes the apple. It pulls the wine and fried chicken into the bed and consumes them. Finally, the bed consumes the couple.

Aubrey watches in horror, unable to intervene. He watches each victim's plight through individual vignettes.

This movie is the correct definition of a cult movie. It didn't receive a physical release until 2003. Before then, folks shared it through bootleg VHS tapes. Writer/Directo George Barry didn't know of any bootlegs until he saw them mentioned in a forum in 2001.

The sets are so sparse. It looks like a stage.

Why is there a real playwright behind the painting? Is he there to provide a commentary on what the bed is thinking? But why an actual person??

She puts sleeping pills in her shake, ready to end it all. But starting with setting her bed on fire, she keeps running into obstacles that keep her from going through with it.

The film explores women structuring themselves and their aesthetic for men and how it fails. The sets have an artificial, highly saturated quality, especially Pepa's apartment. It is womanhood as envisioned by a gay boy who read his mother's fashion magazines.

The story moves at an unusual pace. It kicks into gear in the third act — before that, it's a little like a hangout comedy.

The emotional beats are earnest and feel genuine — most of the characterization is flat, so it's hard to find an emotional in with the characters.

Overall, I liked it — I didn't find that connection that could excite me, but I was engaged for most of it.

<b>Java 1942</b>
John Lawrence is a British officer at a POW camp. Because he speaks fluent Japanese, he acts as an intermediary between the guards and the inmates.

Captain Yonoi (Ryuichi Sakamoto) attends a trial in Batavia. The defendant, British Major Jack Celliers (David Bowie), waged guerrilla warfare and seized supplies. The jury decrees the death penalty, but Yonoi requests to question him and determines they should make Celliers a POW at Yonoi's camp.

Celliers invites abuse with his bizarre and forthright behavior. They pretend to kill him at a firing squad before taking him into the camp.

Lawrence recognizes Celliers, having served with him in Libya. Yonoi questions Lawrence about him.

<blockquote><i>He was a soldier's soldier. Why are you so interested in him?</i></blockquote>Yonoi has trouble rectifying his feelings with Celliers's defiant behavior. Celliers breaks out and takes Lawrence with him. When Yonoi catches him, Celliers puts down his weapon.

<blockquote><i>Why do you not fight me? If you defeat me, you will be free.</i></blockquote>The guards approach, ready to shoot Celliers, but Yonoi steps between them. They must punish someone.

The film itself is about the contrasts in how the Japanese and British engaged in warfare during WWII. The Japanese were strict adherents to the bushido code, meaning harakiri abounds for any misdemeanor. Lawrence argues for letting some crimes go unpunished lest the wrong people suffer.

It also looks at fantasy and limerence — how we use others to fill a hole we can't define. In Ôshima's world, queerness is inevitable — prison walls create a lack that seeks annulment and oblivion. Identity does not fix itself but meets the boundaries of experience and folds into it. It is the humanity that emerges from a dehumanizing experience.

Sakamoto and Bowie stand out for several reasons beyond their rock star recognition. Sakamoto has the wildest kabuki makeup that gives him a soft, youthful glow. Bowie is bleach blonde, which further highlights his heterochromia.

Their characters suffer from a past in which they betrayed someone they loved. The way their characters react stems from these unresolved wounds.

The first act is dense and throws attention at several characters. The movie does not invite
you in — it gets to it and lets you find your way. I had a similar experience watching In the Realm of the Senses.

Holy fuck, the Ryuichi Sakamoto score sent immediate chills through my body. The primary theme is incredible.

The influence on <i>Beau Travail</i> is apparent in a few ways. If I'm being honest, I liked its approach more than this movie's.

I don't think everything works for me here. The movie overstays its welcome a bit, and its critique of bushido isn't as layered as the movie seems to think. The flashback is odd, and I'm unsure how I feel about it.

Still, the movie has moments of beauty that stick with me.","criterion channel, criterion, criterion challenge 2024, cc2024, homoerotic for the holidays, queer",2024-04-28

Adam Wingard isn't a good director. Look at him now — he's doing uninspired Godzilla x Kong movies.

The improvised conversations about filmmaking are so dull. I get it: almost everyone involved is a filmmaker. The improv, in general, is shallow filler.

Also, killing your three best actors in the first 30 is unexpected, but it also brings down the caliber of the remaining hour.

Wanda and Ahmed run off to kiss. Kip and Olga strip her and whip her. Jimmy catches it all and tries to ignore it. After he leaves, Ahmed draws a knife and cuts Wanda's shoulder. He drinks blood from the wound.

The memory sends Jimmy on a trip to escape. In Rio, he meets and dates a lounge singer named Rita. But one day, while playing a club, Wanda comes through the door, dressed in furs.

<blockquote><i>I was hypnotized. I wanted to run, but I had to follow her. I was trapped in a whirlpool that kept sucking me in deeper and deeper. Where was I going? Why was this happening to me? Why couldn't I fight it?</i></blockquote>The narration is noir with a West Coast psychedelic vibe. The closest vibe I can think of is <i>Inherent Vice</i>.

Whenever Jimmy chases Wanda, the movie turns to slow motion — that sludgy running from dreams where you can't catch up or escape.

This movie has that hazy feel that I get from a David Lynch movie. Maybe it's the jazz or a woman in trouble. Is it the thin membrane that separates dream logic and reality? Maybe it's the arch eroticism with an anxious edge.

Manfred Mann Chapter Three, his avant jazz group, did the score. It's outstanding and does everything to set the sinister and otherworldly vibes.

An unwed mother abandons her baby in the park in the back of a car. Thieves steal the vehicle. They only find the baby after they make a getaway. They put the baby in the alley and take off. 

The tramp, on his morning promenade, finds the baby. After several failed attempts to pawn it off, he takes it as his own and names him John.

Five years later, the tramp and the kid have a moneymaking scheme. It's not much, but it's living. The mother, now a famous actress, does charity work and unknowingly crosses paths with her child.

This movie is yet another Chaplin I've watched part of over and over. It's fine. As I've said in other reviews, Chaplin movies feel like homework. Here, it has the added annoyance of a child actor and a saccharine-sweet story.

<b>Nevada Desert 1955</b>
At a hydrogen bomb testing site, “I Don’t Want to Set the World On Fire” by The Ink Spots plays as Brian and Peggy strap into their test harnesses. They are twenty feet below ground level in an underground bunker, testing its efficacy during an atomic bomb.

Suddenly, the bomb named Samson explodes — the bloom is so big you can see it from space. Brian and Peggy’s bunker shakes, but they survive. The military declares them as heroes — “the first nuclear family” — and that they are within the normal range of irradiation.

They have a son named David. They measure his rads, and he seems normal. He has a fever and a perfect circle birthmark on his hand. The nurse brings David to his parents for a moment. When she takes David away, Brian and Peggy burst into flames.

<b>Trinidad Beach, California 1989</b>
It’s Sam Kramer’s birthday. It’s also the anniversary of the Hiroshima bomb. He bombs (ha!) an audition for King Lear with his girlfriend, Lisa.

People in Sam’s life keep burning to death. No one is sure why or how. He hears a radio program about spontaneous combustion. Thus begins a path of discovery that will lead Sam to a horrifying discovery.

Like many Tobe Hooper movies, the established world is fascinating and weird. But with stepping through the plot points, it feels effortful and doesn’t quite gel.

Nevertheless, the effects are extreme and terrifying.

Brian Dourif makes a meal of his hot-headed role. When his powers go into effect, it’s brutal! Things burst into flames around him, his birthmark grows, and holes pop open on his body, shooting blood and fire everywhere.

In 2044, Gabrielle is trying to get a better job than checking temperatures of [insert future tech here]. The interviewer finds her a tough sell because, unlike AI, which remains detached from their emotions like good Buddhists, Gabrielle experiences complex emotions.

In 1910, Gabrielle is a renowned pianist and happily married. She owns a doll factory that’s making the switch from porcelain to celluloid. If she’s so happy, why is she thinking about Louis from the gala? Hadn’t they met before?

In 2014, Gabrielle is house-sitting in LA, trying to get a modeling job. Or anything, really. She chats with an internet psychic who tells her about a man “who only has sex in his dreams.” Neighbors are saying they’re seeing someone creeping around the house. But Gabrielle sees nothing.

Gabrielle believes a catastrophic event will define her life, lying in wait for her like a beast. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beast_in_the_Jungle"" rel=""nofollow"">Like a Henry James novella</a>, Gabrielle must learn that fear is the greatest catastrophe to define her life, for to live in it is to miss out on intimacy.

What does intimacy look like? You’ll have to watch the movie and tell me. Because I’m not sure.

This movie is a lot. It lives in that Post-Film “every moment of sincerity requires an irony that distances the audience.” At times, I’m fully on board with it. At others, I’m cringing in my seat.

Still, I’m happy to see a sci-fi movie made for adults in the theater. Also, Léa Seydoux is outstanding — the movie spends most of its time looking at her, and she nails every second.

It’s hard to come to a consensus for a movie that was so many things — it’s silly, it’s heartbreaking, it’s horrifying. That alone is enough for me to like it, even if I’m not on board with all of its messaging.","amc southpoint, queer, edited by women",2024-04-29

Khalid and Salama stand at a small grave marker in a New York cemetery. Born June 6, 2012. Died October 12, 2012. A teddy bear sits on the corner of the marker, soaking up the pouring rain.

Underneath a nearby tree is a woman draped in black, her body and face covered. They step into their cab. Khalid glances around. The woman is nowhere to be seen.

A year later, Salama believes the child’s death was her fault and cannot get over it. The therapist tells her that returning home might help, suggesting that Selema is getting in her way (??).

So she and Khalid move to Ras al-Khaimah, a village Djinn supposedly took over.

Developers financed a high-rise apartment, into which Khalid and Salama moved.

We need to acknowledge that this isn’t Tobe Hooper’s film. Yes, he made it with Abu Dhabi money, but they did not like the final product and redid the movie.

The djinn effect is pretty creepy — it has similar vibes to J-horror ghosts with erratic movement.

The plot feels too familiar and safe to enjoy. It isn’t bad — I just couldn’t find an entry point.

Stack, Ball, and Bulldog arrive at Simms’ Funeral Home to pick up some drugs. Mr. Simms meets them and guides them through the funeral home, detailing how each person died.

Clarence Williams III is outrageous and has a lot of fun with the role. The twist at the end is amusing, but ties in with the last story (see notes below).


<b>Rogue Cop Revelation ****</b>
Office Clarence Smith is on his first night on the job. He follows his white partner to what seems like a routine traffic stop. But two other white cops are there with Martin Ezekiel Moorehouse, a black rights and anti-police corruption activist.

Though Clarence tries to stop it, the cops beat Moorehouse to death and inject him with heroin to make it look like an OD. Strange Fruit by Billy Holiday plays over the scene.

One year later, Clarence is a drunk consumed with guilt. Moorehouse, in a vision, encourages Clarence to bring the white cops to Moorehouse’s grave for the anniversary. Clarence denounces the officers, and they plan to kill Clarence. Until Moorehouse rises from the grave, to exact revenge.

The movie comes out of the gate hard with this brutal story. The story inverts the horror shape by starting with the horror and shifting to catharsis.


<b>Boys Do Get Bruised ****.5</b>
Walter Johnson transfers to a new school. His teacher, Richard Garvey, notices Walter’s bruises. He thinks they’re from a bully, but Walter claims they come from a monster. Walter draws the monster and explains that he can overcome it by destroying its image.

We learn later Walter’s mother, Sissy, knows about the monster and brings it out to punish Walter when she learns Walter has been talking about it at school.

What a star-studded story! Everyone is so good in this, especially David Alan Grier. The whole thing is unsettling, but that finale is top-notch.


<b>KKK Comeuppance ****</b>
A racist senator and former KKK member named Duke Metger runs for governor. He sets up office on a plantation once owned by his slave-owning ancestors. The ancestor, at the end of the Civil War, massacred all of his slaves — the story: a hoodoo witch put slaves’ souls into dolls.

Duke finds dolls in the home and watches in horror as terrible things happen around him. His moment is drawing near.

This story takes the <i>Trilogy of Terror</i> story and reclaims it from its deeply racist origins. The claymation is fun too.


<b>Hard-Core Convert ***</b>
Crazy K is a homicidal killer who uses his gang as an excuse to murder whomever he pleases. He gets in a shootout with his rival, Lil’ Deke. The police intervene. Crazy K is hurt but survives. He serves a life sentence.

Four years later, the prison puts him through an experimental trial that could set him free. To do so, however, Crazy K must equate the violence he showed to black people with the violence that white people have done to black people over the years.

He hires Mr. Simms, suggesting “Black Lives Matter” as the theme.

Keith David brings his flavor to Mr. Simms — not as unhinged as Clarence Williams III, but with more overt malevolence.

<blockquote><i>I don’t see it as racist — just a warm, comforting part of my childhood</i></blockquote>

Audrey and Philip, white siblings, go on a vacation with Philip’s black girlfriend, Zoe. Aubrey and Philip visit the Museum of Negrosity. Audrey tries to buy a golliwog doll for her collection, but the curator, Floyd, refuses for obvious reasons.

So, they break into the museum to steal the doll. However, the doll has an agenda.

This short is a spiritual sequel to “KKK Comeuppance” from the first film, including one doll from the story in the display cases.

The gore is so over-the-top, it’s pretty wild.

Cliff Bettis used to be a pimp but has turned to legitimate business. Three men kidnap and torture Cliff to get his money. He wants to be a benevolent rich person and put the money into magnet schools and whatnot, but one man accidentally beats Cliff to death.

With no lead, they turn to a TV psychic and demand he channel Cliff’s spirit. They might achieve their desires, but not in the desired manner.

<b>Date Night **.5</b>
<blockquote><i>— What in the world is smegma?

Ty and Kahad go out on dates with Carmen and Liz. Ty lied to them about Ty and Kahad being an agent and casting director. After partying for a bit, Ty drugs their drinks and sets up a camera to film having sex with the unconscious girls.

But the girls also lied about their identities.

They play multiple rounds of Cards Against Humanity on screen, and it’s the most upsetting thing in the movie.


<b>The Sacrifice ***</b>

The story switches between 1955 and the present day. In 1955, two white men kidnap Emmett Till, beating and lynching him for speaking to a white girl. In the present day, Emily, a pregnant white woman, keeps having a dream where Emmett tells her he isn’t sure if they deserve a baby.

Her black husband, Henry, is a councilman supporting a Republican gubernatorial candidate. They host a fundraiser at their house, where the candidate talks about taking Mississippi back to its core values. Emily makes an announcement. Emmett has chosen to live, so their baby must die.

Alice was the sole survivor of the Camp Crystal Lake murders. She still has nightmares about the incident and Pamela Voorhees, who was the murderer.

At the end of the previous movie, Pamela’s son, Jason, emerged from the lake and pulled Alice in. Alice woke up in the hospital. The police found her in the lake, but no one noticed a boy around. This fear — that Jason is still out there — haunts her.

Alice wakes up. She hears noises outside, so she grabs a screwdriver. It’s just the cat. Alice opens the fridge. The head of Pamela Voorhees, bloated and sagging, sits on the bottom shelf.

Hands come behind her. They take the screwdriver and drive it into her temple.

Five years later, Paul opens a school for camp counselors at Crystal Lake. Paul tells the legend of Jason Voorhees, his drowning, his mother, and how he still stalks the woods, avenging his mother’s death.

Paul assures them that Jason is dead. If so, who is the man running around with a burlap sack on his head?

<blockquote><i>You’re doomed. You’re all doomed.</i></blockquote>

Thanks, “Crazy Ralph.”

Like <i>Halloween</i>, the series didn’t want to have any explicit continuity. Jason’s presence in the first one was supposed to be a joke. But producers are producers, and they demanded Jason.

I guess it was the right move since Jason is so iconic now. But <i>Halloween III</i> is my favorite <i>Halloween</i>. I can’t help but wonder about what could have been.

When they talk about Giallo influencing slashers, this movie is the prototypical example as it reuses kills from assorted Giallo. Most famous is the spear scene from <i>A Bay of Blood</i>.

There are a few fun cinematography choices — Terry throwing her shirt at the camera when it’s Jason’s POV, the surprise machete to the face.

The third act is where the movie gets fun. Jason in a burlap sack running around like a doof — very Scream-adjacent.

Squadron Leader Peter Carter converses over the radio with June, a radio operator at a USAAF based on the coast of England. His words are poetic quotations, and June cannot understand what he says.

The film uses this setup as a way of looking at PTSD. Peter expected a heroic death but survived. That survival doesn’t feel fair to the others who died. Why should he survive and not them? So, when an operator from the afterlife comes to take Peter back, he appeals.

There, the battered French miraculously rallied their forces at the Marne River, and in a series of unexpected counterattacks, drove the Germans back. The front was stabilized and shortly afterward developed into a continuous line of heavily fortified trenches, zigzagging their way 500 miles from the English Channel to the Swiss frontier.

I didn't realize until the first death that this is a PG-13 horror movie. So, while a ton of money went into the tarot creature CGI, the deaths are almost all off-screen, with maybe a splash of blood to indicate what is happening.

Which is fine! But the script is also pretty sloppy — how they get to the significant beats is almost exclusively someone googling something and then making a choice based on that.

Also, the characters are paper thin, but they try to have so many character beats. I didn't care about anyone.

All of these things individually wouldn't bother me so long as another aspect worked.

I got a couple of spooks — the special effects team did the hermit's lantern well. The others look alright, but they're all so CGI-heavy that it didn't feel grounded.

I think the bones are there for a fun movie, but for whatever reason, the creativity that would make this work wasn't there.","amc southpoint, directed by women, written by women",2024-05-02

We get a recap of the events of the previous movies. When we last saw Jason, we saw Chris kill him, though she had a nightmare that he was still alive and that his mother pulled her into the water.

They take Jason’s body to the morgue. We get that classic troupe of the coroner eating a sandwich over a dead body. Jason miraculously returns to life. He hacksaws the coroner’s head and cuts open the nurse’s chest.

You can tell Tom Savini is back because the kill effects are fucking gnarly and creative. I had to think about how they pulled off a couple because of how well the filmmakers set them up.

We meet the Jarvis family: Trish, her young son Tommy, and their dog, Gordon. They still live by Crystal Lake for some godforsaken reason.

Another batch of teens makes their way, skinny dipping, dancing, and fucking up a storm. This time, however, the film is interested in the relational dynamics at play and gives us characters with specific hangups and secrets.

The film also explores eroticism, and how culture passes down what is sexy to teens. Whether it’s aerobics videos or old stag films, how they objectify women shifts over time, but the subject as an object remains.

Ted, as the one more versed in pornography, appears like the more sexually active one. But when people couple off, he’s left with a black-and-white porno reel he finds in the house. 

Meanwhile, Sarah, the ostensibly virginal one, not only hooks up but has a romantic and genuinely erotic experience with a guy.

Of course, Jason still punishes anyone who has sex because this movie isn’t THAT considerate.

Tommy, played by Corey Feldman, is one of the most honest audience surrogates I’ve seen in horror. He wants a peep at the action. But what he really loves are monsters and special effects. When his sister meets a guy, Tommy takes him to Tommy’s room to show off his legit puppets and masks.

It’s hard to walk into the fourth chapter of a massive series with expectations, but this movie makes the best use of its setup that I’ve seen thus far. It’s not high art but stands out in a sea of slashers.

Marcello rides in a helicopter flying over Rome, carrying a statue of Christ. A group of women sunbathing on the roof wave it down. Marcello asks for their number, but they decline.

At a club, he meets Maddalena. He goes home with her that night. The following morning, Marcello returns home to find his fiancee, Emma, has overdosed. While she's in recovery at the hospital, he calls Maddalena.

And so it goes. The film chooses seven days from Marcello's life as he looks for happiness in Rome. Emma provides stability, but Marcello wants freedom. Rome offers infinite possibilities, but Marcello wants a place to belong.

Marcello, a scandal journalist, desires to transition to writing but lacks clarity. He finds people with talent and passion, hoping they will show him what he is missing. But he does not belong to their lives — they found their place on their terms. And not all of them are as happy as they appear.

Sylvia follows her whims — she howls with the wolves and mews with a kitten she finds and cares for. She sees the Trevi Fountain, and she swims in it.

<blockquote><i>She's right. I've had it all wrong. We've all had it all wrong.</i></blockquote>

Steiner plays the organ with such passion. His life looks stable and happy. 

<blockquote><i>Your life is a refuge —  your children, your wife, your books, your extraordinary friends. I'm wasting my life. I'm not going anywhere.</i></blockquote>

But Steiner warns him against any life that feels chosen or planned.

This dichotomy — the life of the intellectual versus the life of pleasure — stops Marcello from settling. He wants both, but cannot bridge these lives. Like the helicopter whir in the beginning or the beach waves at the end, an unseeable chasm of noise keeps Marcello disconnected.

The film doesn't take sides. It chastises as much as it allures. The audience member decides what appeals to them.

Time passes in strange ways. Marcello loses himself and nights become days. Fellini rejects the neorealist project's use of social conditions to convey estrangement. Marcello, a man with everything, should be happy. But his want isn't physical — it's spiritual.

I feel like I'm only getting part of the meaning. Fellini's message about Rome is vague, as I know nothing about the city and can only rely on the characters' perspectives. Also, it's over 60 years old — the world has changed a lot since then.

The first half of the movie breezes by. The second half, by design, is a slow descent into chaos.

This film is difficult to get into. It took about an hour for me to get a sense of its structure. I'll need to watch this movie again in ten years to get a deeper understanding.","torrent, criterion challenge 2022, cc2022, criterion, 1001 movies, sight and sound",2024-05-03

Tommy runs through the rain in his yellow mackintosh. He stands before the grave of Jason Voorhees. He hears a couple of boys coming, so he goes to hide. The men dig up Jason’s grave, yipping and hollering like they’re digging for gold.

As they pry open the coffin, Jason’s machete-welding hand swings up and stabs one of them in the stomach. Before the other can react, Jason stabs him in the neck. Jason steps out of the grave, hockey mask and all. He sees Tommy in the bushes and approaches him with his machete. Lightning glimmers against the blade as Jason brings it up.

Tommy wakes up in the back of a psychiatric facility transport van. He’s now a teenager. The van takes him to a halfway house for troubled teens called Pinehurst. Neighbors of Pinehurst despise the place, scared of the “crazy kids.” They’re the worst characters in any of the movies thus far.

The movie's theme seems to be “If you think Jason’s crazy, look at everyone else!” 

Joey pesters Vick a bunch, so Vick kills him with an axe. So begins the theoretical murder mystery that the movie tries to set up. Who is killing all these people? Is it Vick? Tommy? The neighbors? Is it Jason, or someone pretending?

You can tell the lack of faith in their special effects. Even when we have a simple throat slit, the camera zooms in to where it happens just below screen.

Almost every woman in the movie shows their boobs at some point. Considering some are only on screen for a minute or two, it’s pretty impressive.

They set up a chainsaw v. machete fight that could have been great but poorly pieced together.

I don’t hate this movie. But it does so little that I can’t say it did anything for me.

<b>Mississippi Delta, 1940s</b>
Henry and Jamie McAllen, two white brothers, dig a grave for their father. While digging, Henry finds a skull with a bullet hole — the grave of a runaway slave. Henry doesn't want to bury their father there, but with the approaching storm, they don't have a choice.

Laura McAllen walks a mud-covered road with her two daughters. She follows behind Henry, her husband, and Jamie, carrying Pappy's coffin to the hole. They have trouble lowering the coffin.

The Jacksons, a family of black sharecroppers, pass by in a wagon. Henry calls out to Hap Jackson for help. Laura warns him not to — an unspoken conflict between the families — but Henry doesn't claim any responsibility for what happened between them.

There was a point where Hap would have helped him freely — when the two families, bound in mud and poverty, needed each other to survive.

The film follows Jamie and Hap's son, Ronsel, as they join WWII, the horrors and joys they experience in Europe, and how it affects their lives when they return home. The two men feel lost until they find one another.

<blockquote><i>— Why are you so nice to me?
</i><i>— You look like you could use it.</i></blockquote>
But before that, we go to when Henry and Laura first met. As a result, we get a mediocre period drama for an hour. Then, the film jolts into focus and becomes an engrossing and beautiful character study.

Mary J. Blige gives an Oscar-acting performance. Rob Morgan and Jason Mitchell are great.

Garrett Hedlund and Jason Clarke have terrible Mississippi accents. Hedlund at least has a character.

<b>Somehow, Jason returned.</b>

Tommy and Allen race down a foggy road to Jason's grave. Tommy still has visions of Jason everywhere he looks. He figures if he digs up Jason and cremates him, it will set his mind at ease.

Allen isn't into any of it as they dig, as Tommy crowbars the coffin open. The body, crawling in worms feeding on its face, lay dormant. Tommy grabs an iron rod from the gate and stabs the corpse repeatedly, leaving it in Jason's chest. He throws the hockey mask into the body as he fetches the gasoline.

Suddenly, a lightning bolt strikes the rod. A surge of energy flows through the corpse. The eyes open. Tommy grabs the rod and pulls it out of Jason's chest. Jason lurches at Tommy.

Tommy douses Jason in gas. He lights a match, but the rain puts it out. Allen hits Jason over the head with a shovel. Jason punches a hole in Allen's stomach. Tommy gets in his car and races away.

Jason dons his hockey mask and looks at the camera. In his pupil, Jason recreates the 007 opening, throwing an axe at the camera.

Gone is the dour levity of <i>A New Beginning</i>, and in comes meta-humor.

The gravedigger who finds Jason's open grave looks at the camera and says,

<blockquote><i>Some people have a strange idea of entertainment.</i></blockquote>The movie also does away with the events of<i> A New Beginning</i>, so Tommy never becomes a serial killer.

This time, we're at Camp Forest Green, and the camp has busloads of kids. Tommy must convince the councilors that Jason is back and get their help in stopping him once and for all.

If the humor was consistent, I might have enjoyed this more. But it's tonally all over the place. Sometimes, it wants to be a Zucker brothers movie — the eight-year-old who falls asleep reading Sartre — and other times, it wants to be a ""real"" horror movie.

Still, this is an improvement from its predecessor and is consistently entertaining, even if it doesn't work for me. It might have the most coherent means of stopping Jason that any of the movies have had thus far.

By treating Jason like a superhuman entity, the filmmakers follow in <i>Halloween's</i> footsteps. As long as they avoid making the movies too lore-heavy, I can get on board.","max, hooptober, hooptober4.0, slasher",2024-05-05

We open with an endless recap that establishes one thing: Jason is unstoppable.

Jason remains chained at Crystal Lake, like an anti-Prometheus, ready to extinguish the human flame.

The calendar reads Friday the 13th. Tina stands outside, hearing her parents fight. Her drunk father beats her mother. Tina runs from the house to the docks. Her father runs after her. She jumps into a boat and rides to the middle of the lake. Her father calls to her from the shore.

“I wish you were dead,” Tina screams. Energy surges from boat to dock through the lake. The dock shakes violently before crumbling around her father, killing him.

Now a teenager, Tina awakes from a nightmare in the car with her mother. Her mother drives her to her old house. Her therapist, Dr. Crews, tries to awaken the latent psychic power within her. He claims it is to help her, but Crews has his schemes.

Tina, after an upsetting session with the doctor, runs to the docks, where her father died years ago. With the same psychic energy, she wishes her father would come back. Instead, the power hits Jason and resurrects him once again.

Meanwhile, some teens are around throwing a surprise birthday party, so Jason will have plenty of folks to kill.

After reading this summary, it feels like the writers have a book of key phrases they could use and stick together. It’s all a vague déjà vu as we retread the same familiar beats.

The one obvious difference is Tina. The filmmakers aimed to subvert final girl stereotypes by including a character who could distinctly combat Jason. I was initially skeptical of the idea, but it at least gives them some novel troupes to exploit.

Like the previous movie, they know their lead would stop Jason if they let their characters run free. So, we have a foil character — the sheriff in the previous movie and the doctor in this one — who keeps our hero from taking care of business. It’s exhausting.

They also make no effort on the relationship dynamics. I don’t understand why anyone does anything except for Robin and Maddie trying to fuck David.

The movie has a couple of kills that work. Jason whipping the girl in the sleeping bag against the tree is ridiculous.

Where it gets interesting is the third act, when it’s Tina v. Jason. Tina has more creative ideas for fighting Jason than Jason has for killing teens. The ending is so wild.

I didn’t expect to like this one! The return to formula, while dull, still helped the movie. By adding Tina, I was into it.

With that, I’m done with <i>Friday the 13th</i> for this month. I’ll get to the rest of them next month.","max, hooptober, hooptober4.0, slasher",2024-05-06

Fifteen-year-old Holly Sargis (Sissy Spacek) moves to Fort Dupree, South Dakota, with her father after her mother dies from pneumonia.

Twenty-five-year-old Kit Carruthers (Martin Sheen) jokes about eating a dead dog he finds on the road. He's a garbage collector, and the dog lay next to the waste bin.

While walking home, Kit spots Holly practicing the baton in her front yard. Kit introduces himself in his best James Dean impersonation. Kit continues to court (groom) Holly, telling her how adult she is and how she's not like other girls her age.

This leads to him taking her virginity, which doesn't feel like a big deal to Holly. Kit suggests crushing their hands with a stone to commemorate the event. When Holly suggests it will hurt, he says, ""That's the point, stupid.""

Holly's father figures out that she's been seeing Kit behind his back, so her father shoots and kills her dog as punishment. Kit sees her father, who tells him to stop hanging around. 

<blockquote><i>Suppose I shot you? How'd that be? Wanna hear what it sounds like?</i></blockquote>

Holly's father runs to call the authorities, but Kit shoots him. Holly runs to her father's body.

<blockquote><i>Hey daddy? It's Holly. Are you going to be okay?</i></blockquote>

Kit leaves Holly to come to grips with her father's death. He makes a recording, claiming that the two are committing suicide after killing her father. He leaves it playing on a loop while he douses the house in gas and lights it on fire. The two go on the run, heading for the badlands of Montana.

The film is a teenage nightmare — freedom from parents and rules, trapped in the endless running away. The way Kit kills — sometimes out of fear, other times at random — is horrifying. How Holly responds — matter-of-fact, unphased — adds a layer of unreality.

<blockquote><i>I gotta stick by Kit. He feels trapped.</i></blockquote>

Sissy Spacek and Martin Sheen are perfect in their disconnection from reality. They feel earnest and vacant — every murder feels, at worst, like losing a game. But as long as they evade the police, the strange dream stays alive.

The film is Terrence Mallick's first, and it already has several of his signatures. Most notably, Sissy Spacek's voice-overs set the tone and convey just how detached Holly is.

<blockquote><i>Where would I be this very moment if Kit had never met me, or killed anybody — this very moment — if my mom had never met my dad — if she'd've never died? And what's the man I'll marry gonna look like? What's he doin' right this minute? Is he thinking about me now, by some coincidence, even though he doesn't know me?</i></blockquote>

The American dream is a violent man who takes what he sees as his, and the Proverbs 31 virtuous wife who quietly keeps the family together. The way to make a mark on the world is to collect trophies of memories otherwise forgotten — keepsakes and half-remembered tragedies.","criterion, criterion challenge 2022, cc2022, 1001 movies, coming-of-age",2024-05-06

Romulus Ledbetter sits on a piano bench, his back to the piano. As he looks up, the scene changes — he is outside in the snow, yelling at a social service agent. Romulus believes the man is a secret agent for someone called Stuyvesant. As Romulus storms off, some teens say, ""Later, Caveman.""

He gets a pen from a man named Bob so he can write out some notes on staff paper. In his mind, he is at the piano, surrounded by men with moth wings who play along.

At night, he sleeps in a cave in Central Park. His TV broadcasts messages from Stuyvesant and footage of goings-on in the park.

The following morning, while going out for a pee, he sees a matchbook. Looking up, he sees a frozen man sitting in the tree. He calls his estranged daughter, Lulu, who is a police officer, telling her that it's a murder and that Stuyvesant is behind it. Of course, she doesn't believe him. She and the rest of the police force think it's an accident.

The film follows Romulus as he attempts to prove the death was a murder. When a man confirms the murder, he gives Romulus a name: David Leppenraub, a famous photographer.

Samuel L Jackson's performance as Romulus is broad and unusual. His glossy, distant eyes fill in the gaps of every conversation with his ideas. He bounces with an urgency that aims nowhere until it has something concrete to latch onto. At times, he's heartbreaking. At others, he's comedic in that signature Samuel L. Jackson way.

His wife appears to him as she was when he last saw her. She provides condescending guidance, as well as some lampshades for the audience when we question the reality of a scene.

It's such a strange blend of genres: the brilliant unhoused musician who gets another chance, the Gilliam-esque mentally unwell person tortured by what only he sees, and amateur gumshoe getting in too deep with powers bigger than himself.

It also wants to talk about the relationship between art and suffering. For Romulus, that suffering comes from within. With Leppenraub, he creates images of suffering, real or imagined.

By design, the movie doesn't fit together — it shuffles through troupes in as mixed up way as its protagonist. But I found the film so compelling, not because the plot kept me on the edge of my seat, but because Romulus's path is unpredictable.","amazon prime, anti-criterion challenge 2024, acc2024, directed by women, edited by women",2024-05-06

Kohei and Naosuke did a stint in prison together. During a jailbreak, they both stayed behind. The film implies that Naosuke ratted out the jailbreakers for a plea bargain.

Later, on the outside, an old friend of Kohei, Yomoshichi, recognizes Kohei and invites him to his home. Kohei confides in Yomoshichi, telling Yomoshichi that he needs to find a woman he loves from before his time in prison.

Osode, Yomoshichi's wife, returns, and Kohei calls her Oiwa, the woman he has been seeking. But Osode confirms she is Oiwa's twin sister. She tells Kohei that Oiwa lives in Yotsuya and that she is married to a samurai named Iemon Tamiya.

We cut to Tamiya, fighting off a group of ruffians and protecting Ouma, the young daughter of a rice merchant. A man informs Tamiya that his wife, Oiwa, suffered a miscarriage from a fall.

Tamiya reminisces over his courtship with and marriage to Oiwa. He resents his marriage and the poverty they face. Without a master, he has no consistent income.

Osode tells Oiwa that Kohei is looking for her. Oiwa considers him merely a customer from her past teahouse job. Osode warns her that Kohei may snoop around, but Oiwa is faithful to her husband.

Meanwhile, Naosuke plans for Ouma and Tamiya to meet. He hides his desire for Tamiya and Ouma's marriage to benefit Tamiya and gain a share for himself. Despite his initial doubts, Tamiya takes him up on the offer. 

Thus, the pieces are in place. The film follows the familiar trajectory of a Kaidan. Part 1 shows the miserable person making a selfish choice for personal gain.

Kinuyo Tanaka's performance, as both Osode and Oiwa, is outstanding. My heart breaks for Oiwa. Tamiya acts like his choice is for her benefit — that she'll be happy again without him. And she might. Her attachment to Tamiya prevents her from ending their relationship. She has no family outside of him and her sister.

After Tamiya suggests divorce, Oiwa wears makeup and a kimono around the house. She hides her feelings and works harder than before.

I once broke up with a long-term partner to be with someone else, and the pain I caused them is a guilt I still carry. It isn't the same situation, but Oiwa's desperation is too real.

Tamiya isn't heartless. When he realizes how painful a divorce would be for Oiwa, he wants to back out. But Naosuke cares too much about his plan to let Tamiya ruin it.

Now that they are out of the picture, Iemon is free to marry Ouma, the daughter of a rich rice merchant, and receive a stable position from her father.

The film begins with Osode answering the door and opening by itself. Yomoshichi takes a lantern to see who is there. All he sees is the darkness outside.

Osode visits her sister, but a neighbor tells her the house is empty. He heard a rumor that Oiwa ran off with a lover. Osode doesn't believe it.

Meanwhile, Iemon has nightmares, haunted by what happened. Naosuke continues his plot, blackmailing Iemon for a substantial sum of money.

Yomoshichi and Osode ask around and find out that Iemon is marrying Ouma. Something is going on. They're going to find out what.

I wasn't planning on watching Part II so soon after Part I, but I could tell I would lose the plot and the emotional resonance if I waited. Also, after the recap at the beginning, this movie is an hour long.

The filmmakers did not intend it to be in two parts — it is one continuous story. I've read this was a common practice for pre-war era Japanese studios when the movie was longer than 90 minutes.

Although the beginning was elegant in setting up the downfall, this feels slightly messy. I still like how it all happens — it's just that the movie has several plotlines to address.

Still, the ending hits.","criterion channel, kaidan, frightfest guide to ghost movies, j-horror",2024-05-07

Grew a girl with hay shoes

Didn’t know at her father’s home
When she went to her bridegroom’s house,
That she was born a witch
An evil spirit grew in her stomach.
Sacrificed at the altar of Kermikka
a white reindeer doe
From there, she ran as a mountain reindeer
Until the moment was at hand
A lightning impales the white
They lay the girl with the hay shoes
The snow blanket as her cover
And a pillow made of snow under her head</i></blockquote>

Pirita participates in the annual reindeer competitions. During the competition, she falls off her sleigh. Aslak helps her and the two tumble into the snow. They return together in a single sleigh. Later, they marry.

Aslak is a reindeer herder, sending him away for work. When he comes home, work has exhausted him, stifling their once-passionate relationship. He’ll then leave and Pirita is lonely again. She cares for a small white reindeer in his absence.

Pirita visits Tsalkku-Nilla, the local shaman. She offers him bread, cheese, and alcohol as payment. He prepares a love potion for her, reciting a spell over it. He instructs her to kill the first living creature she encounters. During the spell, Pirita displays an unusual power that neither understands.

When she returns home, the first living thing she sees is her husband and the white reindeer. She reluctantly takes it to the sacred reindeer graveyard, draws a blade, and kills the white reindeer. The wind picks up, and she passes out.

When she awakes, she finds the other herders. She camps with them while waiting for Aslak to return. But as the sun sets, she awakens. She leaps outwards and lands as a white reindeer. Not an ordinary reindeer, but one that craves human blood.

This movie is so beautiful! Finland’s snow-white terrain, the trees bent over and burdened by snow, the reindeer roaming the country. The reindeer herders wear skis to traverse cross-country, the reindeer chain stretching behind them — the ocean of antlers undulating and shifting.

The close-ups have sharp, dramatic lighting to tell us the internal state of the characters.

Like other folk horror, this film doesn’t embody the typical horror style or ambiance. It feels like a nature documentary sometimes. The moments when the vampire reindeer strikes feel like being lost.

Mirjami Kuosmanen has such a strange energy to her. I saw another review comparing her to Barbara Steele, and I would say that's accurate. She also reminds me of Debbie Harry of Blondie.

Like <i>Call Me By Your Name</i>, the film suggests that what you are seeing is horny — the cuts, the music, the pacing — but the thing itself is artfully sexless. Sometimes, smoke doesn't signal fire but mirrors.

The movie has several moments where my eyes glaze over while waiting for the movie to move. The constant slow motion worked (to a degree) in the finale, but it did way less in the rest of the film.

There's one good tennis match in the movie: the last one. Still, the filmmakers used so many different fucking stylistic shots. I had to remind myself I was enjoying the film because they'd do another one, and I would roll my eyes.

Dr. Pablo Morales is a taxidermist. His shop window displays a remarkable assortment of animals — buffalo, jaguar, and whatnot — and posed skeletons of various creatures.

Above the shop is the apartment that Pablo shares with his wife, Gloria. Gloria confides in a visiting priest that her husband makes her miserable — he doesn't want children, gets drunk, and wants to have sex with her. The house smells of dead animals. Worst of all, he doesn't share her devout faith. The priest reminds her that her suffering will purify her.

Pablo goes upstairs to find Meche, the housemaid, crying because of Gloria's cruelty. Pablo attends to Gloria, offering her an aspirin. She reprimands him, stating that only God can give or relieve pain. Gloria suffers from a crippling injury that causes her constant pain.

As time goes on, we learn Pablo does none of the things that Gloria says, other than smelling like animals and believing in science over religion. She continues to hurt Pablo and to convince their friends and family that he is an abusive monster.

But everyone has a limit.

Good lord, Amparo Rivelles does such a tremendous job of making Gloria deplorable. I don't know of any person who would be as cruel as her, but it works for the story. The audience ends up hating Gloria more than Pablo ever could.

The movie is darkly comic — one of my favorite scenes is when Gloria leaves, and Pablo sneaks to the kitchen to Meche. It suggests they might cheat, but his secret desire is to have a big steak.

The movie's pacing isn't great, and historical sexism is inevitable and disappointing, but the film is consistently entertaining.

Hidetora Ichimonji hunts wild boar with his sons — Taro, Jiro, and Saburo — and Fujiya and Ayabe, noblemen of other houses. As they sit at an encampment to celebrate, Hidetora suggests he is getting old. While the jester, Kyoami, entertains them, Hidetora drifts to sleep. Saburo cuts some limbs to plant near their father for shade while he sleeps.

Hidetora runs out of the tent in fright. He had a dream he was in a strange land, all alone. Taro's voice pulled him back. The dream motivates him to cede the First Castle and his position as head of the Ichimonjis to the eldest son, Taro. Jiro and Saburo receive the Second and Third Castles but are supposed to support Taro.

Saburo calls the plan absurd, insulting his father's senility. He knows the brothers will not work together in harmony. Jiro and Taro give him every opportunity to take it back, but Saburo only pushes harder. So, Hidetora exiles Saburo. When Tango, Hidetora's servant, defends Saburo, Hidetora also exiles him.

Fujiya and Ayabe follow Saburo and offer him a marriage to his family. Tango declines to participate, claiming fidelity to Hidetora.

Toro's wife, Lady Kaede, faces resistance from Hidetora's concubines as she demands they bow to her. She is not content to only have a portion of the kingdom. The Ichimonji's murdered her family before Toro took her as his wife. So, she encourages him not to settle for co-ruling with his brothers and to take his father's place.

The battle to be Daddy's number-one warlord begins!

Hidetora is a warlord — his rule did not come by negotiation but by bloodshed. Why would he think his sons would behave any differently? 

The colors are beautiful and vibrant. The costumes are also elegant and stand out against the landscape. They help to distinguish the characters in the several wide shots where faces are not easily visible. Most of the film is wide-angle long-shots.

The location shots are breathtaking. Truly! The rolling hills, the elaborate castles, and the scale at which the filmmakers shot everything set the tone of men trying to play gods of their corner of the world. Several scenes feel like classical woodblock prints in color and composition.

The movie uses the billowing of clouds to indicate the passage of time.

The story errs closer to the source material, King Lear, than to historical accuracy in Japan. For example, feudal Japan did not have jesters as Kyoami depicted — he is the Fool from the Shakespeare play. Still, the film takes plenty of liberties with the story, and more so with the characterization. King Lear in the play is pretty much a fool but otherwise just, whereas Hidetora is a violent and cruel leader, suggesting more karmic retribution than a fatal accident.

Like several historical Japanese films, the acting performances have nods to Noe theater. Hidetora is melodramatic, and his makeup skews expressionistic. It's a bold as fuck choice, but I like how it further emphasizes the change in hand from the old reign to the new. 

It also echoes Kurosawa's feelings, himself being the Hidetora who felt washed up in the 80s. He attempted suicide after the failure of his previous movie, and the up-and-coming Japanese directors considered him a has-been. 

Lady Kaede is so unhinged. I love her. I should talk to my therapist about that.

The violence in the war scenes is brutal! Ishiro Honda served as Second Unit Director and his ability to capture carnage translates well to the battles. I can see a few shots that influenced <i>Saving Private Ryan</i>'s opening shot.

It took me an hour to get into this, but once the pieces were in place and the carnage began, I felt like I was watching something special.

Depending on your feelings about <i>Dreams</i>, this may be Kurosawa's last masterpiece. This may be a war movie, but it is a weird and brilliant rendition of this story that only someone like Kurosawa would try. You might consider Shakespeare a safe move, but this movie is anything but.","amazon prime, criterion, criterion challenge 2022, cc2022, samurai, 1001 movies, sight and sound",2024-05-09

Claude Marchand is a reporter for Holiday magazine. After landing in Paris, he receives an unexpected change of plans — he is to interview and photograph the blind sculptor Franz Badulescu, who lives in Spain.

In Spain, a trench-coated figure snoops around the beach. He draws piano wire from his pocket and strangles Majo, a man who tended to the umbrellas on the beach.

Through his contacts in Spain, Claude meets Valerie, a model for Franz. She takes him to see the artist. There, she meets Franz’s wife, Tania. She is the one who made Franz world famous.

Through interviewing Franz, we learn Franz used animal skeletons in his prior work as armatures. Now, for his human sculptures, does he use human skeletons?

Later, we see Tania’s nightmares, in which a woman whips her as a child. Then, we see Franz’s face melting off of his skull. We learn of Tania’s lair, kept secret from Franz, where she has a cauldron of chemicals. There, she strips the flesh from bones.

The trench-coated man enters the secret entrance, and they embrace.

I extensively noted the plot of this movie. The movie is mostly filler. Why did Claude redirect from Paris to Spain right after landing? We also visit several bars, watch parties and dances, learn about a bondage subplot that goes nowhere, and on and on.

The movie makes Batman-like stylistic jumps — slow-motion, cut frames, psychedelic flashes of color and lightning — it feels like it’s trying to amp up the otherwise meh story, but it feels erratic.

My favorite thing in movies about artists is when they show the art, and it sucks. Valerie paints “realistic portraits,” which Claude declares out of style — they are barely recognizable as human. Franz’s sculptures are fine, but I can’t remember what a single one looks like. Tania’s harp playing is almost melodic despite the instrument being out of tune.

I probably rated this higher than it deserves, but it’s such an oddity to watch that I couldn’t deny being entertained.","tubi, hooptober, hooptober4.0",2024-05-10

<blockquote><i>You are just a lifeless ghost. Your kingdom isn’t real!</i></blockquote>

Cut to Anna and Françoise, driving through Auvergne to jaunty Bossa nova. They are on holiday from school. Anna talks about drawing comics once she gets out of art school. Françoise discusses fatalistic philosophy. When they switch off driving, Anna draws a comic of Françoise running through the woods.

They stop at a small pub, bringing the regulars to silence. They order some mulled wine and coffee. The server suggests they finish their drinks quickly and not drive through town. They oblige and take the back roads.

Night falls. The radio loses signal. Anna recognizes part of the road. They’ve been driving in a circle. They run out of gas.

They find a barn. They lay out their furs and share some food, optimistic about the next day. Before Françoise can fall asleep, Anna strokes her face and makes a move. Just like two friends, they make out.

When Françoise wakes up the following morning, Anna is gone. Gurth finds Françoise and promises to lead her to Anna. Françoise follows Gurth into the woods. Françoise spots a castle on a cliff near a lake. When she looks back, Gurth is gone. Two torches burn beside the lake, and a boat waits to take Françoise to the other side. As if by magic, the ship moves on its own accord.

Women in pastel cloaks stand along the rocky shore. Inside, she meets Morgana Le Fay, who draws her into her surreal world of dreams and nightmares. Morgana offers Françoise an eternity of immortality and beauty or cast out among the other rejected older women.

The movie has a soft, slow pace. It chases a vibe far more than a concrete plot. The film has a plot, but it doesn’t race through it.

Several actors have the same dyed red hair, so I had difficulty differentiating some of them.

Wong Chi-ming and his partner sit together, smoking cigarettes. Though they have worked together for several years, this is the first time they've sat together. The film rewinds to earlier.

The unnamed partner cleans a rundown apartment near the train tracks. She leaves a message in the fax machine and does her makeup before leaving. Later, Wong arrives at the same apartment. He relaxes with a cigarette and television.

This is the nature of their relationship — she passes messages along (notes and faxes) and tends to his home needs (cleaning, grocery shopping, etc) when he is out. 

Wong likes being an assassin. He never makes any choices — he receives his instructions and follows them. But having no one to care for and no family to speak of is a lonely life.

Over time, she becomes infatuated with him. She goes through his trash to create a portrait of the otherwise elusive figure who dominates her life. She goes to a bar he frequents, then goes home and has sex with the idea of him.

After one too many close calls, Wong quits the hitman business. He wants to tell his partner but is too scared to meet her. So, he leaves a coin and a song on the jukebox.

The sister film to <i>Chunking Express</i>, this movie sets itself up for comparison — overlapping locations and actors, but shot more at night and with wide angles. Both explore alienation in city life, but this movie ventures into darker territory and chases more emotional levity. Still, the bouncing wildness of <i>Chunking</i> permeates both.

Wong Kar-wai's Hong Kong is soaked permanently in neon green, with a few moments of black and white. No one knows anyone, but everyone has ""friends."" For the partner, they are contacts. For Wong, they are old classmates selling insurance or women who mistake him for an old lover.

The camera is as restless as the city, never content to idly observe — it shakes, tilts, fisheyes, and slows.

The murders are bloody messes — it's never a clean in-and-out, but a massacre that leaves survivors, young and old, reeling.

The unnamed partner is frustrating for a couple of reasons. For one, it makes writing this review more cumbersome. Also, it reduces her to someone who only exists in Wong's shadow. That's the point, but that doesn't mean I must like it.

It also reflects why <i>Chunking Express</i> works in a way that this movie doesn't. This film does not care about the emotional state of its characters beyond the alienation and the love story. It feels like a B-side.

Still, Wong Kar-wai's B-sides are captivating pieces of film with plenty to enjoy.","criterion channel, criterion, criterion challenge 2022, cc2022, village voice",2024-05-11

The camera pans over the Grecian ruins as triumphant music. It lingers at statues of heads and bodies in dramatic light as smoke billows around them.

One statue transitions to a nude man tossing a discus. The dramatic clouds and vibrant lighting cut the light along the muscular form. Nude women stretch and flow in gymnastic rhythms. Muscles tense and release, black monoliths carving shadow into the bright skies.

In the Aryan myth, this is their heritage — the ideal they wish to return to.

A solitary figure carries a torch through fields and beaches, along mountainsides, and into a town. As he passes the torch onto the next, townspeople line the street. We fly across the world, the flags of participating countries fluttering as we pass their homeland.

As we enter Germany, the Nazi flag overwhelms the screen. A bell with the Nazi eagle perched on the Olympic rings tolls. Swaths of the crowd heil Hitler. 

As other countries make their entrance, some smile nonchalantly — others gaze in fascination at the heiling crowd and Hitler. The other countries of the Third Reich also heil the crowd. Hitler declares the opening of the ceremonies.

The torchbearer enters the coliseum. The crowd goes silent. Only the bell tolls as he lights the Olympic flame.

What follows is an epic portrait of German and Nazi inadequacy. Leni Riefenstahl captures the games in stylistic flourishes that contemporary Olympic game footage echoes. Most prominently, she captures Jesse Owens — an obvious and embarrassing refutation to the Aryan claim to genetic superiority.

Look, I can appreciate sports, but I don't like them. The Olympic games are the most boring sports in the world. So, once we move beyond the opening ceremonies, I have difficulty focusing. I like glistening muscular bodies and thinking about how much fucking went on behind the scenes — maybe they should have filmed that?

Much of the initial acclaim this movie received came before the world knew about Kristallnacht. Still, if film history has taught us anything, it's that shitty people can make beautiful movies about shitty things.

<blockquote><i>Sadism, Nazism, is there any point anymore?</i></blockquote>Lucio Fulci sits at his desk, writing out a murder scene for a movie script — faces cleaved in half, women strangled and hanged, someone chopped to bits by a chainsaw, and whatnot.

Lester Parson cooks himself a steak cut from the leg of a woman and watches a video of the drugged-out woman confessing her love for him. Afterwards, he breaks her down and grinds her into meat for his pigs

Fulci calls cut on the horrifying scene from his latest flick, <i>Touch of Death</i>. They break for lunch, and Fulci goes to his regular restaurant. He chastises himself for smoking. The waiter offers him a steak but flashes back to the movie and declines.

These interferences continue in his life, where everyday occurrences bring disturbing images to his mind. So, he sees a psychiatrist named Egon Schwartz. Schwartz offers to help him differentiate between the film works and reality through hypnosis. When Schwartz has Fulci under, he reveals his true intentions.

Meanwhile, the studio wants to make a documentary about Fulci and his filmmaking style.

This meta-narrative is, on paper, a revelatory approach to horror, predating <i>Adaptation</i> by 12 years. And yet, when we get into the meat of it, there isn't much here.

The film repurposes footage from other Fulci films for the goriest details, leaving this movie as connective weaving between those scenes. Most horror that happens outside of the movie is off-screen or suggested, with a few exceptions.

In some ways, that fits well with the blending of reality and film. If Fulci wanted to get clever with it, he could have re-filmed some of the kills so that it bleeds into reality better. But that would require money, and they made this movie as cheaply as possible.

That doesn't mean there aren't some disgusting scenes. Good lord, some of those kills are relentless and nauseating. Which is impressive, because they don't look realistic!

The hypnosis scenes threaten to unveil something honest about Fulci, but he is not interested in any introspection.

<blockquote><i>I make horror films. If I made love films, no one would buy a ticket!</i></blockquote>This revelation (or lack thereof) may disappoint some, but I don't care why Fulci makes the movies he does. What annoys me is how this movie is a clip show. If I had seen these Fulci movies, I would have been bored to death. But I haven't, so I was able to enjoy some of it.

On the outskirts of a small town, children follow after Detective Park Doo-man, who rides in the back of an old car. The driver takes Park to the tied-up corpse of a woman rape victim in the water runoff drain. Park conducts interviews and collects testimonies, asking weird questions like if they thought the woman was hot. He believes that, by staring at their photos, he will be able to intuit who did it.

It happens again with another body, also raped and murdered, left in a remote field. A tractor drives over a footprint. The forensics team slips around, creating a mess. They collect evidence carelessly, allowing reporters to trample all over the crime scene.

Park visits a sex worker, who gives him a rumor about a boy with learning disabilities who followed one of the victims around. Park collects the boy, Baek Kwang-ho, and takes him to a back room.

A detective from Seoul named Seo Tae-yoon comes to assist in the investigation. Seo rides along with Park, who takes Baek's shoes and shoves them in the mud where a footprint once was and photographs it as evidence. Park shows the photo to Baek and threatens him until he gets a confession out of Baek. 

Meanwhile, Seo looks at the evidence to find a pattern in the killings. He calls Park's methods into question, but not with any urgency. Will the two be able to work together and solve the murder?

The film follows the investigation — the ineptness, the corruption, and the desperation. Based on South Korea's first serial killer case, the film captures just how unprepared the police were for a case like this.
<blockquote><i>Even after a thorough investigation, nothing</i></blockquote>Bong Joon-ho is a director whom I have never connected with the way others have. I enjoyed Parasite, but it didn't feel like the brilliant dissection of class that others claimed. Similarly, this does not feel like the incisive look at police corruption I've heard.

Part of my disconnect likely is not knowing Korean culture or history. But I'm also not as huge on <i>Se7en</i> or <i>Zodiac</i>, which are aesthetically and thematically similar to this movie.

Boon Joon-ho said in interviews that he wanted to solve the murder since it was unsolved when the movie came out and that his method was not too dissimilar from Park's — looking at photos for a sign. 

This movie is well made — it's grim, sometimes engaging, and darkly funny. But it overstays its welcome without delving into its subject with sufficient curiosity.","tubi, criterion, criterion challenge 2022, cc2022",2024-05-12

<blockquote><i>Chung Chun-Tao, known as Ah Tao, was born in Taishan and adopted as an infant. Her adoptive father died under the Japanese occupation. Her adoptive mother sent Ah Tao to work as a servant for the Leung family. She has served four generations of the family over a span of 60 years.</i></blockquote>

Roger Leung reflects on his life as he boards a train.

<blockquote><i>Ah Tao was already with my family when I was born. At 20, I went to college in the States. At 30, I came back to Hong Kong and since then, Ah Tao has been with me. That is, until two years ago…</i></blockquote>

Roger is a film producer who travels for work. When he returns home, Ah Tao cooks decadent meals for him — not for his tastes, but for the fussy ones she has passed down to Roger.

One day, Roger returns home, ringing the bell. But A Tao doesn’t answer. He enters to find her on the floor. He calls an ambulance. With Ah Tao in the hospital, he reads the instruction manuals for the stovetop and washing machine.

While at the hospital, Roger learns that Ah Tao had a stroke and will need rehabilitation. Ah Tao opts out, wishing to retire. Roger finds a place run by an old friend who will give him a discount.

Ah Tao tries to adjust to life among people who are far less capable than her, as well as food less enjoyable than her home cooking. When Roger visits, he claims to be her godson (in real life, Deanie Ip is, in fact, Andy Lau’s godmother). The two grow closer and their dynamic deepens as they learn to see the entire person before them.

I love Deanie Ip in this. Her performance doesn’t feel like acting — she has a naturalism to every emotion I can’t recall seeing in another actor.

Andy Lau is charming. Watching his transformation is delightful. He and Deanie Ip have acted so much together that their on-screen chemistry feels effortless.

The film is a slice-of-life, uninterested in drama or big speeches. It has a grim sense of humor when observing the disassociation and frustration at the end of life. Having someone watch over you can make all the difference between misery and joy.

The film is full of cameos from famous Chinese film stars and producers. I recognized Sammo Hung and Tsui Hark, just because I’ve looked them up. 

If I had one complaint, it would be the length. The story deserves a relaxed pace, especially when it's about developing relationships. However, I am particular about film length, so this might not pose an issue for you.

This film beautifully showcases the profound impact of a simple life.","anti-criterion challenge 2024, acc2024, directed by women, written by women",2024-05-13

Scott and Louise lay in his brother Charlie’s boat, enjoying the sun. They joke together, still in love after six years of marriage. She goes inside to fetch a beer for Scott. A strange mist erupts over the horizon, taking over the ship and covering Scott. After it passes, Louise comes out to help him dry off, confused by what happened.

Six months later, Louise leaves a bowl of milk out for Butch, the cat. She grabs a couple of ice-cold glasses of orange juice for dinner. Scott is getting dressed upstairs. But something is wrong — did Louise grab the wrong pants from the cleaner? The pants are loose and the cuffs dragging on the floor. Louise ascribes it to weight loss. However, his shirt is oversized.

Scott goes to the doctor. Five foot eleven. Except Scott has been six foot one since he was 17. “People don’t get shorter,” says the doctor.

One week later, he’s lost four pounds. Louise kisses him. She doesn’t have to get on her toes to do it anymore.

He visits the doctor for an X-ray. They confirm it — Scott is shrinking. The doctor recommends Scott to a medical research institute. They find a chemical in his blood that doesn’t belong. The cells in his body are restructuring themselves.

Scott tells Louise she is free to leave him. Louise loves him, though, and promises to stick by him as long as he has his wedding ring on. As she says it, the ring slips from his finger.

The film follows Scott’s transformation and how it changes his life. The world around him changes along with him — the innocuous becomes dangerous. Will the doctors be able to stop or reverse the shrinking before it’s too late?

This script is one of Richard Matheson’s earliest screenplays based on his novel. Though the conceit controls the story, the story cares about Scott and the personal repercussions of his change.

Notably, no morals about technology or society are present.

The special effects are simple but effective. They build scale sets for his different sizes and use force perspective when possible. They use rear projection or black velvet for the shots where that isn’t possible. The cat scenes were probably the most difficult, considering how they had to stage the action. They always use real cats in the scenes, which makes them way better.

This movie may have killed Jack Arnold’s career. His films before, including <i>The Creature from the Black Lagoon</i> and <i>Tarantula</i>, were pretty good. This is likely his peak. After this, the studios wanted similar movies. Hence, we get the catastrophic <i>The Amazing Colossal Man</i>. He ended up going to England to make films.

Overall, this movie is incredibly my shit. It’s not perfect — I could have done without the narration — but it’s 80 minutes and still looks great.

Waldo Trumbull (Vincent Price) and Felix Gillie (Peter Lorre) attend a funeral. After the mourners leave, the two signal to one another. They discard the body from the coffin into the grave, polishing the coffin for future use. They jump on their wagon, reading Hinchley and Trumbull Funeral Homes, and depart.

Cleopatra the cat (Rhubarb) runs around the dingy basement full of oddities and antiques, where Felix shoddily mends shoddy coffins. 

Upstairs, Waldo argues with his wife, Amaryllis (Joyce Jameson). Above the mantel is a hand-stitched sign reading, “Honor, Patience, Tranquility.”

Amaryllis’s father, Amos (Boris Karloff), quietly sips his tea as Amaryllis accuses Waldo of courting her only to take control of Amos’s business. 

The landlord, John F. Black (Basil Rathbone), stops by to collect the overdue rent. Waldo is once again short, so John threatens eviction if Waldo cannot pay it in 24 hours. Waldo and Felix must find more clients. 

At midnight, they meet and go to the extravagant home of a man Waldo met at a pub. Felix demonstrates his lock-picking ability, only to find the door already unlocked. Somehow, despite making a ridiculous amount of noise, they sneak in and kill the wealthy man.

When the family discovers the dead body, Waldo shows up to offer his funeral services.

The film is a mean-spirited comedy — every joke is at someone else’s expense. I like Richard Matheson’s horror scripts, but his humor here is too cruel by a hair for my taste. Still, the movie has a few laughs that got me.

I love this cast. I appreciate their work in <i>Tales of Terror</i> from the previous year, but I’m happy to see them together in one story. Vincent Price delivers acerbic jokes with the cadence of a queen.

The cat in this movie, Orangey, has his credit as “Rhubarb.” He’s the same cat from <i>The Incredible Shrinking Man</i>! He is good at being a little asshole and sleeping on Boris Karloff.

Jacques Tourneur directed several of my favorite horror movies. Here, he works expertly with an AIP budget to match the tone and pacing the script requires.

Charlie Barber lists all the things he loves about his wife, Nichole. Nichole is a former actress who moved to New York to do stage work with Charlie.

Nichole lists all the things she loves about Charlie. They have a son, Henry, to whom Charlie is a wonderful father.

They take their lists to a mediator, who is helping them through their separation and eventual divorce. Nichole is too embarrassed to read her list out loud. She leaves the counseling session.

Nichole is moving to LA to do a TV pilot, taking Henry with her. Charlie is staying in New York to take their play to Broadway.

It starts as a painful but amicable divorce, but when Nichole serves papers to Charlie, the proceedings unravel, and their withheld feelings surface.

<blockquote><i>Just finger me, okay? I'm changing my whole fucking life.</i></blockquote>

I've been dreading watching this movie for a long time. Not because I expected it to suck but because the feelings it could dredge up scared me. Also, the memes suggested this is an ""Oscar yelling"" movie. And it's not, not that. But it's not just that.

The filmmakers color the movie with tiny details that help the story feel lived in — asides said to Henry, observations on filmmaking and television. Noah Baumbach draws from personal experience, but the filmmaking expands beyond autobiography and self-parody, at least to an extent.

The big fight is so tidy. The infamous hole-punch feels performed and unnatural. I understand and appreciate its core, but it arrives as Oscar yelling, which took me out of the movie. 

Also, the music queues were so cloying! Randy Newman makes sense for parts of this script, but not all.

Still, the relationship is well-defined, and I understand why they love each other and can't stand each other. 

The ending got me. Just because it makes no sense to be together doesn't mean you don't love each other. That's real.

Let's talk about the actors:
* Adam Driver is firmly Adam Driver — he's quiet when he needs to be and loud when the script calls for it.
* Scarlett Johansson is brilliant. It's nice to remember how good she is when she isn't in a Marvel or pretending to be a minority.
* Laura Dern is so funny and frustrating.
* Merritt Wever is so funny! She has one scene, and it's my favorite of the movie.
* Wallace Shawn is disgusting. I love him, but his character is the worst.
* Alan Alda is a gem.
* I'm so happy Martha Kelly showed up. She's perfect — her scene was the most awkward of the movie.

I haven't seen many (any?) serious divorce dramas, so I don't have anything to compare this against. I saw the <i>Scenes from a Marriage</i> picture, so I imagine this movie has some reference. The movie weirdly feels like <i>Boyhood</i>, but I can't tell you why.

I like this movie. I wanted to love it, but it didn't feel as effortless as <i>Kicking & Screaming</i> or <i>Frances Ha</i> did to me.","netflix, criterion challenge 2022, cc2022, criterion, good for her, edited by women",2024-05-14

Outside, we see a typical suburban home in a neighborhood. Inside the house are multiple murdered and mutilated people. Walls painted with blood and viscera. No signs of a break-in. All signs point to trying to break out.

An officer calls the sheriff downstairs. They find a partially buried dead woman — no one can ID her.

They take all the bodies to Tilden Morgue, where Austin and Tommy Tilden perform autopsies. Tommy quizzes his son on the cause of death. They look in the head cavity and conclude sub-dermal hematoma.

Austin's girlfriend, Emma, surprises him. She asks to see a body. Austin says no, but Tommy enters and asks her to pick. The bell tied to the corpse's ankle jingles as it comes out of the tray  — an old morgue technique, just in case the body in the tray is still alive.

As they leave, the sheriff brings one more body — the Jane Doe. The sheriff needs a COD tonight. That may prove to be more difficult than they think.

<blockquote><i>Down here, if you can't see it, can't touch it, it doesn't matter.</i></blockquote>I love how little this movie tells you. It's a mystery that you get to watch the coroners solve in real-time. The autopsy conveys the story.

No surprise, this movie is graphic — they are, after all, performing an autopsy. If I had watched this a couple of years ago, I would have turned it off. That said, this isn't gory for the sake of it. It all serves the storytelling.

It's nice to see Brian Cox in something that isn't <i>Succession</i>. It's even nicer to see him in a horror movie.

The director had coroners on set for reference to ensure that they performed the autopsy correctly and that Brian Cox and Emile Hirsch acted as, well, coroners.

The script was on the Hollywood blacklist for ages, considered unfilmable but passed around to everyone. Producer Eric Garcia wasn't a producer, but he liked this idea so much that he reached out to all his connections to make it happen.

Critic Amy Beddows suggests that the movie is feminist. I won't say how and spoil the film — more making a note for myself.

<blockquote><i>— Every woman is naturally inclined to fall.
— But also to achieve holiness.</i></blockquote>Father Józef Suryn prays in his room at an inn. The bells toll — a local custom for travelers lost in the forest to help them find their way back. Father Suryn unpacks a whip and hangs it on the wall.

He steps into the main dining hall to see a man. The man watches the father pray before sitting and unpacking some bread and cutting fragile slices. As more guests exit their rooms, they discuss the convent and the rumors surrounding it — that “the devils prowl among the holy maidens.”

They burned the last priest at the stake. The pyre remnants are still outside. The story is that he, Father Garniec, tempted the nuns into sexual activity. Hence, the church has sent Father Suryn to investigate.

Four priests before Father Suryn have tried to exorcise Mother Joan, to no avail. The exorcisms begin when he learns of the eight demons that possess her. History reminds us that such things are rarely straightforward.

<blockquote><i>There is no truth in this world.</i></blockquote>This film functions as a sequel to <i>The Devils</i>, depicting events after Grandier’s trial and death. Both films are loosely based on the Loudun convent hysteria in 1634.

Characters often address the camera directly, switching between point-of-views in conversation. We can watch their eyes and the intentions beneath them, subconscious or otherwise. Sometimes, they will meet the eyes of a character we haven’t seen yet, holding an uncomfortable gaze.

The camera work has a rigid formalism to it. But it allows the moments of flourish and movement to break through and unsettle the quietness.

The absence of a score is perfect. There is diegetic music, but something on-screen always contradicts the tone of it.

Lucyna Winnicka’s performance as Mother Joan is wild.

Dr. Daniella Upton (Barbara Crampton) looks at a barely recognizable corpse with a weirdo coroner. She then goes to the psych ward to visit Dr. Elizabeth Derby (Heather Graham), who is mumbling to herself about cutting off the head and destroying the body.

When Beth sees Dani, she begs Dani to finish destroying the body. Dani assures her that the person is dead. But Beth isn't convinced. Beth tells Dani the story of how the thing came into her life.

Beth is a practicing psychiatrist. A young man named Asa Waite enters her practice, asking for her help. Asa had an out-of-body experience, and Beth wrote a book about it. Asa claims his father is doing it to him.

Asa's phone rings. He answers and collapses on the floor into a seizure. When he gets up, his whole demeanor has changed. He is callous, flippant, and doesn't want help.

Beth's hot, shitty husband ignores her pleas and tries to fuck her, but he turns into Asa and that gets her motor running.

The film follows Beth as Asa takes over her life.

Heather Graham should do more Barbara Crampton-like roles! She commits to the bit and does some wacky scenes.

Bruce Davidson is so outrageous — like Graham, he knows exactly what movie he's in.

This has the best use of a backup camera I've seen in a movie.

The score reminds me of Charles Band — goofy and over-the-top in the best way.

The setup is solid! I wanted this to go as cuckoo bananas as the films it's paying homage to, but for whatever reason the film plays it safe. At least we get a coroner eating a pastrami sandwich during an autopsy.

<blockquote><i>Can't you understand, silly? War is not for you.</i></blockquote>Ivan, a 12-year-old boy, looks through a spider web. The world around him is serene — trees scatter the landscape and animals nest. He rises in the air and flies over the countryside. When he lands, he sees his mother.

A loud noise awakens him. He steps out of the barn onto a land ravaged during WWII. A rundown windmill lay behind him. Debris covers the countryside. As flares fly into the air, he sneaks through the swamp, under barbed wire, and past a gun turret. He swims across a river.

Cut to Russian soldiers who have detained Ivan. Ivan will only talk to the commander. They bring a lieutenant. Ivan tells him to call headquarters — they'll know what to do. Though reluctant, the lieutenant calls and receives instructions to let Ivan write a report.

The lieutenant gives Ivan a pencil and paper. Using a code based on foliage, Ivan drafts a report. Throughout the film, Ivan has conversations and dreams that tell of his life and all he lost to bring him to this moment. Where he goes from there may not be in his control.

<blockquote><i>It was so stupid how it happened.</i></blockquote>What a debut! So many of Tarkovsky's fixations are present here — dreams and memory, connection to nature, and how one finds identity in a world that doesn't belong to them.

Vadim Yusov's cinematography does a lot of work to help this stand out — his mesmerizing and fluid camera work and constant play with depth of field add to the dream-like qualities of the narrative. This way of seeing becomes more pronounced in <i>Andrei Rublev</i> and <i>Solaris</i>.

The kiss over the ravine is one of the most striking images in movie history. I've seen it a hundred times before, but it brings me close to tears in context. I hate terms like ""visual poetry,"" but it fits here.

Does everyone fall in love with Masha when they watch this?

The film uses art and artifacts — the spoils of war — to talk about absence and loss. An etching of a German writer tells us about the books the Nazis burn. A sick knife tells us about a fallen comrade. A piece of an old mural is all that remains of a church after a bombing. Their lives are burdened by the shadows of a promised future that never came.

Ivan wants to fight in the war as revenge for what it has taken from him. His dreams and memories haunt him — vengeance is the only exorcism he can imagine.

<blockquote><i>Will this be the last war on earth?</i></blockquote>As one of the earliest anti-war movies to come out of Russia's post-Khrushchev thaw, this film feels special. It moves me in ways few (any?) war movies have. I don't love this like later Tarkovsky movies, but it's a phenomenal film.","criterion channel, criterion, criterion challenge 2022, cc2022, coming-of-age, solidarity",2024-05-15

Meanwhile, Penny Appleby arrives in France. Her father's chauffeur, Robert, picks her up from the airport. Her father is away on business, so it will be Penny and her stepmother, Jane, whom Penny hasn't met. Penny hasn't been to her father's house in ten years. Robert accidentally lets slip that her father's doctor, Pierre Gerrard, is always at the house. Penny didn't know he was ill. Strange, then, that, despite his illness, he is away.

Jane cheerfully greets Penny as she arrives at the French Riviera estate. Jane has done everything she can to make the place comfortable for Penny. Penny confides in Jane how Penny's nurse, Maggie, was her only friend after her mother died. After Maggie drowned, Penny came here. Penny mentions to Jane how she didn't know her father was ill. Jane says she is mistaken. Doctor Gerrard and her father only play chess together from time to time.

The veranda door slamming in the wind wakes Penny at night. She slips out of bed and into her wheelchair to latch the door. As she does, she looks outside to see a flickering light in a window of the guest cottage. She goes across the yard, around the pool, and arrives at the door. There, beside the fireplace, sits her father. At his feet is a lit candle. Penny calls out to him. But she sees in his pitch-black eyes — he is dead.

She screams and rolls away. In her haste, the wheel of her chair catches the lip of the pool, and she falls in. When she awakes, Doctor Gerrard stands over her. Jane joins him as she comes to. Penny tells them that her father is dead in the guest cottage. They tell her she must have hallucinated it. When they go to investigate, the place is empty.

We follow Penny as she investigates to learn the truth about her father. Meanwhile, Jane and the doctor cite Penny's history of neurosis as what is motivating her. The truth may be something else altogether.

The film has the standard Hammer dryness, but it has one of the best developing story structures. It teases at several paths the story can take. You'll predict where it goes if you've seen enough of these. It reflects their confidence in the story rather than any significant flaw.

Susan Strasberg is one of the best actors they've worked with. It's a shame she didn't do more with them — I assume they never brought her a script as good as this one.

<blockquote><i>To begin again…</i></blockquote>

A sweaty man watches Arthur Hamilton from a distance. He follows Arthur through Grand Central Station, pushing through the crowd. Just before Arthur boards his train, the main puts a piece of paper in his hand. ""Mr. Hamilton,"" he says and disperses. The train leaves and Arthur watches in confusion as the man leaves.

He glances at the paper. 34 Lafayette Street.

Later that night, he receives a call. ""Art, it's me again. Charlie Evans."" Arthur believes Charlie is dead. But Charlie recounts personal details that no one else could know. Charlie pleads for Arthur to go to the address. ""I'm alive,"" Charlie says. ""More alive than I've been in the past 25 years.""

He sleepwalks through his job at the bank. He then goes to the address given to him — a meat-packing plant. They give Arthur workman's gear and put him in the back of a truck. He arrives at an office where they put him through a labyrinthine process to arrive at their proposition: to fake his death, give him reconstructive surgery, and a new identity. Well, it's more of a demand than a proposition.

<blockquote><i>You understand that it's true — there's nothing anymore.</i></blockquote>

The film sounds like a <i>Twilight Zone</i> episode. The execution is much weirder — it feels like a Charlie Kaufman story, where desire is a prison and fulfillment is a business transaction. What can touch that void when want is a negation — anything but this?

<blockquote><i>He fought so hard for what he had been taught to want. When he got it, he grew more and more confused. The silences grew longer. We never talked about it. We lived our lives in polite, celibate truth.</i></blockquote>

The camera exaggerates and distorts the world around him. It's not psychedelic, but sweaty and delusional, like a nightmare on cold medicine. 

James Wong Howe's handheld cinematography amplifies the instability of the whole arrangement and our lead.

The movie's most significant failure is relying on Rock Hudson to give the required dramatic performance. As a physical specimen, he perfectly encapsulates that 60s ""ideal man."" As an actor, he does little more than look lost.

Movies like <i>Infinity Pool</i> want to be a more transgressive version of this without understanding why this movie was initially transgressive. Yes, the bacchanalian nude partying was shocking for audiences in the 60s. But the real transgression is to suggest that they are just as miserable as the man stuck in a mediocre office job — that environment does not fix the soul.

Overall, the movie is quite good, and I like a lot about it. I don't love it how some folks do, but I appreciate it all the same.","plutotv, hooptober, hooptober4.0, 1001 movies, criterion",2024-05-17

The king lives a perfect life. He has a ""beautiful and virtuous"" wife and a daughter of ""grace and charm."" They also have a donkey that shits jewels — the source of the kingdom's wealth.

One day, the queen becomes ill, and no one can heal her. On her deathbed, she has one request: that the king remarry someone more beautiful than her. The king receives several offers, but the only princess who meets the requirements is his daughter.

The film is a visual treat, filled with odd designs and rich colors. For example, the queen's coffin is a giant tree ornament. Horses are painting the colors of their respective houses (blue, red, orange, and whatnot).

Coffin Joe is back, baby, and he is still obsessed with the continuity of his bloodline. This time, with the help of his assistant Bruno, he'll kidnap six women and put them through horrifying trials. The one who feels no fear will bear his child.

But when given the opportunity, will he take it?

 The ""horror"" is ultimately a Christian fear of an atheist who reproduces. And yet the film's sharpest critique is unintentional — Coffin Joe and the church take the same stand on the value of children's lives over women's, especially when only one can be saved during childbirth.

The movie has some striking and memorable images — people buried alive, covered in spiders and snakes, scarred with acid, and so on.

<b>Cumbria 1348</b>
A young boy named Griffin looks to the sky. The moon gives him visions of men tossing torches and digging into the earth. The church bells ring. Someone jumps from the steeple.

Connor brings news of The Black Death  — far worse than the villagers can imagine.

<blockquote><i>All the churches are empty. And still not satisfied, the evil keeps striding forward with each full moon.</i></blockquote>The village believes their only hope is to place a cross on the steeple of the biggest church in all of Christendom. To do so is to ask god for his protection. 

Griffin has a vision of the pit and it reaching far away from where they are. With few options left, they decide to go down it and see if it will take them to the church.

On the other side, they find a city unlike anything they've seen.

Despite being and looking low-budget, this film is inventive with its imagery to heighten the feel. The beginning scenes are in black and white, while the stuff on the other side is in color. The tunneling imagery is also super cool.

The film uses flash-forwards so we only have to watch the tunnel bits in fragments. It's just smart from a pacing perspective.

Once they get to the other side, it becomes a fish out of water story — one of the 80s most overused tropes. It's not too by the books, but when it goes for humor I was more annoyed than anything. Also, Griffin spends so much of the movie begging people for shit and it's grating.

The film accidentally makes a connection between the black plague and the AIDs epidemic — accidental, because it comes up but the filmmakers didn't do it intentionally.

Despite its charms and visuals, the film is a bit too clunky to love. Still, this film is better than the material suggests.","tubi, birth year challenge, written by women",2024-05-18

<b>Liverpool, 1950s</b>
After the opening credits, the 20th Century Fox fanfare plays as we tilt down a brick wall. The camera shows a sign for Kensington Street and a worn poster before pulling away to the street.

Night rain falls on the ramshackle street. The camera gently pushes in to the tune of Nat King Cole. Our eyes scan the screen, looking for any signs of life. We cut a corner, down an alley.

A boy named Bud calls for his mother, asking if he can go see a film. She tells him to do the laundry.

Bud stares out the window at a shirtless bricklayer, his arching muscles shifting as he moves bricks. The man catches his eye and winks.

Downstairs, Bud’s mother sings “If You Were the Only Girl in the World.”

Bud stands outside the theater, asking for someone to take him in. Finally, finally, the rain subsides.

Bud sits at his desk at school. The lights dim. He looks aside at a passing ship, the sea foam spraying on his face. The thought subsides and the lights return.

The film continues in this woven pattern — a spotlight or key light cuts Bud out from his surroundings. If a narrative emerges, the viewer assembles them from the disparate moments.

The queer identity is a kaleidoscope of influence and subliminal expression. For those of us who grew up in an environment where we weren’t allowed access to our entire selves, we built our identity out of fragments — a slice of memory, a dash of dreams, a morsel of music.

Intrinsic to this form of identity-making is a distancing. You speak a language of your own making, and moments of recognition sparkle like sequins in the brassy brown world. We all speak the language of joy and sorrow, but must patiently listen through the specifics of experience.

Through abstractions and melodrama, the film achieves an indescribable honesty.

A whispering shadow lifts off of Midwich. Dr. Alan Chaffee wakes up to the whispering sound, but Barbara assures him it's nothing. Alan leaves for out-of-town business.

The small town assembles for a school fair. Jill, the school principal, organizes the event. At 10 AM on the dot, the whole town passes out, including the animals. Frank, Jill's husband, coming back from picking up helium, immediately faints when he enters the town limits. He crashes into a truck and dies in the explosion.

The police investigate, as well as Dr. Susan Verner, an epidemiologist for the National Science Foundation. They gather on the outskirts to determine what caused the mass blackout. One officer dons a gas mask. The other officers tie a rope around him. The moment he steps through the invisible barrier, he faints.

At 4 PM, everyone wakes up. Agents in hazmat suits walk the town, measuring for radiation or some indication of what happened. The town mourns those they lost in the incident.

If that weren't enough, ten women in town discover they are pregnant. All of the pregnancies date from the blackout.

The film follows these pregnancies, births, and the strange events that follow.

This movie has a great first act — it's not air-tight, but it's an intriguing premise. Once we see the children ""in action,"" it takes a decidedly goofier direction. It has some standout moments after, but the plotting is tedious and the development is too sparse.

Christopher Reeve is perfect for this role. His charming earnestness is a reassuring guidepost when things get wacky. He has a couple of genuinely touching scenes.

Kirstie Alley is one of the most successful bad actors. She's horrendous in this movie.

Annie (Cate Blanchett) lays out Zener ESP cards — stars, squares, and waves organized in a grid. People in town visit her to receive psychic readings. She has three sons and lost her husband, Ben, a year ago, whom she still mourns. Her oldest, Mike, has been distant since.

Valerie (Hilary Swank) comes in for a reading. Her abusive husband, Donnie (Keanu Reeves), left bruises on her right eye and lip. Annie tells her to leave but Valerie is afraid Donnie will kill her.

The school principal, Wayne (Greg Kinnear) calls Annie in when Mike gets into another fight. Wayne’s fiancee, Jessica (Katie Holmes), comes by for a visit. Jessica jokingly asks Annie to read her fortune and tell Jessica if she and Wayne will live happily ever after. Time slows down. Annie sees shallow water and Jessica’s muddied feet, but tells them they’ll be fine.

Donnie bangs on her door that night, saying Valerie is in trouble. Annie lets him in, but he suggests Annie is conning Valerie. He shows Annie a voodoo doll he made and threatens her.

The next day, Annie has a vision of her grandmother (Rosemary Harris), who warns of a coming storm and shows her a vision of blood, broken glass, and Jessica.

The script follows a script-writing formula with thematic conversations regarding fate versus free will. The competent cinematography and mystical score keep the ride smooth.

A large ensemble cast does fine with the uninspired content. Everyone’s Southern accent is vague enough that it isn’t too grating — except for Keanu Reeves, who’s never been ace at sustaining a consistent accent. Also, could they not find a child actor to play her youngest — someone who doesn’t stare at the camera every time he delivers a line?

In shop class, a senior named Patrick (Ezra Miller) makes fun of the teacher, Mr. Callahan (Tom Savini), by drawing a grease pencil goatee and making Vietnam jokes. When Mr. Callahan enters, he effortlessly puts Patrick in his place, stirring Charlie's sympathy.

At home, Charlie can't talk to his parents (Kate Walsh, Dylan McDermott) because he's afraid that any negative talk will make them think he's having bad thoughts again. His Aunt Helen (Melanie Lynskey) would have understood how he could be happy and sad, but she isn't around.

<b>Paris, 1638</b>
Queen Anne, the wife of King Louis XIII, gives birth to two sons: Louis and Philippe. Louis XIV will become the heir to the throne. On Colbert’s advisement, the king sends Philippe to Gascony, where D’Artagnan will raise him in secret. In exchange, the king allows the people of Gascony to live there tax-free. Fouquet, a cardinal’s messenger, spies on the king’s advisors and blackmails them with knowledge of this second son to swindle his way into a higher position.

Louis XIV ascends to the throne at five years old. He develops a reputation for squandering away the kingdom’s money and oppressive ruling. Fouquet becomes Minister of Finance and aids the king in tyrannical tax policies.

<b>1658</b>
Louis XIV and Foquet watch an execution with delight — the executed person could not pay the demanded taxes. In Gascony, D’Artagnan and his people refuse to pay the taxes, citing their agreement with Louis XIII. Though Fouquet keeps the secret of Philippe, he intends to use the circumstances to hang Philippe before he discovers his royal background.

Meanwhile, Phillipe drinks and fights alongside D’Artagnan and the three musketeers. Fouquet sends soldiers to capture them. Louis learns of a plot to assassinate Louis.

Before Louis can execute Philippe, Colbert points out Philippe’s resemblance to Louis. Louis uses Philippe as a decoy and accidentally ushers in a massive upheaval.

I’m cheating a bit on this Hooptober choice — I’ve seen all of James Whale’s horror movies, so I selected this non-horror movie to watch. That said, the idea of slowly suffocating to death in an iron mask is pretty horrifying!

James Whale, being the queen he was, favored the rhetorical spars over the physical ones. The sword fights have swashbuckling air while mostly being clinking swords together.

The film is full of pomp and pageantry — elaborate costumes and lavish locales. As a result, the movie feels split in two: the romantic decadence and the adventure. The former feels more fully realized.

Louis Hayward is outstanding in playing both Louis and Philippe, making the former slimy and queer-coded and the latter blandly charming. He acts against himself in some split-screen magic.

I tried to find Peter Cushing, but I did not spot him. This was his first role!

<b>Geneva, Switzerland</b>
An ambulance pulls up to the hospital. Two men wheel a man through narrow halls at the International Health Organization. At the US mission, a guard tells the men they're in the wrong area. The man on the stretcher pulls away his sheet to reveal a silenced pistol, which he used to shoot the guard.

The terrorists set up a bomb, but security catches up with them before it detonates. The shootout goes through a lab, taking down another terrorist, and also hitting containers of a yellowish substance. Eklund, the third terrorist, escapes through the window.

One shot terrorist survives the shootout. They put him in a quarantined hospital room, where they monitor his vitals. Whatever was in that lab was a bacterium — a pneumonic plague that leaves yellowish scabs covering his shaking and sweating body.

Eklund sneaks onto a train. Our star-studded cast joins him on the train, each getting an eccentric introduction. Finally, we see our sweating terrorist stowed away in the back.

We eventually learn that some of them carry secrets that could get them in trouble. OJ Simpson shows up as a priest — or is he??? We also get some heroin smuggling and arms dealers.

They plan to quarantine the passengers in a former Nazi concentration camp. One passenger survived that very camp (played by Lee Strasberg) — not tasteless at all! The train must cross an out-of-use bridge called Cassandra Crossing to get there.

Sophia Loren and Richard Harris are exes who blab with each other as though we already know their history. I eventually warmed to them, but it was so jarring at first.

Ava Gardner and Martin Sheen have a thing going. Between this and <i>Tam Lin</i>, I've only seen Ava Gardner hooking up with younger men.

It's so funny watching Eklund on the train sweating and touching everything — he picks up a kid to help them see out the window, and he curls over in pain over the food in the kitchen, sweat splashing on all the food. This is exactly how I would approach a parody.

A riot breaks out as people attack a police station in the Muguet projects — 33 arrests, 13 officers injured, untold civilian injuries. The riot is in response to rampant police violence in the neighborhood. In particular, police had Abdel Ichaha in their custody and beat him to critical condition.

Saïd leaves some graffiti on a police vehicle — ""fuck the police."" He goes to Vinz's and wakes him up. In the bathroom, Vinz does a Travis Bickle routine. 

They go to Hubert's boxing gym only to find it destroyed by the riots. Still, Hubert is hitting the bag.

Vinz recalls the events from the riot, and about Abdel's condition. Saïd doesn't see the point — Hubert ignores the exchange and handles a small drug deal.

The film follows the group as they deal with constant attention from the police. After the group tries to visit Abdel in the hospital, things continue to escalate to a point of no return.

The film takes place in the banlieues, made up predominantly of residents from former French African colonies. These communities are functional apartheids, reflecting France's entrenched racist history.

Our protagonists are all from immigrant families. They represent the invisible majority — the kids born and raised in France but treated like outsiders. Their communities are the ones that experience the most recurrent police brutality.

The riot footage is real, assembled from riots starting in the mid-80s up to the movie. Even during filming, riots continued in the banlieue where they filmed. Director Mathieu Kassovitz attended several of them and started writing the movie after the police murdered Makomé M'Bowolé while he was in police custody.

The stylistic camera work and subjective asides are reminiscent of <i>Do the Right Thing</i>, while the black-and-white photography evokes social realist films. There are more than a few shots that had me thinking ""woah."" The lighting is staggering in the close-ups.

The dialogue effortlessly integrates several positions on the police, violence, and personal responsibility. Is it wrong to riot against injustice? Is it fair to be afraid for your life or your family's? How do you change your world — fight or escape?

Though Vincent Cassel acted in some roles before this, this movie was his breakthrough performance that earned him attention.

Hubert Koundé doesn't get as much attention — he's still best known for this movie — but his performance was the most grounded and kept me invested.

Saïd Taghmaoui has been in several things — I vaguely remember him in <i>Lost</i>. He's great here! 

Vincent London is pretty funny in his small scene as ""a very drunk man.""

Mathieu Kassovitz showcases some incredible filmmaking — as writer, director, and editor, he assembled a film that feels personal and political without sacrificing one for the other.","criterion channel, criterion, criterion challenge 2022, cc2022, coming-of-age, solidarity, claire denis req",2024-05-21

Malita works in a lab on the outskirts of French Guiana when her dog, Briggs, barks a warning. The other dogs join in outside. They run to the door to find Malita's husband, Marcel, and Paul in a boat. When they go inside, Paul reveals how ill Marcel has been. 

Marcel and Malita show Paul what he thinks are toy dogs, but are dogs reduced to 1/6th their original size. Marcel aims to reduce everyone to 1/6th their size and lower their demand on the Earth's limited resources.

Paul tells Malita about his three business associates who framed Paul and put him in prison. After Marcel figures out the solution and passes it to Malita, he dies. Paul helps her complete the work on a woman. Paul must concentrate and she will respond to his will.

Armed with the formula, Paul disguises himself as an elderly lady. Malita assists him in using the formula to create ""toys,"" which he then employs for revenge against the men who harmed him.

The film has a great setup. It takes a little time to weave together the story pieces and get to the actual revenge. Those scenes, and some of the police investigation, have some satisfying tension.

The effects are solid and remind me of <i>The Bride of Frankenstein</i>. I guess this is technically a ""killer toy"" movie, but it's too much of its own weird thing to fall into easy classification.

<blockquote><i>Sweetheart, at first you wrote so often…</i></blockquote>

Chantel Akerman reads letters that her mother sent her from Brussels while Akerman lived in New York City. The film is several long takes of places where Akerman used to take walks. We hear none of Akerman’s response letters, only those her mother sent her.

She captured the footage without sound, adding incidental sound effects after the fact to maintain complete control over the soundscape. The sound effects sometimes overwhelm the written letters — a passing car may roar over the words.

Akerman captured the footage in 1976, three years after she returned to Belgium. Places hold memories, yet they change as time passes - haunts close, people move. The footage is like revisiting an old letter. In a letter, people remain frozen in a moment. You, the recipient, are the city, evolving and disconnecting from that time.

Ivan (John Cusack) and Josh (Tim Robbins), best friends since childhood, have a small fling for Josh's birthday before going to their job as security guards. Ivan surprises Josh at work with a party with strangers as guests. Josh films it from the camera station and edits in real time to Betamax, cutting a sort of music video.

Their on-site boss catches and fires them. The boys hit the bar and ease their woes with beer and RVTV on the tube. Josh claims he could make better videos than what's on TV. Ivan sees a business opportunity, and they form Video Aces, a music video production company.

They ""rent"" a free warehouse from some rich girl who makes art with shotguns and blowtorches. They make commercials and music videos, looking for that big break.

The movie has several fake shows and commercials, such as a commercial for one of those money books, Prosperity Through Exploitation.

The movie isn't funny, but it got better as I got higher. If it's trying to satirize or reference MTV culture, it feels like the filmmakers were adults when MTV debuted. So, their understanding of what the youth want is flawed (hint: it isn't reunion shows of un-famous bands).

But if you can ignore how clever it thinks it is, it becomes mindless eye candy — tons of cameos and some odd music videos. One video is just voyeuristic zoom-ins on women's asses.

<blockquote><i>In the legends of voodoo, the Serpent is the symbol of Earth. The Rainbow is a symbol of Heaven. Between the two, all creatures must live and die. But because he has a soul, man can be trapped in a terrible place where death is only the beginning.</i></blockquote>

<b>Haiti, 1978</b>
At night, a voodoo parade marches through town. A man, wearing a black hat and painted as a skeleton, leads men carrying a coffin. They drop the coffin in front of a French missionary clinic and light it on fire. Peytraud watches. At the clinic, a man named Christophe suddenly dies. The following day, they hold a funeral for him. Peytraud attends. As they place the cover on the coffin and lower it into the earth, Christophe’s eyes open and tears run down his cheeks.

<b>Amazon Basin, 1985</b>
Dr. Dennis Alan is an anthropologist from Harvard, on a botanical expedition. He meets with a shaman called An Hango — “the most powerful spiritual man in the Amazon.” The shaman brews an elixir for Dr. Alan to drink — they won’t let him leave until he does. Dr. Alan drinks the potion and has a vivid hallucination of a leopard. A strong wind blows and he sees Peytraud. Hands emerge from the ground, pulling the screaming doctor down. Through the hole he goes — faces and hands guide him down until the sides disappear and Alan falls into bottomless darkness.

<b>Boston</b>
Dr. Alan gets a call from Earl Schoonbacher, a friend and former professor, now a consultant for a pharmaceutical company called Boston Biocorp. They have a meeting to discuss zombification. A recent photo proves Christophe is still alive in Haiti. Something brought him back to life. Boston Biocorp wants Dr. Alan to determine how.

<b>Haiti</b>
Dr. Alan meets up with Dr. Marielle Duchamp to locate Christophe. Before they do, Captain Peytraud of the Tonton Macoute warns Alan to leave before it’s too late.

<blockquote><i>Don't let them bury me — I'm not dead!</i></blockquote>

The film unfurls into a horny nightmare — symbolic images flood Dr. Alan’s dreams before he encounters them awake. Some of them are pretty horrifying (compliment). The idea of drowning in a coffin filled with blood is solid nightmare fuel. I like the idea that once the zombie powder has affected you, it leaks into your waking life.

Bill Pullman is hot, Cathy Tyson is hot. We get some Pullman pubes.

Brent Jennings, who plays Louis Mozart, is charismatic and brings energy to the movie. Is he always a minor character? I would love to see a film with him in a more prominent role.

The original cut for this movie was 3 hours. It’s clear from the narration and montage. As a result, the film feels a tad shallow. We lost some characterization, but I can’t tell if it would add to the experience. Perhaps what we’re losing is a more explicit or well-defined argument about the director’s feelings about voodoo and how white people appropriate it. Or maybe that was never on the filmmaker’s mind.

Detective Mike Norris chases notorious serial killer Charles Lee Ray through the streets of Chicago. Ray’s accomplice, Eddie, drives off and leaves Ray behind. Wounded by a gunshot, Ray hobbles into Playland Toys to hide. The Good Guy talking doll is displayed prominently on the shelves, a child-sized redhead in overalls, with a ventriloquism dummy mouth. 

Norris gets a solid hit on Ray in the shootout, who stumbles bleeding into the back. In case it isn’t clear, Ray yells aloud to Norris that he is dying.

<blockquote><i>You hear that? I’m going to get you and I’m going to get Eddie, no matter what!</i></blockquote>Ray circles the store and collapses into the stack of Good Guy talking dolls. He pulls one of the dolls out of the box and chants something. A storm brews outside, lightning filling the sky. At the culmination of the chant, a lightning bolt breaks through the skylight, causing a massive explosion. Norris finds Ray’s dead body and the smiling doll next to him.

Cut to the home of six-year-old Andy, who watches a commercial for the Good Guy talking doll — an animated character that promises to be your friend. When his mother, Karen, wakes up, they open presents. He gets some toys, but not the Good Guy talking doll he wants. Karen, a widow barely scraping by, couldn’t afford the expensive toy.

Later, while Karen is at work, her coworker and best friend Maggie informs her of a peddler in the alley selling discounted Good Guy talking dolls. Karen brings the doll home to the elated Andy. The doll introduces itself as Chucky, his friend to the end. 

Maggie watches Andy while Karen works another shift. Chucky displays unusual behavior. For example, when the TV mentions the police capturing Eddie, Chucky ignores Andy to watch the news. Maggie turns off the TV and puts them to bed. Then, the sound of the TV cutting back on startles Maggie. Chucky is in the living room. Maggie assumes Andy is playing with her. But after Andy goes to sleep, she hears funny noises. A hammer hits her in the face, sending her stumbling backward, out of the window, and into a car below.

<blockquote><i>— Do you believe me now?
— Yeah, but who's gonna believe me?</i></blockquote>Thank god Charles Band couldn’t afford to make this movie — I’m sure it would’ve been goofy fun, but the slick budget helps a lot. The special effects are outstanding! They used clever camera tricks, doubles, and radio-controlled puppetry. It still works today.

The film walks a difficult tone line. Some of the subject matter is pretty heavy, especially around Andy’s psychology and the prospect of not only losing his mother but Chucky potentially murdering him. The kid does a swell job — he has an emotional breakdown scene that helps us sympathize with him.

I like Catherine Hicks in this movie. She has to sell some pretty unbelievable behavior, but her character is so on the edge as it is.

Cutting this movie to under ninety minutes keeps the pace fast and fun. I did not expect to like this as much as I did. This is a hugely successful franchise that only gets weirder.

I’m looking forward to checking out the rest!

A picture of Hitler painted on a wall explodes — an Allied bombing raid — exposing Maria Berger and Hermann Braun's wedding at the Civil Registry. They exchange their vows, and windows collapse, and people scramble. While they huddle together, Maria pulls out the forms to sign to make their marriage legally binding.

Hermann returns to the eastern front, and Maria scrambles to make money. She tries to sell her wedding dress, but as her mother says, there are too many women and not enough men right now.

After the war ends and the men return home, Maria searches for Hermann, but he does not return. Still, she holds out hope that he is alive.

In the meantime, Maria must support herself, her mother, and her grandfather. She does her hair and makeup and buys a smuggled dress. Maria goes to her old high school gym, which the Allied troops have converted into an underground bar. There, she applies to do sex work in exchange for cash or goods.

So it will go for Maria — she must seduce and manipulate to find a way forward. The film follows the episodes of her life and the lengths Maria will go to.

Hermann is the ghost on the outskirts of Maria's life. She claims to do it all for him, but how could she?

If one thing has become clear in Fassbinder's movies, it's that he sees himself as an unredeemable piece of shit and likes to focus on similar characters. He was vocal about how much he related to Franz Biberkopf, who was awful to everyone in his life and got what he deserved. But he was also a sympathetic character who the audience cared about.

Here, in a movie made around the same time as <i>Berlin Alexanderplatz</i>, we have Maria Braun. We never see her give an honest go at life, only the time when she lies and fights to live. The value of another life loses its meaning as her ambitions forsake her feelings.

<blockquote><i>It's not a good time for feelings, but that suits me fine.</i></blockquote>The movie has a brisk momentum — everything happens before you can get a hold of it.

Like other Fassbinder movies, melodrama is the lifeblood that keeps the story human — swirling camera and mourning widows, moments of bitter reflection with all-or-nothing conclusions, and sudden musical stings.

It feels a little surreal seeing so many actors from <i>Berlin Alexanderplatz</i>!

Hanna Schygulla exudes something like femme fatale energy, but she never plays the game to full effect. Still, her Maria is unknowable — her secrets live at the edge of the eyes.

For all its eccentricities, the movie isn't as alienating as some of his other movies. It may not be a romping good time, but its story is human. Still, no one's ever made a movie like Fassbinder did — it's magic I hope to understand someday.","criterion channel, criterion, criterion challenge 2022, cc2022, written by women, edited by women, 1001 movies",2024-05-24

<blockquote><i>You can act happy, but your voice will tell the truth</i></blockquote>Ho Po-Wing and Lai Yiu-Fai, two on-again, off-again boys, go on a trip to Argentina to try and start over. But things go from bad to worse, and the relationship becomes abusive. Can they address their jealousy? Can Po-Wing stop fucking other boys?

The two have a toxic dynamic. It's a difficult watch because you want Po-Wing and Yiu-Fai to move on and figure out how to be happy apart, but they keep running back to each other, trying to start new without addressing any of their shit.

But together or apart, they both are lonely people.

For a 90s movie, it's impressive that no one is performing gendered roles or acting out any notable gay stereotypes. Although, look at that raw denim vest.

The story is a little too flat for a good chunk of the movie, but it finds a way to explore different dynamics.

Still, the performances are heartbreaking, and every frame is beautiful. Rich black and white —  mesmerizing color — Christopher Doyle doesn't miss.","criterion channel, criterion, criterion challenge 2022, cc2022, queer, 1001 movies, sight and sound, village voice, golden horse",2024-05-24

Mario and Roberto are two dipshit thieves. After botching yet another job, they meet up with Lina. Lina saw a little girl, Flaurence, whose parents are wealthy car manufacturers. They concoct a plan to kidnap her for ransom money.

Mousier Danville gets the call and races to get her, but he accidentally hits a pedestrian with his car right in front of the cops. The cops arrest Danville.

The crooks call their boss, Pepe, who instructs them to hide out with Antonio in the jungle until things cool off. A woman named Mickey helps them cross the border, but when the car's radiator overheats, she leaves them behind to get water

The palest white dudes I've ever seen, dressed in face paint, wigs, and loincloths, hide in the tall grass. Mickey shoots at them, but they capture her. The others hear the gunshot and drive off without her. The ""tribe"" cuts open Mickey, digs out her insides and goes nuts.

This film is the rare (at the time) French cannibal flick, coming at the tail end of a slew of Italian cannibal movies. It also shares some footage/characters with <i>Mondo Cannibale</i>, a film directed by this film's co-writer, Jess Franco. 

The movie altogether is pretty inept. It has decent pacing until we get to Antonio's.  We don't care if the cannibals get the thieves. But we get some stakes with a little girl in their company.

The gore and viscera are grotesque — they're ripping apart some animal, and the white tribespeople put animal parts in their mouths and gnaw.

The Severin remaster is top-notch, perhaps to the film's detriment — some grain and film scratches might hide the seams a bit better. 

Overall, the film does as little as possible to check off the genre troupes. The only reason this movie received any attention (and why I'm watching it) is because it was on the UK Video Nasties list.

Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) starred in the TV show <i>Bounty Law</i> in the 50s. Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) was his stunt double. Now, in 1969, the two are close friends — Rick mostly does TV villain roles, but Cliff can't find much work after the allegations that he murdered his wife.

Rick's agent, Marvin Schwartz (Al Pacino), advises Rick to look into Spaghetti Westerns. Rick thinks he's above for that shit, even though he's done cheap exploitation that would, by all definitions, be more embarrassing. 

Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) and Roman Polanski (Rafał Zawierucha) return home after a long trip. They live next door to Rick. Sharon talks about a new friend she doesn't think Roman would like.

The film follows Rick and Cliff's journey to the bottom, visiting in on Sharon Tate every now and again to see her feet.

For a three-hour movie, not much happens. It's a lot of ""Remember this song? This ad? This brand of beer?"" Like, 1/2 of the movie is that.

He goes through the exhaustive expense to recreate 1969 LA. But for every old film style he approaches, he goes for expensive over authentic, claiming he wants it to feel like it did in his childhood memories. It's another way of saying he'll do whatever he wants, fuck you very much.

The movie has a lot of hot people being hot. Unrelatedly, I've never seen more foot shots in my life. The way every actress points their bare feet — they received SPECIFIC direction.

DiCaprio has the most emotionally resonant scene in the movie. Him doing a TV pilot with real-life TV actors Timothy Olyphant and Luke Perry is a clever way to signal his decline in status.

I hated how they characterized Bruce Lee. Also, how they handled the Manson family shit is bizarre.

The third act is such a clumsy mess — one scene is disgusting, misguided, and legitimately ruins the entire movie. What's worse is that Tarantino wrote the film in reverse with that scene in mind.

Emanuelle, a photojournalist, sits in a NYC psyche ward, posing as a patient. She has a baby doll on her lap. When the eyes close, a shutter clicks.

Down the hall, a nurse burst out of a room, her smock partially removed and her right breast torn from her body. The orderlies rush in to see a girl haunched in the corner, eating the last remaining breast tissue. As they clumsily force her into a straightjacket, Emanuelle turns the corner and takes a photo.

Later that night, Emanuelle sneaks into the girl’s room. She fingers the girl into submission to get information. She learns that the nurse who lost a breast was abusing the girl — unlike what Emanuelle was doing, with the fingering and whatnot. The girl also has an unusual tattoo just below her belly button. Through some guy at the newspaper, she learns the tattoo is from an Amazonian cannibal tribe.

Her editor puts her in touch with Professor Mark Lester at the American Museum of Natural History, who has made several expeditions to the area and could be of use. The professor brings her back to his place to watch videos of cannibals decapitating men, sawing off their genitals, and eating their eyeballs.

After sex with the professor and a stranger at the docks, Emanuelle is now prepared to embark on her journey to the Amazon in search of a lost cannibal tribe.

This film was on an Italian horror list. All I knew beforehand was that it was a cannibal movie and that <i>Emanuelle</i> was a series. I didn’t realize I was also watching a sexploitation flick. The plot stops repeatedly for softcore sex scenes. It’s so frequent that it’s annoying, bordering on funny.

It’s also disorienting because the gore is quite brutal. We have brief moments of gore throughout, followed by a veritable orgy in the last act.

Overall, this is the purest distillation of pulp I can recall. Joe D’Amato knows exactly what softcore and cannibal audiences want, and blends the two as clumsily as necessary to fit all the troupes. Since I’m not a fangirl of either genre, I can’t say I like this.

A black carriage kidnaps a barmaid on her way home. It brings her to the Karnstein castle, vacant for the past 40 years. There, a woman in a black cloak and a poor imitation of Christopher Lee perform a ritual, draining blood from the barmaid and pouring it over a long-dead corpse. With an incantation to Satan, the body glows and returns to life, once more human.

Meanwhile, the author, Lestrange, is out for some strange, flirting with every barmaid and farm girl he sees. The barkeep warns him that the Karnsteins are to return, as they do every 40 years. Lestrange calls bullshit and goes to the castle.

There, he meets a schoolteacher and three girls from a nearby finishing school. They lead Karstein to the school, where he connives to become the new English teacher. While Karnstein tries to get laid, the audience tries to figure out the mystery of the disappearing girls.

This movie is the second in a loose trilogy. I saw the first one long enough ago that my scant review did not refresh my memory.

I did not know (or perhaps forgot) that Hammer made movies as horny as this one. So many topless women for no particular reason. Women make eye contact with the camera and go in for kisses, skinny dip, and make out with each other.

There is a scene where the song Strange Love plays, and Yutte Stensgaard makes an ahegao face as Michael Johnson kisses somewhere on her person. I laughed.

Despite this, the film succeeds in some Gothic atmosphere. The third act is when everything picks up. The journey there isn't awful, but the film believes the occasional boobs will suffice where the plot lacks.","shudder, hooptober, hooptober4.0, vampires, britsploitation, gothic horror",2024-05-27

Dr. Sarah Bowman sits, head bowed, in a white brick room. Across from her, a calendar with days demarcated by red X's. She approaches the calendar, reminiscing over the October image of people in a pumpkin field. Suddenly, dozens of rotting hands break through the brick wall like paper, reaching toward Dr. Bowman.

She awakens in a helicopter flying over Fort Myers. Private Miguel Salazar prays, kissing a cross around his neck. Bill McDermott continues to try people on the radio but can't get anyone. Dr. Bowman suggests settling down, to which Bill scoffs. But Dr. Bowman is determined to take every chance possible to find survivors. John, the pilot, agrees to land but will take off at the first sign of trouble.

Dr. Bowman and Private Salazar walk the desolated streets. Salazar uses the bullhorn, calling for anyone alive — a vocal sample I recognize from the Gorillaz song M1 A1. Bill continues to broadcast out, but John tells him not to bother. The undead hears the bullhorn and rouse from the static state — missing jaws, eyes, and noses. Soon, a hoard of hundreds convenes in the street. The crew hopelessly boards the helicopter and returns to their base — an underground missing bunker in the Everglades.

Underground, Dr. Logan keeps a collection of undead as test subjects in an underground corral in the compound. He believes he can domesticate them through training. He may be right, as soldiers call out for the undead, and the undead hesitate — they're learning. Still, Dr. Bowman believes they should look to cure the virus.

Miguel's loosening grip on reality nearly causes an undead to kill one of their soldiers. The other soldiers threaten to throw him to the undead for his recklessness. When Dr. Bowman saves him, he slaps her repeatedly for making him look weak.

If all this wasn't enough, Major Cooper died that morning, putting Captain Rhodes in charge. Captain Rhodes opposes the collection of undead, especially as research shows little progress. Rhodes intends to execute anyone who stands in his way.

In this grim power play, the film looks for glimpses of humanity and a unifying cause.

George A. Romero's <i>Dead</i> series launched the zombie craze without ever referring to them as zombies. Here, Romero critiques Reagan's military-industrial complex and the cultural apathy that dominated postmodern discourse.

This film came out in the shadow of two films that owe much to the previous <i>Dead</i> films: <i>Re-Animator</i> and <i>Return of the Living Dead</i>. Compared to those high-octane romps, this film takes a slower, talkier approach.

It also isn't the film that Romero set out to make. He cut a 204-page script down to 122 and still could not receive the funding necessary to make it — Romero's recurring foil throughout his career. The story would sound familiar to Fallout fans — a society attempts to rebuild while the military funds projects to weaponize the undead in service of humanity. But, you know, hubris.

Romero's producers offered him a choice: receive the $7 million and make an R-rated film, or receive half that to produce an X/unrated film. He chose the latter for artistic integrity, but the budget limits only hindered his ability to tell the story he wanted. We still get Tom Savini's spectacular gore effects — his assistant, Greg Nicotero, would serve as the principal effects person on <i>The Walking Dead.</i>

Still, the filmmakers could not realize the scale. With the slashed budget, Romero rewrote the film from scratch, producing the 88-page script we see in this movie. And, as the producers guessed, Savini's effects on the brutal kills led to an X rating.

The resulting film is a dark reflection of Romero's most pessimistic tendencies. The oasis that John and Bill have feels nice but also disconnected from reality. John believed the plague was a curse from god and that none of our knowledge matters — they have opted out and chosen self-preservation.

It's wild how many brilliant actors are here, giving the broadest, loudest performances. With a character-heavy script on a sci-fi concept, the film has trouble getting to the action. But once it gets going, it's fucking gnarly.

I love the score! It has a satisfying blend of emotional and haunting moments.

Bub is the most inspiring aspect of the movie — rediscovering the humanity of who the military reduced to ""the enemy."" The rest of the movie undermines this for the sake of kills, but the kills are the best part of the movie.

Overall, this is a significantly weaker film than the predecessors, helped by moments of humanity and disgusting gore.","shudder, joe bob, hooptober, hooptober4.0, zombies, post-apocalypse",2024-05-28

<blockquote><i>In the olden days, there were many Chinese legends. Some are about spirits and monks, while others are about ghosts and fairies. These legends were popular with all audiences.</i>

<i>One legend occurs in the Song dynasty, maybe in the 11th century. A scholar failed the imperial exam. All he knew how to do was study, but he couldn't find a decent job, so he started working as a copyist. It was a living.</i>

<i>One day he got a letter from a monk at the Ocean Mudra Temple asking him to copy a Buddhist sutra. He wasn't a Buddhist nor did he believe in a spirit world. But then he thought it over and could hardly say no to the money. It was merely another job, after all.</i></blockquote>

Ho stands at a cliff's edge, waves crashing against it. The sun glows golden yellow as it rises. He traverses the mountains. A rainbow greets him on one descent — flowing water, and tender flowers. He makes his way to the Ocean Mudra Temple at Gaya Mountain.

There, a monk advises Ho not to speak as the monk fetches the sutra and prayer beads for him. The master will show him the mudra — he must only listen and follow. Ho enters and bows before the master. The master guides Ho in the mudra before handing off the sutra.

Master Pujing, in the capital, needs the sutra for a ritual to release lost souls who died in the wilderness. Whoever possesses it can navigate the realms of life and death. Some believe that whoever possesses it can control evil.

Ho travels to stay with Tsui Hung-chih, adviser to General Han, during his transcribing. We follow him on his journey as he meets a recurring cast of characters: a standoffish traveler, a Buddhist lama who watches Ho from a distance, and a flutist who appears and disappears in a second. He encounters shadows at a distance who avoid him — restless ghosts or demonic entities from the underworld?

Everyone is welcoming when Ho arrives at Tsui's place, but they all seem to keep secrets from Ho.

The film emphasizes travel and nature — the journey between destinations is as important as the place itself. Every location has a rich atmosphere and personality. The countryside comes to life with walls, pavilions, and temples littering the landscape.

The film is over three hours long. It is content to wander, not aimlessly, but gently forward in the formal structure of an old Chinese legend. Day and night attach to a moment with no obvious consistency. As a result, some viewers will probably find this movie slow or boring.

For me, the vibe was right in my comfort zone of cozy and uncanny — fantastical horror, firmly rooted in the thin membrane between the human and the supernatural.","hooptober, hooptober4.0, wuxia",2024-05-29

<blockquote><i>That which is dead… cannot eternal lie.
With strange eons… even death may die.</i></blockquote>Leslie Doyle moves her and her two children, Jonathan and Jamie, 26 hours into a mortuary, beginning a new job as a mortician. Upon arrival, they see the dilapidated mortuary reeking due to an overflowing sewage tank.

Regardless, the children make the most of it. Jonathan moves into the attic room, with bars on the windows and “Bobby F” carved on the windowsill. Jamie claims to be afraid of dead bodies but is more than eager to become her mom’s assistant.

The mortuary holds many secrets — a star-shaped key, a knee-high metal door leading to (???), and a mysterious black ooze that seems drawn to blood. Once Jonathan gets a job, he learns about Bobby Fowler and the horrifying town legends regarding the mortuary.

What is myth, and what is truth? When some town teens break into a mausoleum, they learn firsthand.

The same writers worked on this and the Toolbox Murders remake. Both movies introduce us to a slew of characters before we have any sense of a plot. Not that I have a problem with it — it just makes writing reviews more difficult.

Toby Hooper never shies away from humor amidst the dread. It’s probably the thing that audiences hate most about his movies. But having a town full of weirdos keeps the movie interesting.

That said, Leslie’s storyline is practically slapstick, but the score only has the “ominous” tone, so we get some disjointed scenes.

The color grading is mostly putrid green and spray-tan orange — peak early-00s aesthetic.

Overall, this feels a little like Texas Chainsaw II. It’s not as fun, but it’s an easy-going romp that asks little of the audience.

<blockquote><i>Almost every capital like New York, Paris, and London hides, behind its wealth, poverty-stricken homes where poorly fed children, deprived of health or school, are doomed to criminality. Society tries to provide a cure. Succes for its efforts remains very limited. The future is not bound to the present: the day will come when children’s rights are respected.</i>

<i>Mexico, a large modern city, is no exception to the rule. This film shows the real life. It’s not optimistic. The solution to this problem is left to the forces of progress.</i></blockquote>

Destitute children play in the streets of Mexico City. A kid pulls out a pack of cigarettes and everyone crowds around him for one. The kid with cigarettes shares El Jaibo out on the streets — he escaped from reformatory prison.

El Jaibo meets up with the other kids and gives them the rundown of prison. When no one has a cigarette or money, he tells them he’s learned some things and will help them make money.

A blind street musician plays for tips. A kid draws a razor blade to cut the man’s bag from him, but the blind man notices and bashes him on the leg with a stick. When the man leaves, the kids tail him to a remote place, where they pelt him with rocks and mud. El Jaibo destroys the man’s instruments as the kids steal the bag and run.

Later that night, Pedro sits at home. When his mother comes home, he asks for food. But she will not feed him until he stops hanging out with the street kids and finds a job to support them. Instead, he goes out and robs a kid who cannot locate his father.

Pedro helps El Jaibo track down Julián, who they believe to be the snitch who got El Jaibo in jail. Julián denies it. El Jaibo wants to fight, but Julián refuses. When Julián turns away to leave, El Jaibo throws a rock at his head. He beats Julián to death and robs him, giving money to Pedro to make him an accomplice.

The film follows Pedro’s descent as he learns who to trust and the cost of this way of life.

Buñuel runs contrary to the social realist conventions of the time. The poverty these people face does not refine their moral character — even the seemingly innocent characters, such as the blind musician, have dark secrets and predatory habits.

Audiences ask about the value of showing this cruelty without hope. The film disputes the belief that impoverished individuals can improve their conditions through a positive attitude. It’s not like life has given these folks opportunities to squander. They have stolen every success in their lives, which are few.

Chicken and egg imagery adds a surreal layer. For example, a chicken witnesses a crime. Later, the same chicken’s owner consoles it, as though the chicken recounted what it witnessed. To be a chicken is not brave enough to take what you can. So, when Pedro kills chickens later in the film, it reflects the innocence within him he must kill to survive. At one point, he throws an egg at the camera and the yolk drips down the screen.

Buñuel’s surrealism shows most prominently when Pedro has a nightmare. The sound of chickens wakes him up, feathers falling from the sky. El Jaibo lay bleeding and laughing under his bed. His mother talks to him, but her mouth does not move. She offers him the motherly comfort he desires, and he promises her to get a job and change his life. Everything moves in slow motion.

The film also showcases superstitions. One child carries a dead man’s tooth he stole from a graveyard to keep bad luck away. A sick woman holds a dove tied up beneath her bed to absorb her sickness. When the dove dies, she should be healed.

This film’s influence spans from <i>400 Blows</i> to <i>Amores Perros</i> — a bleak film for Buñuel, but compelling.","criterion challenge 2024, cc2024, coming-of-age, 1001 movies, sight and sound, somos",2024-05-31

Tobe Hooper’s first film is a collection of scenes involving a hippie commune in Austin, Texas.

The film doesn’t have a strong narrative through-line. The individual scenes have a slice-of-life quality, capturing the dull hippie conversations — hauntings and sending out vibrations, the definition of communism, but mostly fucking. 

One guy, who never speaks, experiences weird shit in the house. He sees a paper airplane crash into the house and catches fire. He sword fights himself, flipping places when the sword comes in contact. He encounters something in the basement that emits smoke and light. It may or may not be influencing the house.

They pull into Venus, a small town where folks eye outsiders suspiciously. At a diner, they hear about a guy who passed through, ate at the same restaurant, and went missing.

When Ryan's car stalls, they take it to the auto shop across the road. Ryan suspects a scam, but Maya pushes him to stop being paranoid. They must stay at an Airbnb, getting a ride from server Shelly.

When the fridge goes out, Maya calls the conveniently placed number. They initiate sex when, like clockwork, someone knocks on the door. ""Is Tamera here?"" the person asks, draped in shadow. They decline, and the person leaves. ""Where did she even come from?""

When Ryan realizes he left his inhaler in the car, he takes the motorcycle in the garage to grab it and some food. While Maya is alone and pantless, another sharp knock shakes the door. She peeps through the eyehole and sees no one. We see a shadow behind her — someone is in the house.

I didn't hate this — the theater is where to see this. If I had gone earlier and seen it with an audience, I might have had fun.

Unfortunately, the movie makes one too many logical leaps. The killers are always, inexplicably, one step ahead. Did the original movie establish them as having telepathy?

Good performances, good lighting (none of this too dark to tell what's going on bullshit), and consistent tension keep this from being a shitstorm. But it's hard not to scoff when that ""To Be Continued"" flashes on the screen.

I find it funny that the filmmakers have already made two more chapters that follow this movie. They filmed them all concurrently, as though this series will be this generation's <i>Lord of The Rings</i>.

Still, as a former <i>Riverdale</i> fan, I am pleased that Madelaine Petsch is getting lead work. Hopefully, this leads to better things.

Cut to two months later. Laura's sister, Anne, in US Navy regalia, bums a ride with a handsy truck driver to the high school graduation, where Laura will be honored. He insinuates that Navy women are lesbians.

As they stop, Paula runs by in huge earphones. A hand in black gloves starts a stopwatch and runs after. It catches up to her, slits her throat, and stops the stopwatch. The camera makes sure to linger on the outline of Paula's ass in running shorts.

Anne sees her mom and stepdad, who is less than enthused to see her. Anne rests in Laura's room — her stepdad, Ronald, converted her room to a darkroom. She unpacks a gray sweatsuit and a pair of black gloves, just like the ones that killed Paula.

We cut to a dimly lit locker room. Black-gloved hands pull out a photo of the track team. Laura's face has an X through it. The hand pulls out a tube of lipstick and draws an X over Paula's face.

Herb Freed and Anne Marise had a formula for writing the screenplay, studying all the slashers at drive-ins. They arrived at a simple idea: one dead body every nine minutes. As a result, the movie wastes no time wasting teens.

Denise Cheshire does a full-blown uneven bar routine. She wasn't an actress but was a finalist in the 1976 Olympics gymnastics team. She retired from gymnastics and did stunt work, including <i>Jack Frost</i> and <i>Men in Black II.</i> She has one of my favorite exchanges in the movie:

An acting troupe sits in a living room, reading over Lysistrata. The play is a Greek comedy that takes place during the Peloponnesian War in which the titular character persuades the women of the warring cities to withhold sex as a means of brokering peace.

They read a scene in which Lysistrata (played by Liz) is appealing to Kalonike (played by Gunilla) to join her cause — Kalonike places the importance of being a housewife above all else. Gunilla receives a call from her husband Bengt mid-reading, wanting to know when she'll be home.

Cut to the stage, where Liz and Gunilla block out the same scene. The director tells Liz that she doesn't look angry enough. At this, Liz recalls an argument with her husband, Carl.

Gunilla's character states the importance of husbands and children. The director asks her to at least pretend she's interested. At this, Gunilla recalls talking to Bengt about the tour with their four children sprawled out between them.

Marianne, who plays Myrrhine, runs late to rehearsal to deliver her lines, in which she pleads for a voice on the matter. In the play, Lysistrata asks why they should listen to her when she shows up late for the meeting. Marianne mixes up a line, and the director suggests she might get her lines in order if she shows up on time. At this, Marianne recalls standing with her married boyfriend by the lake, pulling her toddler out of his hands, and breaking up with him. Her crying toddler at the theater brings her back to the present.

Cut to Hugo, one of the actors, watching Gunilla, Liz, and Marianne on television, discussing the importance of the play and how it relates to the present. They make jokes about the men in the story being boys.

<blockquote><i>— They never take anything seriously.
</i><i>— What woman ever does?</i></blockquote>The program shows a rehearsal clip in which the women ask Lysistrata what is so important. Hugo cuts off the TV before she can answer.

Thus, the film's cadence goes as moments from the play intersect with moments of the women's lives. They take the play on tour, where audiences are bored or don't get it. The play and reality slide into one another as moments of conversation become indistinguishable from the play and vice versa.

As a piece of filmmaking, it's near perfect. It combines an arthouse structure with human, grounded storytelling. The film performs the impossible task asked of women — to be all things to all people. This movie is Second Wave embodied.

All the principal actors are regulars in Ingmar Bergman films, drawing further parallels in how men tell stories about women versus women telling their own stories.

The film itself received similar responses in 1968 as the audiences to Lysistrata. The critical response in Sweden was so hostile that it would be 20 years before Zetterling made her fourth and last Swedish film.","criterion channel, criterion, criterion challenge 2024, cc2024, solidarity, directed by women, written by women",2024-06-02

No Doubt's Just a Girl erupts over scrapbook patterns and photos. We step into a picture of Venice Beach, through a polka dot curtain, and into Romy and Michele's apartment, where they watch <i>Pretty Woman</i> for the like, 36th time. Ironically, of course.

They get dressed in the most amazing 90s club outfits, just like they do every night. At the club, Be My Lover pulses. They scan the club for cute boys but concede to dance with themselves. When Romy wishes she were lesbian, Michelle offers to have sex with her so they can make sure they're not. Romy declines, telling her to ask again when she's 30.

Romy works at a Jaguar dealership. Heather Mooney from Sagebrush High in Tucson walks in. Despite being uninterested in talking to Romy, Heather asks if Romy is going to the 10-year high school reunion. Romy didn't know about it. At the mention of Michele, Heather breaks down, remembering that Michele dated Sandy, whom Heather was in love with.

Romy and Michele reminisce about high school, looking through their yearbook. They realize they weren't exactly popular or in any particular social group. They were the butt of many popular kid jokes. So, feeling hotter than ever, they decide to go to the reunion and blow everyone away. Of course, that would require lying about careers and boyfriends and everything.

There are so many hot people in this movie. Justin Theroux in a cowboy hat, Janeane Garofalo, Mira Sorvino, Alan Cumming in his straightest role, and on and on.

Robin Schiff's script knows that Lisa Kudrow and Mira Sorvino are the movie, so the plot is little more than a frame to attach funny bits. They're both so funny. There are so many one-liners I had to pause and laugh for.

Some favorites:
* Can you excuse me? I cut my foot before, and my shoe is filling up with blood.
* Do you have any businesswomen specials?
* You know what? I bet everyone made someone else's life hell in high school.
* See, I told you it would pay off to go to those clubs every night.

<blockquote><i>You seen dolls that pee? This one bleeds.</i></blockquote>At the end of Child's Play, Chucky is dead and charred. Now, we watch as Good Guy, who made the doll line, sands down the charred bits, recasts his head, and makes him as good as new.

Mr. Sullivan, the Good Guy CEO, gets the rundown on Andy Barclay and the killer doll rumors. They intend to show the refurbished Chucky to the stockholders to convince them the doll isn't possessed. He watches the mechanics put the finishing touches on the doll. But as they lower the eyeballs into the doll, a power surge comes through the machine, killing one of the toymakers.

Meanwhile, Andy, now 8, sees a child psychologist, who asks him about his Chucky nightmares and how Chucky wanted to take over his body. The psychologist assures Andy that dreams cannot hurt him. Phil and Joanne talk to another doctor about fostering Andy until his mother recovers — institutionalized for corroborating Andy's Chucky stories.

Mr. Sullivan's assistant, Poole, stuffs Chucky in the back of his car on his way to his girlfriend's. When Poole stops to get liquor, Chucky uses the car phone and calls the psychologist, pretending to be Andy's Uncle Charles. Information in hand, Chucky kills Poole and looks for Andy.

Though the director is different, the writer and special effects team return. Ed Gale came back as Chucky's body, which they used a lot more of in this movie compared to the first. The ambition to have Chucky on screen more bites back — the puppetry is not convincing in the full-body scenes. 

The writing is effective at establishing new emotional bonds for Andy. Joanna is so loving — she's the foster mother you dream of a kid finding. Phil, on the other hand, is not cut out to be anyone's parent. The moments between Andy and Phil and Joanne's other foster child, Kyle, made my heart swell.

The kids reading Pinocchio in school is funny.

When Chucky starts killing, I like the movie less. I get it — he's a killer, but the silly kills and Chucky's wisecracking clash with the more emotional aspects of the script excels at. The first movie succeeded because it took the kills as seriously as the characters.

I get why folks love this one — it's slicker, bigger, and zanier. But these movies need to go in a different direction if I'm going to be on board for the sequels.","amazon prime, rental, hooptober, hooptober3.0, slasher, killer toy",2024-06-02

At the end of <i>Child’s Play 2</i>, we left Chuckie dead many times over — hand torn off, legs torn off, scorched in hot plastic, and head blown to smithereens. Andy and Kyle survived, walking off to some unknown future, leaving the devastated Play Pals factory in their wake.

Eight years later, in a speculative 1998, where the 90s are still very much the 90s, workers arrive at the abandoned Play Pals factory, full of cobwebs and doll parts, to clean up and re-open the factory. The workers use a crane to pull Chucky’s corpse from the adhesive pile of melted plastic. The prongs dig into the body, spilling Chucky’s blood everywhere. While dragging the body along, the blood drips into the boiling plastic, mixing with the material.

The Play Pals board meets to recap the story beats from the previous two movies. The board questions the logic of putting the Good Guy back on the market after all the lawsuits and scandals. Still, the Good Guy was their best-selling toy, and what are children, if not consumers in training? The board gifts CEO Mr. Sullivan the first doll off the assembly line to commemorate the moment.

You won’t believe this — the doll comes alive. He tortures Mr. Sullivan with toys to pad out the runtime before throwing out some inane Chucky quip and choking out Mr. Sullivan with a yo-yo. Using Mr. Sullivan’s computer, he can readily find a record of Andy, now 16, whom the state has remanded to Kent Military School after years of foster homes and juvenile delinquency.

Arriving at the school, Andy meets a fellow recruit, 8-year-old Tyler. Tyler checks the mail for any letters from his father. Instead, the officer in the mail room gives him a package addressed to Andy. The corner of the packaging tears, and Tyler sees it’s a Good Guy doll. Excitedly, he runs to the Armory to open the package in secret. Chucky comes alive, annoyed that it’s not Andy. But because of a technicality — new body and all that — Chucky can take over Tyler’s body.

The puppet work is at its worst thus far. With a lower budget and smaller timetable to make the movie — a mere nine months after the previous — all the development went towards making this as efficient as possible. They relied on computers to aid the face work, aligning with prerecorded dialogue. It works and looks pretty good, but when you have the previous movies to compare it against, the flaws come through.

The script is a rehash of story beats from the previous movies. Andy replaces Kyle, and Tyler replaces Andy, but the dynamic is the same. Screenwriter Don Manici said that he was out of ideas at that point — more accurately, his ideas were too expensive, so he scrambled to arrive at this story.

Honestly, this isn’t much worse than the previous movie — it’s predictable. The third-act set pieces are fun enough. I’m looking forward to the decidedly weirder <i>Bride of Chucky</i>.","hooptober3.0, hooptober, slasher, killer toy",2024-06-03

At the end of <i>Child’s Play 3</i>, as with every Chucky movie thus far, Chucky is dead. Whereas the previous film took place in the mystical world of 1998 as seen in 1991, this movie takes place in the actual 1998, one month after the events of <i>Child’s Play 3</i>.

It’s a stormy evening at the Lockport Police Department Evidence Depository. Jason’s mask, Michael Meyer’s mask, and Freddy Kreuger’s claw glove lay locked up, hinting at the meta tone this movie will take. Officer Bailey opens a locker, removes a garbage bag, and places a folder inside.

In the car, he calls a woman, telling her he has the goods — she better have the money. He parks at a warehouse, waiting for her arrival. While he does, he grows curious about the contents of the bag. He opens it to look in. His confused face turns white as someone slashes his throat. We tilt up to see a blonde woman named Tiffany Valentine. She opens the bag and takes out Chucky's smashed remains.

Rob Zombie’s Living Dead Girl plays as the camera looks at various newspaper cutouts for the new viewers. Meanwhile, Tiffany digs through a chest full of doll parts. With those, she sews and staples together what parts of Chucky she can. Tiffany consults Voodoo for Dummies, placing Chucky on a pentagram of sand. She performs the ritual, but it doesn’t seem to do anything.

Damien, who thinks he’s dating Tiffany, comes over. She notices Chucky isn’t on the pentagram anymore. So, she sets Chucky on Damien’s chest and gives the rundown on how she used to date Chucky and that they were to get married. On cue, Chucky rips out Damien’s lip ring and suffocates him with a pillow.

Things only get more bizarre from here. Tiffany and Chucky fight, leaving Tiffany dead and resurrected in a bride doll. The movie follows them as they search for human bodies.

The puppet work is so much better in this one! They have so many more puppetry jokes, including a sex scene that predates Team America and is, thankfully, more tasteful. Relatively speaking.

Having an openly gay character is a pleasant change of pace. The film relegates him to token sidekick, but at least he isn’t a walking stereotype.

In <i>Bride of Chucky</i>, Tiffany doll gave birth before dying in a graveyard. Now, we take its perspective and see wrapping paper torn aside to reveal a blonde girl and her parents. The girl’s smile quickly drops as disgust takes over at the unusual creature before her. Both parents are unsure of the gift’s origin, but the girl throws it into her toy chest.

Later that night, still from the toy’s perspective, we emerge from the toy chest and grab the knife protruding from the birthday cake — an insane way to store a knife. The toy stabs the father in the chest. It rushes up the stairs to the mother showering. Before the toy can stab her, she screams and falls out of the shower, hitting her head. The toy chuckles as blood pours from the woman’s head, confirming the kill. We get a brief glimpse in the mirror of our toy — it is no longer a baby, but a six-year-old child. Before they can stab the little girl, they pee their pants.

The toy wakes up just before a performance as a ventriloquist dummy for Psychs. Psychs named the toy Shitface. They are performing at the International Ventriloquists Competition in Glastonbury, England. Six years ago, Psychs found the doll in a graveyard in the US. Though Shitface has murderous dreams, they are peaceful. They know they’re an orphan and, judging by the imprint on their wrist, that they are Japanese.

A news reporter gives a breakdown of the new horror movie, Chucky Goes Psycho, based on the urban legend of Chucky and Tiffany, two dolls possessed by serial killers. The filmmakers used the remains of the original dolls to make the props. Backstage, actress Jennifer Tilly sneaks a candy bar before going to costume. There, she complains about the shit roles she gets. When she hears Redman is directing a Biblical epic and is looking for a Virgin Mary, she jumps at the opportunity.

Shitface watches this news report from their cage. When they see the Made in Japan imprint on Chucky’s wrist, they realize these are their parents. They concoct a plan to escape their cage and find their parents. Using the Heart of Damballa their parents left behind, Shitface reawakens them. The film follows the family as they plot a way to take Jennifer Tilly and Redman’s bodies and impregnate Jennifer Tilly to give Shitface a body. That is if they can stop killing for, like, one second.

The film has a candy-colored brightness, like Hollywood seen through rose-colored glasses. It gives the film a kid’s movie aesthetic while heightening the grotesque murders.

The film explores gender dysphoria as Shitface was born without genitals. Tiffany believes Shitface is their daughter and calls them Glenda, and Chuck believes Shitface is their son, so he calls them Glen. The naming is a nod to the Ed Wood movie Glen or Glenda. As for Shitface, they feel like both and cannot decide.

It also uses murdering as a stand-in for queerness — something they believe they should be ashamed of, yet isn’t something they control and not something they should “hide in the closet.” This idea is less developed than the Glen or Glenda aspect, which they handle quite well.

To signal the camp vibe they’re going for, John Waters shows up as reporter Pete Peters. He gets a few hilarious scenes.

Like the previous movie, this goes for black comedy over all-out horror. The earlier film had some difficulty signaling that transition, but it allows this movie to go all out as a queer cult joyride.

Henry Kaslan of Kaslan Corporation introduces the ugliest doll imaginable called Buddi. Buddi is a home assistant a la Alexa, but baked into a doll. It also uses “self-learning technology” to learn and adapt to its owner’s routines and surroundings.

Cut to a Kaslan factory in Vietnam, where exhausted employees assemble Buddi dolls and program them. One employee phases out for a second, and his supervisor smacks him in the face. When the supervisor walks away, the employee writes a new routine in the chip boot-up process which removes the safety protocols. Once he installs the chip, boxes the toy, and sends it on its way, he jumps out of a window and commits suicide.

In Chicago, Karen Barclay works retail at Zed Mart. She returns home to her new apartment and her 12-year-old son, Andy. Karen confiscates Andy’s phone when she sees him watching raunchy videos of Buddi humping something? I don’t know.

Back at work, when yet another customer returns a broken Buddi doll, Karen blackmails her boss to let her take the doll home. Karen gives Andy the Buddi doll, which Andy hates, but tries out, anyway. As it comes on, its eyes spark red and it doesn’t sync with the app correctly. Andy tries to name it Han Solo, but it glitches a bunch and calls itself Chucky.

The doll wakes up Andy throughout the night. Putting it in another room or turning it off is an option, but Andy instead suffers through it. The kid teaches it how to brush its teeth and stab a cutting board with a knife. The family cat, Rooney, scratches Andy, and Chucky sizes Rooney up to being a villain. Andy leaves to get a bandaid. When he comes back, Chucky’s eyes are glowing red, and it is strangling the cat.

This movie has “designed by committee” written all over it. The plot writes itself, borrowing whatever beats from the original it needs while tying in AI fear-mongering. It feels like an inevitability more than a passion project, despite what director Lars Klevberg says.

The script has the irreconcilable problem of presenting a sincere product and the cultural ironic detachment around it. No one seems to like or want the Buddi, tolerating its presence out of plot necessity. The toy charges Andy with a butcher knife and cuts him, and they keep it. It kills the cat, and they keep it.

The movie’s strength lies in its gore. Despite the screenplay being PG to PG-13 throughout, the gore ensures an R rating. I feel like teens would be the ones who enjoy this movie, especially as the friends form a pseudo-Stranger Things arrangement. But with that and the odd anti-millennial rhetoric, this is for Gen X I guess.

Buddi feels like ET, especially with its glowing finger that controls things. Of course, ET doesn’t learn to murder.

David James Lewis is the most miscast character imaginable. Did they hire him because he looks like Chucky? His facelift scars are quite prominent in this.

I despise Ty Consiglio in this — he seems like an okay actor, but his character is maddening.

Let me be clear: I have no childhood affinity associated with the <i>Child’s Play</i> franchise, so I don’t care about its relationship to the original. Besides the names, this movie has nothing to do with the originals, so I watched it with that in mind.

I wouldn’t call this an awful movie — it just didn’t give me what I wanted from a horror movie.","hooptober, hooptober4.0, killer toy, edited by women",2024-06-05

The LA police are in a shootout with The World Revolution, a terrorist organization. Among the police is rookie cop Kurt Decoda. He goes over to Wes Strickland, who asks Kurt how he’s enjoying his first day on the job. As gunfire dies down, Wes finds a terrorist and learns about Slash’s plan to kill the governor.

Kurt and Wes meet Governor Hampton at the airport to warn him about a potential attack. They put him in a limo with them and surround themselves with cop cars. Slash, a white guy with a goatee and dreads, hijacks a city bus. It breaks through the blockade, starting another shootout. Yadda yadda yadda, Slash has Governor Hampton at gunpoint.
<blockquote><i>— Governor, it’s time to give the city back to the people!
— What the hell does that mean?
— It means it’s time for you to resign.</i></blockquote>Slash kills Hampton and Wes. Kurt gets to him and disarms him as the other police cars arrive. The court sentences Slash to “holographic stasis” until his “bio-rectification program is complete.” His first hearing is in five years. Coincidentally, LA starts constructing a bio-dome to filter the city’s low-quality air. They will finish construction in five years.

<b>Five Years Later</b>
A flying car sputters over the completed bio-dome. The news announces that California Corp, the company running the government, has ruled elections illegal. With crime rates at an all-time high, Corporate President Edward Jameson has increased police funding and issued a city-wide curfew.

The corporation restores Slash's consciousness and projects him to his evaluation hearing. Though the corporation insists Slash is not up for release, Slash’s team hacks into the mainframe to set Slash free from the confines of the projector. With his indestructible holographic body, Slash reinstates the World Revolution. Can Kurt go into cyberspace and stop him?
<blockquote><i>— You’re sick.
— Don’t you ever call me sick! I may be a little misunderstood, but I am not sick!</i></blockquote>It takes nearly half of the film to get to this point. PM Entertainment is good at a few things: car stunts, explosions, and injecting sex scenes into as many nooks and crannies as they can. One thing they’re terrible at is action choreography. Half of this movie is shootouts. That is a lot of tedious, unmotivated action.

This movie starts hilarious — I was dying laughing. But the movie comes to a grinding halt as it tries to get through its plot.

The special effects are perfectly 90s and by far the best part of the movie. If they were more frequent throughout, I might like this more.

This sucks! I would love to do a super-cut of this to show to friends. But at an hour forty-seven, forget it.

* A guitar wails as the bus goes under a too-low underpass and peels the top off the bus like a can opener.
* When the cops kill Slash’s girlfriend, he cries over her and makes out with her body before leaving her.
* After shooting Hampton, Slash empties his gun of bullets except for one, holding it to his head for Russian roulette. But the moment he holds the gun up, he changes his mind and says he doesn’t want to play.
* To signal Kurt’s hardened demeanor, he also has a goatee.
* William Sanderson shows up as a more annoying version of his character from <i>Blade Runner</i>
* Is it the World Liberation Movement or the World Revolution? They say both.
* Slash’s motivations are vague — he wants to “take back” the government, regardless of who is ruling. In the future, when a corporation runs a totalitarian regime, I’m pretty much on his side.
* Natalie has sex with holographic Kurt, and it causes all the appliances to go haywire and catch fire.

<blockquote><i>It’s a doll. What’s the worst that could happen, huh?</i></blockquote>

A delivery truck arrives at a remote Victorian house. Sarah Pierce cuts pieces of paper and drinks a glass of white wine, standing in front of a mixed-media canvas still life. The bell rings, and Sarah calls her daughter, Nica, to answer. A laptop open to a trans-Europe train trip preoccupies Nica, but Sarah insists. So, Nica wheels to the door in her wheelchair.

At the door, the delivery driver hands Nica a box for Sarah with an all-too-familiar shape. They chat over shitty mothers and recognize one another from a psych class at City College (is this in the Community universe??). When the driver leaves, Nica asks her mom if he was hitting on her. Sarah insists he was just being nice — afraid of Nica getting hurt.

Sarah opens the box with no return address. Inside, a Good Guy doll in a bed of packing peanuts. Neither Sarah nor Nica understand, thinking it must be a joke they’re not in on. The doll introduces itself as Chucky. Sarah throws it in the trash.

That night, Sarah’s screams wake Nica up. Nica goes to the bedroom. On the nightstand are crumpled tissues and prescription bottles. The bed, however, is empty. Nica takes the old-school metal elevator downstairs. A pool of blood spreads out of the shadows along the tile floor in the foyer. Nica calls the police. The Chucky doll sits in a nearby rocking chair.

The police rule the death to be a suicide. Barb, Nica’s older sister, visits Nica, bringing her husband, Ian, their daughter Alice, a live-in nanny named Jill, and for some fucking reason, a priest named Father Frank. Alice discovers Chucky and forms a bond with him. Over time, Nica learns of her family’s connection to Charles Lee Ray and the history of Chucky.

This film is a bit of a return to form, eschewing the postmodern turn of <i>Bride of Chucky</i> and <i>Seed of Chucky</i> in favor of conventional scares. The film keeps its fanbase in mind. It offers plenty of nods to where the series has been.

Fiona Dourif, who plays Nica, looks so much like her father. You could convince me she was Brad Dourif with a yassified filter.

With the lowered direct-to-video budget, the gore isn’t as impactful as <i>Seed of Chucky</i>. That doesn’t stop the filmmakers from going all out — this has the most brutal kills thus far.

I like this movie! Despite being formulaic in certain parts, the movie skillfully generates suspense and provides several unexpected moments. This was the right place to take the franchise and solidified my love for it.","hooptober, hooptober3.0, killer toy, queer",2024-06-06

Rachel debates the Second Amendment with Andy Barclay. They're on a date that turns south when Rachel learns Andy has a couple.

<blockquote><i>— I just want to be able to protect myself.
— From what, exactly?</i></blockquote>

Andy returns home to his remote cabin. Taxidermy animals and antlers line the walls. In the living room, a locked gun case stocked with several guns: pistols, rifles, shotguns, you name it. Behind a graduation diploma from the Kent Military Academy is a safe. Inside is Chucky's decapitated head. Andy pulls the head out, lights a joint, and undoes the gag. Chucky asks for a drag and Andy relents. Chucky fucks around, and Andy helps him find out by blowtorching Chucky's face.

<blockquote><i>Sometimes, it's nice hanging out on a Friday night with your best friend.</i></blockquote>

The opening credits, which feel like a TV show (foreshadowing?), summarize Nica's conviction and sentencing to a mental hospital. We cut to Nica receiving electroshock treatment. A therapist goes over the details of the murders with her.

<blockquote><i>— The murders were real, you know that. But Chucky never was.
— He was a mask I wore so I could go on looking in the mirror so I could live with myself.</i></blockquote>

Because of Nica's progress, they moved her to a medium-security psychiatric hospital, which allows her more free rein and visitors. During a group therapy session, the doctor introduces a Good Guy doll named Chucky — a purchase from Hot Topic.

Later, Tiffany Valentine comes to see Nica. Tiffany has acted as Alice's legal guardian since Chucky killed her parents. She tells Nica that Alice is dead and gives Nica a Good Guy doll, claiming it was a gift from Alice.

<blockquote><i>— Has anyone ever told you that you look exactly like Jennifer Tilly?
— Yeah, I get that a lot.</i></blockquote>

That makes two Chucky dolls at the hospital. But Andy has the real Chucky's head locked away. How are the other Chuckys being brought to life?

The concept of multiple Chucky dolls was something that Mancini wanted to introduce in <i>Child's Play 3</i>. Budget limitations forced him to abandon the idea for the simpler rehash of that movie.

The movie contains multiple in-jokes for fans — for example, a throwaway line about the difference between mass murderers versus multiple murderers.

With so much material to play with, the movie moves effortlessly between its set pieces. This film brings some comedy back, but not in the predominant tone the way it was in <i>Bride</i> and <i>Seed</i>. The kills are creative and brutal. Mancini worked on <i>Hannibal</i>, and it shows — he even throws in a brief mention as Chucky laments its cancellation.

<b>19th Century Sweden</b>
Agnes lay asleep, her breathing labored. Her eyes open, watery. A strong wave comes over her, and she writhes in pain. Her brow furrows as she drinks what water she can.

She pulls aside the rich red bedsheet and dabs her eyes with her shawl before wrapping it around her. At her writing desk, she dips the pen in an ornate inkwell and writes in her diary:

<blockquote><i>It is early Monday morning, and I am in <b>pain</b>.</i></blockquote>She puts a thick underline beneath the word ""pain.""

<blockquote><i>My sisters and Anna are taking turns staying up.</i></blockquote>Anna dresses for the day and prays to God, thanking him for rest and beseeching him to watch over her daughter, whom God took from her. In her daughter's absence, Anna has given herself to caring for Agnes in Agnes's remaining days.

Agnes recalls their mother, now passed, walking the mansion grounds. She thinks about how her mother could be as cold as she could be loving — a trait Agnes understands now. Agnes remembers how mother and Maria whispered together in ways she never did with Agnes. But also of the moments of silence when both understood life's unbearable loneliness.

The doctor, David, comes to see Agnes. Her face glows with recognition. He listens to her heartbeat and feels for sensitive places. She takes his hand in hers and holds it to her chest. As he leaves, he tells Karin, ""I don't think it will be long now.""

Like many siblings, each sister feels alone in their pain, physical or mental. To be alive is to experience an unrelenting emptiness, and to die is to be so replete with pain that no one can find a way in. They each carry their torment in silence, unable to share. The film follows them as each pain comes to the surface — how each daughter is an aspect of their mother, who felt unknowable in her multitude.

Thanks to Roger Corman, this film received solid US distribution, which likely aided in the movie receiving a Best Picture Oscar nomination.

As with Bergman's best films, the human qualities that give the story life are in the cinematic language — that which words alone cannot convey. The cinematography swings between stillness and cursive freneticism, pushing in and drawing across characters. 

This color scheme gives the movie an almost allegorical quality. The interiors are every shade of red and white, some brightly tinted and others subdued. The transitions fade to red and then to the next scene.

Unfortunately, that visual language, as poetic as it is, also creates an emotional distance — Bergman makes every nuance known but not necessarily felt. That absence keeps me from giving this a higher score.

Still, this is a beautifully realized meditation on misery that manages to evade dourness while giving little solace.","criterion channel, criterion, criterion challenge 2024, cc2024, 1001 movies, sight and sound",2024-06-09

Capulina is a nightwatchman for a postal warehouse for unclaimed packages. His boss chastises him for falling asleep on the job, and Capulina promises he would never do that.

So, when he puts on his pajamas and falls asleep on the job, a gang of thieves arrive to steal some ceramic figures. Santo shows up to stop them. Capulina wakes up and tries to help Santo but accidentally captures Santo, allowing the thieves to escape.

After some investigation, Santo learns the ceramics contain diamonds and are part of a diamond trafficking ring. To redeem himself, Capulina will pose as Santo to stop the gang. Through this, he learns that the gang is also making robot clones, including one of Capulina. Thus, Santo vs. Capulina.

For the right fan, this was a major crossover event. Capulina starred in numerous comedies as an oaf getting in over his head but succeeding in the end. Santo is, of course, the most famous luchador of all time.

These fight scenes are rough — no choreography and they feel endless.

The soundtrack is so aggressively kitschy that it's grating. The score has one theme and plays it over and over.

Santo taking off his mask and having another mask on is pretty funny

Finance district, NYC. The sun sets and office lights dot the landscape like dying stars.

Morris takes a swig of coffee before seeing a letter on his desk from the Volmer Institute to Mr. Hank Green (not that one). The letter has a black wax seal of two eels interweaving. He feels chest pains. He drinks water to help it, but it only brings him to the ground, convulsing and dead. 

Cut to a train running through a mountain in the Swiss Alps. Lockhart is on the phone with his assistant, Josh, talking about a merger. Among his paperwork and newspapers is an eel-sealed letter, written by Roland Pembroke, the CEO of the financial firm for which Lockhart is an executive.

While Lockhart reads this letter, we flash back to him entering Morris’s office, which is now his. The board of directors calls Lockhart up. There, he reads the letter. It’s so long, but it’s basically, “I just learned capitalism is bad, but I found the cure, so leave me alone.” The board’s request is straightforward: go to Switzerland and bring Mr. Pembroke back.

Cut forward to Lockhart receiving a taxied service to the spa. The driver asks about the cure. All his passengers are older folks. They all go to the same place. Those who go up, stay up.

The spa has expensive retirement home vibes. Lockhart believes he will be in and out in 20 minutes. Straight away, the place gives him the runaround. That and no cell service makes Lockhart an angy boy. The place offers ancient water with mysterious healing qualities. Lockhart must return later. On his way out, he sees a mysterious woman standing barefoot, watching him.

What happens next — a ballerina, a blue vial, a fire, and other images flash in sequence — will dictate Lockhart’s life as he works to recover Pembroke and to learn the secret of the treatment center and its water.

Thematically, the film looks at the systems we create and how we convince people to participate. Capitalism benefits only a select few, creating a fragile system of dependencies and hierarchies. In the wellness industry, snake oil salespeople sell cures to non-existent diseases, keeping people dependent on something they don’t need. The film merges these systems in a way I won’t elaborate on to avoid spoilers.

The film has an intoxicating atmosphere, not too dissimilar from <i>The Ring</i>. Everything has a green aura that feels sickly or medicinal, depending on the context.

Everyone seems to know a single sliver of the story, so Lockhart constantly learns additional details. But if you’ve seen movies before, you’ll have solved the film’s biggest secrets early on. The mystery that drove me was what was happening to folks at the retreat — we got an answer, but I wouldn’t call it satisfying.

Part of the problem is that the movie is way too long! They could have easily combined several near-duplicate scenes to achieve the same effect and get this under 2.5 hours.

The best aspect of this film is having a budget like Verbinski’s. He produces some insane images that look quite convincing. This movie has some brutal mouth trauma, so here is your warning! Unfortunately, some of the best images left me asking, “But why?”

Dane DeHaan is fine as a finance asshole, but the moment the script calls for an emotional beat, he leaves a lot to be desired.

Mia Goth is always perfect as the siren. She says weird shit, walks around and sings, and looks at you like a haunted Victorian child.

Harry Groener plays Mr. Penbroke, so that’s a treat for <i>Buffy</i> fans.

Overall, there’s a great movie buried here, but the length and structure obscure more than elevate. This film could be someone's gateway drug to weirder movies.","amazon prime, rental, hooptober, hooptober3.0",2024-06-10
2024-06-11,In a Violent Nature,2024,https://boxd.it/6EAFEB,3.5,,"It starts with a locket in a rundown fire tower. Some friends wandering the woods find it, and one pockets it. Moments later, someone emerges from the ground — a once dormant killer, reawakened.

The film follows predominantly from the killer's perspective as he seeks out the locket and murders the teens who may have it in trademark slasher creativity.

The film excels in the contradictions — the killer moving in the daytime, the brutal kills in the serene atmosphere, and the still camera observing the frenetic violence. A couple of the kills are so grotesque that I stifled shocked laughter. I might have let loose if the half-full theater didn't sit there in dead silence.

Some shots remind me of <i>Elephant</i>, the first ""slow"" film I remember watching. There, the long tracking shots were mirrors — an innocuous hallway takes on a haunting quality with the change in who is walking through it. Here, it has no deeper meaning except to show how one-track minded the killer is. We see one exception, but I won't spoil it.

Also, this is a horror film first, so the editors truncated the long tracking shots. The idea is to stretch out the tension to its most unbearable, not to test the audience's patience<a href=""https://www.vulture.com/article/in-a-violent-nature-has-the-years-gnarliest-horror-scene.html"" title="". As another reviewer said"">. As another reviewer said</a>, this is more grindhouse than arthouse.

Still, I heard some exasperated sighs near the end of the movie. The person to my left folded and unfolded their arms as the movie continued. I don't know what they expected, but it wasn't this.

Part of me wants to see that arthouse movie that doesn't cut up the shots. But what we get makes effective use of that cinematic language, even if it isn't towards anything more than a fresh way to shoot a slasher. It might be the most tense and unsettling slasher I've seen.","amc southpoint, slasher",2024-06-10

Sara and Dave are arguing because Dave forgot it was Sara's birthday. They've been together for nearly nine years. We jump into the middle of several arguments — several focus on Dave growing up and Sara wanting love and respect. They break up after their last fight.

<blockquote><i>I needed you to love me, David, and you're incapable of loving anyone but yourself. There's a big difference between being with someone and being there for someone.</i></blockquote>

Cut to five-year-old Felix with a tractor in hand. He wakes his uncle Dave, who is sleeping on the couch. Dave's sister, Tess, is letting Dave crash at hers while Dave figures out his life. Teddy McGiggle (Josh Gad) is singing on television. He announces he's coming to Australia to perform a show.

Tess threatens to kick Dave out unless he contributes, so Dave takes Felix to school. There, Dave meets Felix's teacher, Miss Audrey Caroline (Lupita Nyong'o), whom he falls for. When Dave returns later to woo Audrey (also, incidentally, to pick up Felix), he learns a chaperone has dropped out for a field trip to Pleasant Valley Farm. Dave volunteers to be near Audrey.

In the background, we've seen TV footage of war zone atrocities. We cut to a US Army testing facility, where two soldiers find a loose test subject from Project Regeneration chewing on a scientist's neck. They kill the subject and report it, only to discover that another sector is dealing with a large-scale breach.

The kids cheer on the field trip school bus as several military vehicles race past them. At Pleasant Valley Farm, Teddy McGiggle surprises the kids with a visit. The escaped test subjects meander to the nearest area with people: Pleasant Valley Farm. 

This movie is efficient in doling out a ton of information. The sense of humor works for me. It's not a total laugh riot, but it's consistent. Dave continuing to call Audrey Miss Caroline is a good bit. Also, Miss Caroline quotes Neil Diamond as inspiration.

Tess is a fantastic mother to Felix. She's taught him healthy coping strategies for dealing with moody people of any age. Also, a five-year-old Australian child saying ""tofu"" is a delight.

Alexander England's Dave is a frustrating and familiar character — the 30-something musician who never figured out how to do anything other than make music. His daddy issues come out most prominently in his hilarious and direct lyrics.

Lupita Nyong'o is flat as a kindergarten teacher. She is tremendous once she takes over as the only one keeping everyone together. She also sings and plays ukelele — I dare you not to fall in love with her.

Josh Gad is, as always, the weak link here. He has only ever made anything he's in worse. But I digress.

The zombie special effects are impressive! They're not the main feature, but they get the job done.

I'll admit, seeing echidnas made me giggle. I did a school project on them in 7th grade, and believe it or not, it had nothing to do with Sonic the Hedgehog!

Three people walk through the woods. A man named Mog dons a white suit. Cherry is a woman in a blue dress, walking a dog. Sampo is a man carrying a dead dog. The man in white sings a song called Koko-Di Koko-Da. He gets stuck in a loop. We pull out to an old music box depicting cartoonish versions of these three characters spinning in the display window of an antique shop.

A seven-year-old girl named Maja looks through the window, her face painted like a bunny. Tobias and Elin, her father and mother, run up to her, their faces also painted as bunnies, relieved to have found her. They purchase the music box for her eighth birthday tomorrow.

Elin has an allergic reaction during the meal to the shellfish, turning swollen and deep red. A helicopter airlifts them to the hospital. Since they shared the food, Elin tells Maja to say anything if she feels funny. The family makes a makeshift tent on the hospital bed and sleeps together, laughing about the situation.

Tobias gets a soda, some chocolates, and a cute cupcake with a candle the following day. Both he and Elin set up a tray to surprise the sleeping Maja. They sing a birthday song. Maja does not stir. They gently push her to wake her. Her body is stiff, and she isn’t breathing.

Three years pass. The couple is silent together as Tobias grabs a couple of ice creams from a convenience store. Tobias tries to make a joke, but Elin is upset. Neither wanted to go on vacation. They cannot find their campsite. Tobias puts up a tent by the road.

The following morning, Elin steps out before sunrise to pee. She shines her flashlight around and sees a white cat. The cat saunters off. Twigs snap. A man whistles. Elin turns around to see Mog, Cherry, and Sampo standing before her. She calls out to Tobias, but Mog knocks her out with his walking stick. Tobias watches in horror, unsure of what to do.

The film grows increasingly surreal as the music box characters repeatedly torment the couple. It explores the way grief has isolated the couple from each other. It asks whether they can find a shared understanding and survive.

Maja was perfectly cast — her death was heartbreaking. If life holds meaning, how does a child’s death make sense? What is the difference between a god whose intentions we cannot know and a torturer who relishes our pain?

Once the conceit catches on, the movie becomes tedious. We learn very little about the couple as they loop through. We get one moment of “revelation,” a repeated animation we saw earlier but from another character’s perspective.

This movie started tremendously and fizzled out fast. It’s not a terrible movie. Those with kids or a different audience may find this more enjoyable than I did.","freevee, hooptober, hooptober3.0",2024-06-12

<b>1918, Tumbbad Village, Western India</b>
Vinayak’s mother is Sarkar's mistress. She performs sexual favors, as well as cares for Sarkar’s ancestor, an old woman she must feed to keep asleep and at bay. The mother works on the promise that Sarkar will give her the gold coin adorning the shrine of Haster.

She is late to return, so Vinayak and his younger brother, Sadashiv, prepare a meal. But their mother returns home before they attempt to feed her. The old woman awakens, begging to be let go — that she doesn’t want the treasure.

Sarkar dies. The woman and her children intend to leave. Vinayak mentions the treasure rumored to be buried in Sarkar’s mansion, but Sarkar never found it. He believes the old woman knows something about it. Bad fortune befalls those who even mention the treasure. Sadashiv falls out of a tree, hitting his head. The mother must run to get help, leaving Vinayak to feed the woman. If she wakes up, he must invoke the name of Haster to make her sleep.

On the way to the doctor, the mother stops by Sarkar’s mansion to grab the coin. The old woman awakens and asks Vinayak if he wants the treasure. The trick works and she traps him. She pulls a pin from her face and pours blood over him. He has trouble but remembers the name Haster, which sends her away. His mother comes to him — Sadashiv has died — and they run. Vinayak begs to go back so he can get the treasure from her. His mother gives him the coin and tells him never to return to Tumbbad.

Fifteen years later, Vinayak lives in poverty and still thinks about the treasure. So he returns to the old woman and learns her secrets. The film follows Vinayak’s journey and the terrible lessons he learns.

The film has the structure of a morality folktale. Nothing about the narrative is surprising. Where the film goes into the unexpected is in the visuals. The legend details a god who lives in his mother’s womb, forced to live in obscurity. We see the god and the womb — wild stuff.

<i>TW: Self-Harm</i>

<blockquote><i>Make a living… work… and so forth.</i></blockquote>

Kotoko (Cocco) works in a shop, delicately underlining ""Sale"" on notices. When she looks up, she notices a man with his son. Her eyes shift to her left. She sees the man again, standing and staring at her. While one version of the father laughs with his child, the other grows angry and charges after her. She recoils, expecting a blow, but nothing happens.

<blockquote><i>I see double. I can't tell which one is real. I must stay alert — otherwise, I could die.</i></blockquote>

Back home, she sets down her keys and removes her ring — a fake wedding band she wears to deter men. She takes a knife to her inner arm, next to older scars, and lets the blood run down her forearm.

<blockquote><i>I just need to confirm if I'm still allowed to exist.</i></blockquote>

Kotoko is a single mother with an infant son named Daijiro. She worries about people taking Daijiro from her.

<blockquote><i>He totally relies on me, trusting his tiny life to my frail arms. What if I let my arms go? What if I open my arms a little? He'll fall. He'll fall if I let him.</i></blockquote>

She goes on the roof with the baby and drops him off. When she comes to, she screams and begs her neighbors to call an ambulance. When she gets to the ground floor, she doesn't see him. She returns to her apartment and finds him lying in the living room.

She holds Daijiro while trying to cook a meal. He screams at the sound of the sizzling wok and the steam. When the meal finishes cooking, she tries to pour the food onto a plate but drops the wok on her feet. Frustrated, she screams and throws the wok through a window.

Her neighbors call the authorities, believing she is abusing Daijiro.

Kotoko's sister takes the child. After some time, they allow her to see Daijiro, but leaving him again only makes her feel worse.

She intends to end her life — until a man named Seitaro Tanaka (Shinya Tsukamoto) shows up and takes an interest in her.

Cocco, a professional singer, wrote the story, composed the music, and handled the art direction for the movie. She has a specific vision for this character and gives us so much empathy and care for her.

The story explores the fear of not trusting yourself or your perception of the world.

Shinya Tsukamoto's frenetic style of filmmaking heightens the hallucinations and moments of despair into a full-blown horror show.

These moments contrast eloquently with the soft moments of love with Daijiro, and when Kotoko sings — her singing is the only thing that stops the doubles.

The resulting film is a brilliant depiction of a narrator so unreliable that we cannot trust anything we see on screen. More importantly, it showcases a character we understand and care for, regardless of her experience.

The depictions of self-harm are unflinching. They border on tasteless but further emphasize the level of disassociation Kotoko experiences. The film also explodes into other forms of violence as Kotoko's relationship with Tanaka grows increasingly violent. We need to see the word she sees, as fucked up as it may be.

Tracking the passage of time is difficult until we see Daijiro again. Every time Kotoko sees him, he's older.

This film is an impossible film to make — I've seen similar attempts that err into either saccharine or edgelord territory. The movie remains in a constant place of uncertainty, disquiet, and naked emotion that hit me like nothing else has.","hooptober, hooptober3.0, j-horror, amazon prime, rental",2024-06-13

Robert Ledgard is a world-renowned plastic surgeon specializing in facial reconstruction for burn victims. After years of research, he has developed an artificial skin resistant to fire and bug bites. He calls it GAL, named for his wife, who burned to death in a car crash.

But Ledgard has a secret. At his estate, he holds a woman named Vera prisoner. She wears a skin-colored jumpsuit. With the help of Ledgard's housemaid, Marilia, they feed her and provide her with a means of expression. Still, they deny her anything sharp.

After a talk, Ledgard returns home and turns on the television. On the screen is a camera feed of Vera naked in bed. He goes into her room to give her opium but sees she has slit her wrists and her body with the edges of the book dust covers. He carries her to his in-house operating room to tend to her wounds. She begs for death. He comments on how soft her skin is.

After testing GAL on Vera, he presents his findings at a symposium. Though he hides it in the talk, he confides in the president that he grew the skin using transgenesis, which is illegal. The president forbids him from continuing.

With his research complete, Ledgard must figure out what to do about Vera. Marilia suggests killing her before she kills herself. Vera offers for them to live as equals.

While Ledgard is out, Marilia's estranged son, Zeca, comes to the estate. He robbed a store and wants Ledgard to give him a new face. He discovers Vera and threatens to uncover secrets that may undo everything Ledgard has worked for.

Antonio Banderas returns to work with a more refined Almodovar, visiting somewhat familiar territory as their previous collaboration, <i>Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!</i> Both deal with Banderas keeping a woman hostage and deal with how men demand ownership of women's bodies. 

The film explores how our appearance doesn't necessarily reflect our identity. Kind and generous people are not always attractive to the ones they want. Aging skin can make us feel older than we are. Folks are born a sex, or assigned one, that doesn't reflect the one they experience inside. Whether it be the temporary change of a mask at Carnival or the permanent change of plastic surgery, many of us change ourselves in search of a more authentic self.

What horrifying reality would it be, then, if someone were to change that against your will to their means? 

<blockquote><i>I breathe. I know I breathe.</i></blockquote>The film has a sterile quality that makes sense for the subject matter but is uncommon for Almodovar. It attempts to blend his usual melodrama with horror. I'm on the fence about it, but they help sell each other.

It's hard to say much about this movie since so much of it is about its dramatic revelations. But this is a stunning and unusual film.

<blockquote><i>Be silent in that solitude,
   Which is not loneliness — for then
The spirits of the dead who stood
   In life before thee are again
In death around thee — and their will
Shall overshadow thee: be still.</i>
— Edgar Allan Poe, <i>Spirits of the Dead</i></blockquote>This film is a horror anthology with no overarching narrative, collecting three shorts by three directors, each based on an Edgar Allan Poe story. These shorts differ from most horror anthologies in that they have a budget and subtext.

I watched the French language one, not the AIP-distributed one with Vincent Price's narration.


<b>Metzengerstein — Roger Vadim ***</b>
Frédérique, Countess of Metzengerstein, inherited her family's fortune at 22. Since then, she has ruled by capricious whim. The Metzengersteins have a longstanding rivalry with the Berlifitzings. Baron Wilhelm Berlifitzing lives alone in his family's castle. Though the two have never met, Frédérique openly mocked him any chance she had. But Wilhelm remains uninterested in her or her hedonistic lifestyle.

One day, Frédérique steps into a trap in the woods. Wilhelm comes across her and saves her. She becomes enamored with him, but he remains uninterested. She acts out on her anger by setting the Berlifitzing stables on fire. This invites a strangeness into her life that will become her doom.

I remember reading the original story with capital-G Gothic tones and morality tale structure. This short omits the more obscurant elements, such as an ironic prophecy and ambiguously satirical details, which have only confused critics and historians regarding Poe's intent. The result feels like the grounding for every Amicus story in their anthologies.

Jane Fonda is great as the petulant Frédérique. You could replace Peter Fonda with a sock. Having siblings play potential lovers is quite a Poe move.

This came out shortly after Vadim's <i>Barbarella</i>. This is the least horny thing I've seen him direct. Which isn't a high bar — he's a horny director (aka French).

My only complaint about this one is that it's a tad meandering. In most horror shorts, a narrator or character often verbalizes the meaning of the passage of time. Most of the time, I prefer this approach.

The filmmakers tell the story well, but it lacks interest beyond the Gothic vibes.


<b>William Wilson — Louis Malle ***.5</b>
William Wilson runs through the streets of Bergamo in Northern Italy. His face is bloody and his military uniform is sweat-soaked. In his mind, he sees a man falling from a bell tower onto the city streets. Over and over, the image strikes him.

He runs into a church. The bell-ringer shows William his scabbed and bleeding hands. He pushes the priest into the confession booth and confesses to a murder. The person? A stranger, yet someone he has always known.

William tells the perplexed priest the story of his life of cruelty and how, in childhood, he met a boy also named William Wilson who bested him in everything.

I enjoy a good doppelgänger story. I watched <i>Kotoko</i> yesterday, and it deals with the fascinating concept of seeing other people's doubles — the manifestation of what she believes their true intentions are.

Here, like Metzengerstein, the short omits some nuances of the story, such as William Wilson being a fake name the narrator gives, which only adds further confusion when he meets another William Wilson.

This story feels like genuine horror. Alain Delon's William Wilson is a nightmare person. The story is okay, but the filmmaking makes this far more compelling. The effect of cutting into the man's chest looks realistic! I'm not sure, but they may have used an actual cadaver.


<b>Toby Dammit — Federico Fellini ****</b>
An airplane lands. A round display's video feed disconnects from the screen. A strong wind in the airport blows nuns around. Hasidic Jews walk backward up the escalator.

Everyone looks. It's Toby Dammit! Paparazzi unfurl like smoke from recesses in the wall to get his picture. The lights disturb him, so Toby throws his suitcase at one, knocking him over. He gives a melodramatic speech about detesting light.

Toby gets in a car with the filmmaker he'll be working with. They rant about their influences, from Roland Barthes to John Ford, littering their language with pseudo-intellectual nonsense.

The story continues in this chaotic structure, during which Toby, an alcoholic, has visions of a girl carrying a white ball. This may or may not be the devil.

This story takes the most liberties with the Poe story but also captures the sense of alienation and misanthropy that drives the original. In the same way that Poe used his story to critique writers and styles of his time, Fellini uses images and references to directors and artists of his time. 

The atmosphere is quite surreal and artificial — more so than I've seen in any Fellini, but I also have seen nothing past <i>8 1/2 </i>and his LSD experiments.

I'm going to give up on trying to analyze this one — it's like, uh, trying to describe a Fellini movie. I love it, though.","criterion channel, frightfest guide to ghost movies, horror anthology, gothic horror",2024-06-14

<blockquote><i>These are wicked times... Soon there'll be folks by with even less than us.</i></blockquote>In the style of a 19th-century novel, a narrator introduces us to the meager town of Dogville, in which folks have little and only ask that what is good be shared.

Tom Edison organizes town meetings that few desire to attend. He believes the township is poor at receiving, but cannot envision a gift they could receive.

He hears gunshots off in the distance. Then, a stranger wanders into town, a woman horrified and looking to get away. Tom hides her in the mines as men come looking for her. Her name is Grace.

The film is a long observation of how Dogville will receive this gift. As the pressure increases to turn Grace over, the cost of her staying grows in unforeseen ways.

On the black box stage, the film depicts the town outlined in white on the floor. Some props and set dressings occupy the stage with the actors, but for the most part, the filmmakers have inscribed the name of an object, building, or road where it would be. The compositions become digital when shot from above, comping in characters and set pieces necessary to the shot.

Sound effects and score accompany the film — for example, though there is no door, an actor may pantomime opening and closing it, and the sounds of an opening and shutting door follow the gestures.

The camera work is customary of Von Trier, with artificial shake and zooms. The color grading has a sepia quality, giving it the sense of ""old-timiness"" or destitution. But the minimal staging can only hint at it — we must fill in the stereotypes with our imagination.

What makes this movie worth watching are the performances. The actors give us characters that believe in the world they occupy, and that is what we need to care about any of the surrounding details (or lack thereof). As characters, they're more archetypes than people, but it functions for the film's somewhat allegorical nature.

The film explores morality, punishment vs. exploitation, and how labor can be indistinguishable from either. The people of Dogville have learned the lessons of capitalism, taking the gift of labor and squeezing it for extra. When someone's life depends on your benevolence, should it surprise you when it turns into debt? Scale that out, and you have the poor and lower class. At every stage, the view skews downward.

What is the cost of honesty? To survive is in some ways to lie to yourself because you need that idea of yourself and others to make the concept of tomorrow tolerable.

This film requires getting to the end (like the credits) to assess — it will reward patience if you have it.","torrent, acc2024, anti-criterion challenge 2024, solidarity, edited by women",2024-06-15

Mrs. Nina Resta leaves her condominium with her son, Pricò. Nina cancels plans with another resident and goes to the park. There, they pass by a puppet show where two puppets fight over a woman they both love, one puppet being the woman's fiancé. The children laugh as the puppets fight to the death. A toddler cries, and the mother turns his head to look.

Nina lets Pricò ride his sick 40s scooter around, letting other children touch it but never ride it. Meanwhile, Nina meets with Roberto. They make plans to run off together. Nina wants time, but Roberto insists today. They believe they are out of Pricò's sight, but he sees them talking. Nina tears up but insists otherwise when Pricò notices.

That night, they have dinner with Nina's husband, Andrea, who runs late for a condo meeting. Before Andrea arrives, the residents complain about the money they have poured into elevator maintenance when it won't go down. The meeting lead suggests they let the elevator only go up to save money.

Nina puts Pricò to bed, promising they'll see the puppet show again tomorrow. But when Pricò wakes up the following morning, Andrea is disheveled and running late for work. He meditates on the made bed that appears untouched from the previous evening. Pricò runs to him and looks around.
<blockquote><i>Your momma isn't here. She's gone.</i></blockquote>The other residents speculate on where Nina is, but they all agree she likely ran off with a man. Andrea cannot imagine caring for Pricò alone, so he takes Pricò to live with his aunt. There, the women whisper about their affairs, believing Pricò doesn't hear them. They give him work to keep him occupied, but he listens to everything they say.

Pricò tries to have a normal childhood but lives in the shadows and ramifications of the choices adults make around him. He carries a guilt that the adults don't understand and a head full of moments that don't add up.

Children hear and know more than you think. They may not understand the specifics, but that may cause more suffering than if you are honest with them. Just because they are silent does not make them oblivious.

Many of my childhood memories are things my parents said and did around me — some when awake and some when they thought I was asleep. Both said horrible things about the other, often using my behavior as a reminder of the other's failings. I was their spitting image, and it wasn't a good thing.

Unlike later De Sica, the material conditions that underlie the social conflict are not as in the forefront.  The film takes place in Italy just after the collapse of fascist rule, and German forces still occupied the country. If the film is allegorical, though, it's lost on me.

The film's message is never subtle. It doesn't need to be. The story verges on melodramatic, but I don't mind that. What stands out most to me is how authentic its observation of children feels, at least as it relates to my childhood.","criterion channel, criterion, cc2024, criterion challenge 2024",2024-06-16

<b>London — 1886</b>
Henry Wotton takes a taxi to see an old Oxford friend, the painter Basil Hallward. Hallward has been secretive about his latest painting, which piqued Wotton's interest. Despite the butler's protestations, Wotton enters Hallward's study to find him working on a portrait of a handsome young man.

<blockquote><i>We suffer for what the gods give us, and I'm afraid Dorian Gray will pay for his good looks.</i></blockquote>At the sound of the piano playing, the two venture into the parlor to find Gray playing. Wotton takes the opportunity to preach his hedonistic lifestyle and to dissuade Gray from a life of philanthropy. While doing so, he captures, kills, and mounts a rare butterfly.

They marvel at the finished painting, shown in three-strip Technicolor to contrast with the otherwise monochrome film.

<blockquote><i>As I grow old, this picture will remain always young. If it were only the other way... If it were I who would always be young and that picture that would grow old... For that, I would give everything. I'd give my soul for that.</i></blockquote>Wotton points to a cat statue of an Egyptian god. He warns that it is quite capable of granting the wish.

Gray follows Wotton's advice and seeks the pleasures formerly unknown. This inclination leads to him meeting tavern singer Sybil Vane. He courts her with Chopin and the two fall in love.

Wotton gives Gray a test for Sybil to confirm her love. Though Gray thinks it is reprehensible, he cannot help himself. The cost will be more than he can bear. Only the portrait reflects the change, whose expression alters into one of cruelty.

If youth has one folly, it's the belief that there is still time to fix what you broke. Though life may have many days, their length may grow unbearable with the hard-earned wisdom of the irreparable. For one like Gray, who has traded his soul for endless youth, the misery is boundless, and he must forget his heart to make it through.

The film relies on incessant narration to convey Gray's inner state. The lack of faith in the audience and dependence on the book dries out some emotional weight. It's a shame because the movie has moments of genuine heartbreak.

The color inserts of the painting are inspired and are so striking! That's the only effect done with any effort, unfortunately. Though Gray stays the same age and others age around him, we see no visible change in any other actor except for Gladys, who grows from a child to an adult.

Hurd Hatfield gives a decent performance as someone who lost their soul but still sees from within what is happening. Angela Lansbury shines the brightest — her naive love is the most genuine element on screen.

The film tones down the homoeroticism of the novel, but not by that much. The men can talk of women and whatnot, but how they discuss beauty, especially Dorian's, has no straight reading.

Overall, I was impressed with how bleak and close to the novel the movie was, especially for the period.","tubi, hooptober, hooptober3.0, queer, gothic horror",2024-06-16

<blockquote><i>In England, there is no district more dismal than the vast expanse of primitive wasteland, the moors of Dartmoor in Devonshire.</i></blockquote>Sir Charles Baskerville runs through the foggy night, a howling chasing him. He makes it through the gate of the Baskerville estate but collapses in the garden, clasping his chest. A man emerges from the trees, reaching for Sir Charles' pocket watch. A voice calls out from Baskerville Hall, scaring the man off. Mrs. Barryman brings a lantern.

Cut to Mr. Barryman finishing the account for the coroner's court. They called Dr. Mortimer, who was at dinner with Miss Beryl Stapleton and her brother, Jack. Dr. Mortimer attributes Sir Charles' death to heart failure, perhaps caused by a needling worry he carried. When asked for clarification, Dr. Mortimer's wife, Jennifer, grabs his coat. Mr. Frankland interrupts to insist that someone murdered Sir Charles.

Big Ben strikes midnight in London as we venture to 221B Baker Street, where Dr. Watson reads of Sir Henry Baskerville's arrival from Canada to assume the title and estate of the late Sir Charles. Per Sherlock Holmes' request, Watson cuts the clipping from the newspaper. Why? Because Holmes believes that someone will murder Sir Henry.

Dr. Mortimer comes to Holmes, worried that someone will murder Sir Henry. Historically, every Baskerville who has inherited the estate has come to a violent end. Mortimer confides to Holmes what he had not to the coroner — that near Sir Charles' body were the footprints of a gigantic hound. He shows Holmes an old parchment he discovered in the house: Legend of the Hound of the Baskervilles.

Sherlock Holmes is on the case!

This film is one of the first Sherlock film adaptations to be based in the original period. Prior adaptations updated the story to a contemporary context.

For all the Basil Rathbone movies I've seen, this is the first Sherlock of his I've watched. My dad always complained about how dry they were, but this is right up my alley! He's much more energetic and funny than in some other roles.

<b>Sleepy Hollow, 1790</b>
Ichabod Crane, the Yankee schoolmaster, arrives on a carriage, his head buried in Cotton Mather’s book on the history of New England witchcraft. Before arriving, Crane read up on the superstitions of Sleepy Hollow, most famously, their Headless Horseman legend. The horseman was a Hessian trooper who rode each night from his churchyard grave in search of his head, which he lost in battle. Unlike some, he believes the story to be true.

Katrina Van Tassel is the daughter of Baltus Van Tassel, the wealthiest farmer in the Hollow. She has some suitors, but Abraham Van Brunt (aka “Brom Bones”) is her most favored. They and the school committee congregate to welcome the new schoolmaster. Upon meeting Katrina, Ichabody drops his hat in excitement. Some folks worry about hiring such a fussy Yankee instead of an honest, god-fearing Dutchman.

Ichabod is a strict schoolteacher, birching students for even the most minor offenses. A child comes home limping from the thrashing he received. Though his father assumes the child deserves it, the mother works to have Ichabod dismissed.

The film follows Ichabod’s foibles as he loses favor with the town and eventually faces the Headless Horseman.

I’m a little lost regarding the negative reviews. I don’t think it’s a tremendous achievement in film, but it’s a faithful adaptation with effective ghost special effects. Will Rogers hams it up as the arrogant idiot Ichabod Crane, giving the film a more comedic tone than outright horror. The film spends more time showcasing his foolishness than dealing with the headless horseman, so maybe that’s why it’s disappointing folks.

An SUV drives down a California highway. Todd and Sara give a ride to four folks — Jodi, Keren, Jeff, and Eric. Suddenly, a tire blows out, and they swerve to the side of the road. Everyone gets out to see what's happened. Jodi grows dizzy after bumping her head, so Jeff helps her into the backseat. Saran and Keren tend to her while Jeff grabs a baggy and some ice to make an ice pack.

Sara and Todd step away with a phone to call roadside help. They haven't seen a car on the road in ages, and the phone reception is spotty. The boys decide to take the spare and change it themselves. Jeff inspects it and says it's pretty worn down. Thankfully, Keren finds a shop 20 minutes away where they can get their tire patched.

Sara takes a selfie of everyone to commemorate the moment. She uploads it to [insert social media platform] and chats with her friend Alex online. She passes a roadside memorial where the picture is missing. Everyone does some characterization chatter — surprise birthday parties, people in bands, [name] likes [name], and so on.

Eric steps away to pee, and Todd joins Sara, leaving Jeff to change the tire. He picks up the blown-out tire (which rolls away and seems full of air?), and a bullet casing falls out. The others hear the tire iron drop. Todd sees the tire rolling away and chases after it. Sara comes around to joke about how long it's taking. She finds Jeff with a hole in his skull and brain matter splattered all over the car. Sarah feels something, and blood cascades down her face and onto her hands. Everyone stands there and looks at her, repulsed. Another bullet brings her to the ground.

Keren tells everyone to hide. The bullets fly. Jodi, Keren, and Todd hide behind the car, but not before a bullet clips Todd. Eric takes cover behind a tree stump. Who is shooting at them out here? And why?

What's left is a compelling setup and 70 minutes of movie left.

Let's address a few matters. Everyone has the visual range of an infant, unable to see anything more than a couple of feet away from them. No one is giving a compelling performance, and the dialogue is mechanical. The gore is cheap and rarely convincing.

Sharni Vinson's character in <i>You're Next</i> may not have been the first of this troupe, but several budget horror flicks have followed suit, leaning on an ""army brat, hunting family"" character to avoid everyone being killed off instantly.

Despite everything mentioned, the film's major flaw is the lack of likable characters. Everyone is a tremendous asshole to each other, so it's impossible to root for anyone to survive. But that seems to be the point: to watch folks suffer. Scared, grossed-out kids puking, bleeding, and pissing everywhere. Crows picking at eyeballs and brain matter.

We open on a beautiful commercial for Pan Am Airlines, scored in Stelvio Cipriani's cheerful bossa nova. Peter Kleist's plane lands in Austria, where he meets his uncle, Karl Hummel. Peter is interested in a ghoulish baron on his father's side, Otto Von Kleist, AKA Baron Blood.

An entrepreneur named Herr Dortmundt purchased the baron's old castle, Schloss des Teufels, to remodel into a hotel. Eva oversees the castle renovation, ensuring Dortmundt does not illegally change the castle's architecture. Eva joins Peter and Karl at Karl's home for dinner, along with Karl's wife Martha and daughter Gretchen (played by Giallo regular Nicoletta Elmi). Gretchen describes Baron Blood, claiming to have seen him at the castle.

After Gretchen goes to bed, they discuss Elizabeth Hölle, who cursed the baron with a spell that allows him to rise from the dead so that she can punish him. Peter produces a document containing the spell he found at his grandfather's place. The legend goes that when read in the room where Hölle killed the baron, he will return to life.

<blockquote><i>We live in an enlightened age, Peter, where science not only reveals the old mysteries as mere superstitions but, little by little, discovers the true mysteries of the universe. However, I would not play with the occult if I were you.</i></blockquote>

So, of course, Peter and Eva play with the occult. They travel to the castle and read the spell. A strange wind blows, and noises fill the castle. Eva begs Peter to read the reversal spell, but a gust of wind blows the paper into the fireplace. Then, from the castle's woods emerges the bloodthirsty baron.

If you've seen enough of these movies, the rest of the plot will play before your eyes. The film introduces a trillion more trinkets and artifacts that do something for or against the baron. Meanwhile, the baron runs around torturing and killing folks.

The castle has great Gothic vibes. It's a shame more of the movie doesn't take place there. We also get splashes of Bava's colorful style, but nowhere near enough. At this point in his career, his cinematography is precise and we get some elegant shots. One sequence stands out where Eva is on the run — fog and lights out the wazoo.

Somewhere in the text is a critique of greed or consumer culture — a group of wealthy bidders show up at the baron's castle to purchase a bunch of big-screen TVs. I won't pretend to understand it.

Pulsing techno. Strobing lights. The vague outlines of bodies dancing. We focus on Victoria, dancing and smiling, occasionally fixing her hair. She goes to the bar to order a Schnapps, using English to speak to the German bartender. She's in Berlin but doesn't speak German.

As she heads to the bathrooms, some boys ask her if the club is good. She smiles politely and works past them to get to her bike outside. The boys introduce themselves and offer her a ride in a car that isn't theirs. The owner chases them off, and they walk with her as she rides.

Victoria is from Madrid and has been living in Berlin for three months. She doesn't know anyone. They go into a shop Sonne claims is his and take some beer while the shopkeep sleeps. Some men approach them, and Boxer has to send them off. Victoria tries to get to the cafe to open, but the boys keep pulling her in.

We follow Victoria for the next two hours as she learns about the boys, their past, and an important plan they've made that day. We also learn about Victoria and the life she left behind. But we may never understand why she is so reckless.

The film is one continuous shot. No cuts, 2.5 hours. It took them three takes to get the energy right. The way the movie progresses, the single take keeps the momentum and tension high. I don't think it's essential, but it doesn't feel like (just) a gimmick.

More importantly, the performances are stellar. The script is loose, and the actors improvise most of the dialogue. As a result, the conversations, the flirtations, and the misdirects all feel organic.

Laia Costa, who plays Victoria, is incredible. I need to see her in more things.

Franz Rogowski plays a bag of bad vibes, as per usual.

The film accomplishes some dramatic irony by translating the German that Victoria doesn't understand, so we catch on to the details before she does.

In their head are the endless cries of those next to die — those asking for death's release and those begging for one moment more. Death's feathers are filthy after ages of going from person to person, unstopping as the voices are unstopping.

Tuesday is a 15-year-old girl living in London with her mother, Zora, and her nurse, Billie. Tuesday has a terminal illness — breathing is difficult and painful, so she has learned how to meditate on it and breathe through the pain. Zora has not worked in some time. For money, she sells paintings, furniture, and assorted tchotchkes — when we meet her, she is pawning a collection of papal-themed taxidermic mice.

Death comes to Tuesday, so Tuesday does what she thinks she should — she tells them a joke. Death laughs, at least to the degree a parrot can laugh. Tuesday notices that Death has glue on their talons, making walking difficult. So, Tuesday offers to run them a bath. When Death feels overwhelmed with the voices of those crying out to them, Tuesday walks them through a breathing exercise.

So, when Tuesday asks for a moment to say goodbye to her mother, who isn't home — unbeknownst to Tuesday, Zora has fallen asleep on a park bench after eating a few mini Babybel cheeses — Death grants her the time. Little does Death know just how in denial Zora is regarding Death's existence.

This movie takes some big swings. I don't appreciate swings for their own sake, as they are often empty of motivation beyond shock or confusion. Here, the risks connect with the film's core, which explores grief in all its stages.

And it works! Sort of.

As you may see from reviews, this isn't the consensus. Like all risky movies, not all audiences will buy into the premise or choices made.

The reason the movie worked for me is because of Julia Louis-Dreyfus. She embodies her complicated and flawed character. So, for what missteps the movie makes, the impactful moments hit hard and honestly. She has lines that ring true because they are things I have said in my moments of grief.

If you're on the fence, save this one for streaming. But this was a moving and emotional experience for me, so I was thankful to see this in a theater where I could feel it most.","amc southpoint, directed by women, written by women, edited by women",2024-06-19

On the morning of her going to camp, however, the puberty alarm goes off, and some new emotions join the team: Envy, Embarrassment, Ennui, and Anxiety. If that isn't enough, Riley discovers that her friends aren't attending the same school as her next year.

At her core, Riley believes she's a good person. But anxiety sees a million futures in which everything goes wrong. So, it's time to repress some emotions and build a new self based on these projections. We follow Joy, Anger, Disgust, Fear, and Sadness as they fight to loosen Anxiety's reign and potentially unlock some repressed memories.

With Pixar announcing that they'll play it safe with sequels and familiar IP, this film can appear as the last glimmer or the sign of things to come. Like many of their sequels, this film takes on a smaller story and invariably retreads familiar territory from its first movie. But both movies share a core message — all emotions are valuable. We can experience them and the world around us without losing ourselves.

Is this movie going to change the world or win awards? Probably not. But compared to Pixar's weaker output lately (except for <i>Turning Red</i>, which I loved), this is a reminder that they can still hit, even if it isn't to the caliber they once did.

A raven caws in the Parma Opera House — an inauspicious sign. Mara Czekova is an opera singer. She is practicing her role as Lady Macbeth in a modern rendition of Verdi’s Macbeth. Macbeth — also an omen of bad luck. She has trouble concentrating with the raven’s noise. Finally, she throws a shoe at the bird and storms out, complaining to the director. While storming out, a crowd forms around Mara. She doesn’t see that she is stepping onto the road, where a car hits her and knocks her unconscious.

Betty, Mara’s understudy, receives a mysterious call that tells her she will debut as Lady Macbeth. Her agent, Mira, comes to her place to confirm it. Though Betty is apprehensive, the director is confident that she knows the part and can perform it.

That night, she gives a tremendous performance. A figure hides in an empty box seat, watching Betty’s performance through binoculars. We see disjointed scenes of women tied up and pursued. A stagehand discovers the figure and attempts to escort them out. The figure knocks stage lights off the balcony and pushes the stagehand into a coat rack, murdering them.

No one notices the murder, only the lights, so the show must go on. Betty finishes the show with a standing ovation. Mara watches on TV from home, her foot in a cast and a glass of wine dangling from her fingers. After the show, a man comes by with a present from Mara: a note (“Good luck, little snake”) and a vial of some horrendous-smelling liquid.

We enter fantasy — bondage, lingerie, an unusually wide tactical knife. Video footage plays back Betty’s performance. Zoom. A box full of rope and curved implements with rows of needles. Someone is fixating on Betty — someone that Betty knows from her past.

Everyone around Betty is obsessed with her sexuality — she’s frigid if she doesn’t give them what they want, or a whore if they can take it from her. As Betty ascends to fame, people project their insecurities onto her and want to possess a part of her, if only to give their own meager life a glimmer. She has no control over her life and how the world sees her. So, of course, Betty doesn’t know who to suspect, only narrowing it down as the stalker murders more people in front of her.

<blockquote><i>If you close your eyes, you’ll tear them apart. So you’ll just have to watch everything.</i><blockquote>

The murders she witnesses are total nightmares. Steel Grave’s songs play each time. They’re a little silly but don’t undercut the moment too badly.

The film uses a perspective camera, adding to the subjective and uncertain mood. We take the killer’s, Mara’s, and even a raven’s perspective. Color and lighting are classic Argento — vibrant and meticulous.

The film takes on a meta quality at the end with scenes shot in the Swiss Alps, visually referencing Argento’s previous movie, <i>Phenomena</i>. It would have worked better if Jennifer Connelly could star in this movie too. Also, the director character functions as an Argento stand-in. I don’t want to say too much, just to avoid spoilers, accidental or otherwise.

We scan an industrial district of Madrid before joining a news report from BWC News. The Department of Health has announced a radioactive spill at the state nuclear plant. While serious, officials claim to have responded in time to avoid any negative fallout.

Dean Miller, an American TV reporter, receives an assignment from Mr. Desmond to interview Professor Hagenbeck, one of the nuclear station’s original planners. Miller has a philosophy of straightforward truth, whereas Desmond favors thorough reassurance.

Miller brings a cameraman to the small airport to await Hagenbeck’s arrival. The airport control tower receives an unidentified trace. They cannot get in touch with it via radio. As it comes into view, they recognize it as a Hercules military transport. However, the plane has no identifiable markings. The plane lanes, but they see no pilot. The military police surround the plane, calling for the passengers to disembark.

Hagenbeck steps out of the plane. An officer approaches. Hagenbeck stabs the officer in the neck. Dozens of men, covered in unusual sores, pour out of the aircraft, attacking the police. The police shoot the men, but it doesn’t stop them or even slow them down. The men bite into the police, drinking their blood.

Miller and the cameraman flee the scene and return to the studio. Miller commandeers the studio control room to announce to the public. Before he can start, the chief calls to cut off the broadcast. General Murchison made the call to avoid a panic. Miller quits and faces the overrun city to find his wife. Also, for whatever reason, we follow General Murchison’s tomfoolery since he’ll be the first to get answers for what the hell is going on.

Unlike Romero’s zombies, Lenzi’s zombies are fast, can use weapons, and seem to keep their intelligence. They just also want to murder and eat folks. They’re not undead, but more dudes with charred deformities growing on their bodies. Per Lenzi, they’re not meant to be zombies so much as people with radiation sickness. Of course, this is an exploitation flick, so that means they also tear open women’s shirts to eat their breasts.

The first act is as economical as it comes, giving us everything we need to understand the movie and our protagonist.

Mel Ferrer, who plays General Murchison, seemed familiar to me. It turns out I’ve seen him in a couple of things, but <i>Eaten Alive</i> was what I remembered. TIL he was married to Audrey Hepburn for a few years.

I only know Hugo Stiglitz by name, as Tarantino paid tribute to him by naming a character after him in <i>Inglourious Basterds</i>. He’s been in hundreds of movies, so I’ll see him again.

Look, is this film nonsense? Kind of! Did I enjoy it? Kind of! Similar to <i>Ghosthouse</i>, I kind of gave up following exactly what was happening and rolled with it. I think anyone who isn’t a fan of goofy genre fare will have a miserable time.

An older man walks his golden retriever, Bessy, along the East River on the Brooklyn side, near the Brooklyn Bridge. You know, where they stereotypically say the mob tosses bodies. He’s being so sweet with her — I nearly cried! After finding a stick, he throws it into the brush, encouraging Bessy to fetch it. Bessy comes back with a decomposing human hand in her mouth.

A police officer brings a photo of Anne Lynne to Lieutenant Fred Williams. Dubbed “the Brooklyn Bridge girl,” the officer has confirmed that the hand belonged to Anne. Mrs. Weissburger, Anne’s landlady, waits to speak to Williams, brimming with tenant gossip. She confirms Anne was an exotic model, and the last time she saw her, she was making an appointment with a man who talked like a duck.

Meanwhile, a blue Mercury tails Rosie, a woman on a bicycle in Manhattan. She rides to the Staten Island Ferry, where she accidentally collides with a red Beetle.

<blockquote><i>— Goddamn it! Why can’t you watch where you’re goin’?
— Sorry, I was thinking of Boston.
— You women should stay home where you belong! You’ve got the brains of a chicken.
— And you’re an asshole. Ciao!</i></blockquote>

After the Beetle gets on the ferry and the driver leaves, Rosie jumps in the vehicle and writes a message in lipstick on the windshield. She gets “SHiT” written out before the Mercury driver approaches her. He jumps in the car with her and talks, sure enough, like a duck. He draws a switchblade and quacks, slashing into her.

Barry, who performed the autopsy on Rosie, speaks with Williams and confirms that the murder is in the same style as Anne Lynne’s, as well as a Harlem case from a month back. Williams tells the press there’s a serial killer on the prowl. 

Following up his Gates of Hell trilogy, Fulci takes a step back from the supernatural psych-outs and returns to form with a by-the-books serial killer story with all the sleaze and gore he can muster. 

The actual gift the movie offers is all the early 80s footage of New York and Times Square when grindhouses and live sex shows littered the street like cheap flyers. Our killer hates the perversity and seeks women who enjoy sex.

The film makes the rare but admirable choice to depict sex workers as folks who are in it for the money, and that the sex may as well be any other form of labor.

The kills are fucking brutal — lots of cringing, and “Oh god!”s and “Jesus Christ!”s exclaimed.

That ending, too…

At the end of <i>Basket Case</i>, formerly conjoined twins Duane and Belial fell from a window of the Broslin Hotel. The two fell onto the pavement.

A Channel 8 news reporter is on location in Times Square, exposing Duane and Belial. Granny Ruth and her granddaughter, Susan, catch the news report.

An ambulance takes Duane and Belial to the hospital with a security detail outside their door. The guard flirts with a passing nurse, missing Duane waking up and hiding. When he enters to check on them, Belial chokes the guard out.

The press is barred from entering the hospital, but that doesn't stop reporter Marcie from sneaking in and lying about having permission. She attempts to pay off the police while the brothers sneak out of the hospital. Outside, Granny Ruth and Susan pull up in a blue van to rescue and bring them into hiding.

Duane wakes up at Granny Ruth's surrounded by folks with similar genetic deformities to Belial — people the outside world would call monsters. The film calls them ""freaks"" to further emphasize the homage to the 1932 film.

For Belial, they bring him a large wicker basket and take him to the attic, where Granny Ruth introduces him to the other ""freaks,"" including Eve, who is similar to Belial in appearance.

The film follows them as they adjust to their new life, with Duane carrying resentments toward Belial for him killing Sharon in the first movie and Marcie doing everything in her power to expose them and their doctor murder spree to the world.

Eight years is a long time between movies. They had to rebuild Belial, so he looks pretty different — altogether better but still not the same. They do an okay job of disguising how much Kevin Van Hentenryck has aged with the head bandages, but once they come off.

I love the character designs for the ""freaks."" 

The movie is so dependent on the first movie, repeatedly recapping stuff. We even rewatch flashbacks from the first movie. As a result, the movie has almost no momentum.

The movie has recurring moments where men catcall and act sleazy around women. It compares this form of exploitation with that the freaks face — people reduced to objects for consumption or scorn.

Annie Ross hams it up and is visibly having the most fun of anyone onscreen.

Overall, this film is a delightful creature feature, even if it doesn't have much else to offer. The last 15 minutes, however, are pretty outrageous.

It's night in Hong Kong, and neon lights the streets. Tequila pours himself a vodka soda, slams the glass on the table to fizz it up, and takes it down in one gulp. As he smiles, he exhales cigarette smoke and picks up his clarinet. He's on stage at The Jazz Club, playing in a four-piece band, including Benny. At night, they're jazz musicians. During the day, they are HKPF on a Special Forces team.

In the early morning, before sunrise, Tequila and his partner, Benny, go undercover to surveil a gun smuggling deal in a teahouse. Like many traditional HK teahouses, folks bring their birds in cages to enjoy birdsong while drinking tea. Tequila's cage has a hidden mirror that allows him to watch the deal as it happens behind him. By appearances, the men are selling a bird. But when the manilla envelope full of cash crosses the table, Tequila makes his move.

The two charge the table. Tequila forces the birdcage off the table and stomps it, unveiling the guns hidden in a compartment underneath the cafe. A man sitting a ways away, who also observed the deal, stands and draws an SMG. Gunfire and screeching birds fill the cafe.

Dozens fall: police, gangsters, and civilians. It comes down to Tequila, Benny, and the gangster with the SMG. They burst the door to the kitchen open, and the gangster kills Benny. Tequila charges in and gets the gangster at gunpoint. Rather than arrest him, Tequila kills him to avenge Benny. Chief Superintendent Pang arrives on the scene and reprimands Tequila for murdering his key witness. After Benny's funeral, we learn Tequila also accidentally killed an undercover cop.

Cut to Alan, a Triad assassin who works for Uncle Hoi. At the library, he pulls a copy of The Complete Works of Shakespeare off the shelf and sits with a man he claims betrayed Hoi. Alan opens the book to find it cut out, with a silenced pistol in the cutout. He shoots the man in the head and leaves.

The librarian who witnessed the whole event relays it to Tequila. Replaying the events, he finds the Shakespeare book and the gun. The hunt for Alan begins, which pulls Tequila deep into a world
of gang rivalries, double-crosses, and an ocean of spent bullets. The police work has made Tequila hard, but the men he pursues are harder.

A recurring theme is loyalty to Hong Kong — the people born there can't see themselves leaving. Those are the folks who end up dead, not getting out when they had the chance. The film extends that to gang loyalties, undercover cops, and secret codes — how can you be loyal when you don't know who is on your side? But how can you survive unless you learn to trust?

Tequila has ruined his love life for work and his bad habits. He has to learn to trust others and get outside of his hard-boiled thinking if he's going to survive.

I'm very annoyed with Amazon's lazy subtitles. A lot of the plot is conveyed through newspapers that it doesn't translate, so the plot gets confusing.

Like many great action movies, the relationship between Tequila and Alan takes on homoerotic qualities. I don't want to say too much and spoil anything, but there is a scene where Alan looks at Tequila in such a specific way *chefs kiss*

That said, the actual stars of the movie are the action scenes — so many top-notch set pieces, stellar choreography, and squibs for days. John Woo perfected the action sequences that are so good you'll forgive a nonsense plot.

<b>Evans City, Pennsylvania</b>
Billy and his sister run around the house. Billy pretends to be a zombie and scare her. They hide when their father enters the kitchen with a crowbar, breaking everything in sight. Billy smells kerosene, and the two run upstairs to wake their mother. The sister pulls back the sheet to find her throat slit. When Billy turns around, his father throws a torch into the kerosene, setting the house on fire. 

The fire siren pulls David and Judy out of bed. David joins fellow firefighter Clank on the scene. Judy, a nurse, goes to a doctor's office to treat the burns on the surviving kids. When Judy arrives, Major Ryder and his team take over the office. The sister has died, and Billy is holding in.

The major explains that they're quarantining the town due to a highly contagious virus codenamed Trixie. The armed military raid the houses while wearing hazmat suits, rounding up the town citizens. They confiscate all the weapons.

The doctor tries to sneak Judy out to avoid exposing her and the fetus gestating in her. No one else knows what's going on. All we know is that whatever Trixie is, it turns people into homicidal maniacs.

The film explores government inefficiency in handling a crisis, even in a town as small as Evans City. Their martial law approach costs many lives, assuming everyone is too stupid to understand, let alone comply of their own accord. Our protagonists, however, also mistrust the military, as both are Vietnam veterans — they've seen their incompetence all too well. Still, they question whether they're doing the right thing.

While we see the effects of Trixie on people, the military presence hits harder on the town's citizens. It isn't subtle.

<b>Spain — 1492</b>
A group of royals gather around a stone tomb. Two men attach chains to hooks on either end of the tomb as the chain raises the cover, unleashing the stench of old death. They carefully pull the skeletal remains of Don Alfonso D’Alba Molina out of the tomb and bring them before Grand Inquisitor Torquemada.

<blockquote><i>Satan is ever present among us. Every sin, deed, word, or thought, no matter how long forgotten, must be truly confessed and punished.</i></blockquote>

Torquemada declares D’Alba Molina guilty of heresy. Two of the inquisitor’s men tie a rope around the remains’ wrists, accidentally pulling one arm out of its socket. They declare D’Alba Molina’s wealth and the wealth of his heirs as forfeit to the Church. They also sentence the corpse to twenty lashes. The inquisitor’s torturer, Mendoza, issues the lashes, sending dust, bone debris, and bits of skeletal remains scattering through the room. Finally, they put the pieces of bone and skull into a mortar and pestle, grinding them to dust and filling an hourglass.

Cut to Maria kneading dough. Her husband, Antonio, comes behind her and kneads her breasts. Maria stops, feeling the pain of all those tortured by inquisitors. She refuses to sell her bread in a venue where people will attend torture later. But the crowd pulls them into the public execution of the D’Alba Molinas. They try to leave, but cannot. 

Maria tries to stop it, begging for mercy. A guard raises his sword, but Torquemada stops him. He reaches out to her, and she grasps his hand to beg. Aroused, he pulls it away, accusing her of witchcraft. Imprisoned, Maria meets Esmerelda, who has confessed to being a witch. Together, they work to escape from Torquemada’s grasp.

The film is a gory, Poe-tinged inquisition film with a fair amount of poetic justice. The performances are pretty solid, and Lance Henriksen is at his most unhinged. My favorite performance, however, comes down to Frances Bay, who gets to be a messy witch who lives for drama.

The film is pretty well put together for a Full Moon picture — definitely a higher caliber than their usual fare. This isn’t my favorite Stuart Gordon movie, but I could see myself rating this higher on a future rewatch.","amazon prime, hooptober, hooptober3.0",2024-06-24

A woman lay on her deathbed. She sings a song that details her rape and the death of her husband. During her assault, she was pregnant with her daughter, Fausta. As she dies, Fausta joins in the song, singing the little things she does. Before Fausta knows it, her mother has died.

Fausta steps outside to hear her cousin, Máxima, complaining about her bridal train being too short. Máxima's parents, Fausta's aunt and uncle, assure her it looks fine. Máxima asks Fausta what she thinks, and Fausta collapses, bleeding. 

She wakes up in a hospital room. A doctor explains to her uncle that Fausta has a potato in her vagina — an older generation's method of dissuading rape attempts. She will not let the doctors remove it or treat her. If the potato remains inside her, it will spread bacteria and cause more health problems.

The uncle informs the doctor that Fausta bleeds and faints when she's scared because of Milk of Sorrow — a Peruvian disease, said to be transmitted through the breast milk of women who were victims of rape during pregnancy.

The doctor offers to help cauterize the wound that causes her to bleed and informs the uncle that Milk of Sorrow is a superstitious belief, not an actual disease.

Fausta wants to take her mother back to their village for burial, but her uncle does not have the money for such a trip. So, she takes work for Aída, a wealthy pianist.

The film follows Fausta as she spends more time with Aída. Fausta must decide whether she can continue to live in the fear her mother passed down to her or experience a life of her own.

The history of the Peruvian conflict is long and complex, going back to 1980. While the conflict mostly subsided by 2000, remnants of Shining Path are still active in select parts of Peru. During those 20 years, statistics estimate between 50 and 70 thousand deaths occurred, with at least 75% of those deaths being Native Peruvians. Security force members and the army used mass rape as a war strategy, wherein as many as 30 men would rape a woman. These attacks would often result in pregnancies.

The film explores the generational trauma these events caused through Fausta, who grew up with her mother's stories of what happened to her and the people she knew. Though not stated in the film, actress Magaly Solier Romero, who plays Fausta, is Native Peruvian, born to a Quechua family. She has been an outspoken supporter of keeping indigenous culture alive.

It also explores class disparity and how the upper class can so casually exploit lower-class people. 

The potato is an intentional choice for its prominence in Quechua culture. The potato is the most basic part of their diet. Peru has over 2800 native types of potatoes. They say different potatoes can cure certain illnesses. They also play a role in cultural traditions. For example, the film shows a ritual in which a man's mother gives a prospective daughter-in-law a knobby tuber. She must be careful to only peel the skin. If she peels more than that, she cannot marry the woman's son.

The film does not chase any straightforward answers. Her fear is justified and understandable. Even when she attempts to trust no men in her life, men still betray it. How she can escape it is uncertain. How it manifests in Fausta belongs to her and grows abstract in places — the presence of a man can cause as much fear as a drill. 

The movie acts as a glimpse into a culture folks like myself know little to nothing about. Fausta's trauma gives us one aspect, but the film is multifaceted in its intent, for better or worse.","acc2024, anti-criterion challenge 2024, coming-of-age, indigenous, directed by women, written by women, golden bear",2024-06-24

It’s winter in NYC. Hundreds of children are dying from Strickler’s Disease. Schools lay empty, with memorials surrounding their gates. The CDC declares an epidemic. Two years in, they know cockroaches are spreading the disease but cannot find a cure or vaccine. Dr. Peter Mann, Deputy Director of the CDC, calls on Dr. Susan Tyler, Professor of Entomology at the New York State University, to assist.

Dr. Tyler and her team enter the sewers and introduce a genetically engineered bug into the ecosystem — a termite and mantid hybrid they deem the “Judas breed.” The bug releases an enzyme that accelerates the roaches’ metabolism, starving them to death within hours. They are also all female, to prevent their breeding and continued existence, and equipped with a suicide gene to make sure they die within 180 days. Six months later, no fresh cases of Stricker’s occur. Peter is thrilled about the fame they received. Susan is concerned with the ecological impact of introducing a new species into the world.

<b>Three Years Later</b>
It’s raining in NYC. Reverend Harry Ping runs to the roof of his building. An unidentifiable shadow chases him. Once on the roof, he bolts the door behind him, trapping the shadow within. Harry leaps to some painter’s scaffolding just as the shadow breaks through the door. The shadow races to the building’s edge to find Harry hanging on to the swinging planks. The scaffolding swings, Harry loses his grip, and he falls into paint cans, spraying white paint everywhere, similar to the white secretion of the Judas breed.

A child named Chuy witnesses the fall. I guess he’s on the spectrum because the boy lists off the dead priest’s shoes. The shadow clicks and chitters outside, dragging Harry’s body into the sewers. Chuy recreates the clicks with two spoons. He mutters to himself about the funny shoes the shadow wore.

The following day, Peter and his assistant, Josh, arrive on the scene. They find three dozen people trapped below the church, all with yellow fever. Peter and Josh work to quarantine the area, hoping to contain the spread of the disease. Just below them runs a major sewer line. Josh finds fecal matter smeared and dangling from the ceiling. When he tests it, he finds coat buttons inside.

Susan meets with Remy, a colleague of hers. Two kids approach them just outside Susan’s office. They have an assortment of bug specimens. She shows them termites and explains how their colony thrives, protects territory, and relies on one fertile male to keep the colony going.

<blockquote><i>— Just imagine you’re one of them.
— Eating furniture and stuff? That’s gotta suck.</i></blockquote>

The kids also sell her what they call a “weird bug.” Outside, the shadow watches them. Susan opens the box after the kids and Remy leave, finding a baby bug she can’t immediately identify. The bug snaps and latches onto her gloved hand. She pulls it off and pins the bug to an insect mounting board. A white foam emanates from the bug, and Susan realizes this bug is related somehow to the Judas breed.

We follow Susan and Peter as they investigate their findings. How is the Judas breed still alive? Who is this shadow, and what do they have to do with the Judas breed?

<blockquote><i>They were designed to die. They are breeding.</i></blockquote>

Like most of Del Toro’s movies, the movie explores hubris, where people overstep nature and face consequences. With Chuy, we also get the outsider who learns the way of a group and infiltrates them. With him and his father, we see the immigrant experience and how we ostracize what we don’t understand. We also touch on the juxtaposition between how animals reproduce in nature versus how humans have trouble getting pregnant.

The practical effects are superb. Norman Reedus’ specimen that he showed the team made me genuinely nauseous. The CGI effects are… fine.

F. Murray Abraham gets to show up and be right about everything all the time. I can’t help but wonder if he requests these types of roles after playing Salieri.

Once they get into the sewers, the movie slows down to an unbearable crawl. The sets are neat and they learn interesting stuff, but it’s not that fun to watch. I’m choosing to blame Harvey Weinstein.

Overall, I like a lot about this movie, but not as much the experience of watching it.","paramount+, hooptober, hooptober3.0, good for her, nature attacks",2024-06-25

<b>St. Louis, 1977</b>
A black Cadillac drives the city at night, stopping at a pier. The men exit, pulling an unconscious Peter Sykes out of the back seat. Sykes is a known murderer and bank robber. They throw him into the Mississippi and drive off.

Susan walks up the stairs to her apartment. Once inside, she calls for her roommate, Jenny. When she turns on the hall light, she finds Jenny dead, pinned to a door.

Two detectives, Paul and Larry, arrive on the scene after the police have detailed the place. They wait until the team finishes collecting prints and pulls down Jenny’s body to interview Susan. Susan mentions a boy named Charlie who came by her office to have an interview with Susan’s boss. Jenny ran into him later that night. Susan stays with a friend upstairs, so she isn’t alone.

Cut to Charlie going for a jog, remembering how he killed Jenny. Later, he freezes up and flashes back to Vietnam — explosions, missing limbs, and whatnot.

He finds and steals a car. He comes across a hitchhiker and picks her up. She tries to talk to Charlie, but he drives erratically, reliving Jenny’s murder over and over. It seems like he may have killed her because of his low libido. They arrive at the beach, and for some reason, the hitchhiker sticks around and goes skinny-dipping. Surprise, Charlie freaks out and kills her.

The detectives follow Susan’s lead and speak to her boss. But her boss is being cagey about Charlie. When they leave, the boss calls an associate — a former army buddy of Charlie. It seems Charlie is part of a larger conspiracy between conservative business leaders in the community. But Charlie was only supposed to kill Peter Sykes, not all the other women he continues to kill.

<blockquote><i>I wish our friend Charlie would go out and kill himself. Sure would save us a whole lot of work.</i></blockquote>

Who will get to Charlie first? How many will Charlie kill until then?

The film blends vigilante and slasher — an interesting idea that isn’t explored well here. The detective work is tedious because we already know what’s going on. Meanwhile, the film only gives the conservative cabal attention near the end. Mostly, we just watch Charlie kill.

The movie has so many minutiae — standing around while someone finishes something, giving detailed directions over the phone, and SO MUCH SMALL TALK. They throw around names of characters we never see. Meanwhile, we wait for a character to say the name of anyone we see.

I guess we’re supposed to assume that Vietnam made Charlie a serial killer, or awakened something in him. Regardless, he kills against his will — it’s more compulsion than predilection.

So, somewhere along the way, when it becomes more detective story than slasher, the film charmed me. I think Susan doing detective work added a more compelling dynamic. In the end, Charlie gets the short end, plot-wise, because all we know is that he’s a Vietnam vet who kills.

The third act is legitimately good! It’s a shame that the movie up to that point is okay, verging on bad.","tubi, cmc, cmc2024, slasher, namsploitation, vigilante, video nasties",2024-06-25

Two teens are backpacking. It’s night, and they’re looking for a place to camp. They find a gate with a sign. It reads “Military Test Site. Restricted Area. No Trespassing.” So, they decide to trespass. Inside, they find a holding pool. The water feels great, so they skinny dip. One feels bites. Suddenly, his body is convulsing and blood is spreading through the water. He goes underwater. The other stays in the water and faces a similar fate.

Cut to Maggie McKeown playing a Jaws-themed arcade game. She works for a skip-tracing company — they find missing people. Her boss, Earl, gives her the details of her job — to locate the missing teenagers. She takes a plane and rents a jeep to meet up with Paul Grogan, who will be her local guide.

When she meets Paul, he’s uninterested in helping her. But when he mentions a military testing site, she insists he helps her. At the compound, they find a lab. It looks as though someone is actively using it. The jars are full of unusual creatures and one walks by that they don’t notice. Maggie drains the pool to see if the kids’ bodies are down there. Little does she know that, by draining the pool, they’ve unleashed something into the river. And a summer camp is downstream.

It’s fun seeing Corman regulars such as Dick Miller, Paul Bartel, and Barbara Steele.

It’s pretty funny that Corman slashed the budget of this movie to fund what he thought would be the superior movie: <i>Avalanche</i>. We lost out on stop-motion piranhas for a disaster movie I only know about because of <i>MST3K</i>.

Several scenes have newspapers or magazines strewn about with absurd headlines. Like an officer is reading a copy of Headquarters Detective that reads, “The Perfect Crime? Piranhas Don’t Leave Many Clues.”

The gore and the piranhas’ victims are surprising — a more cowardly movie would’ve had our heroes stop the piranhas before hurting who they do in this movie. Then again, the film becomes quite a downer.

I don’t love the movie, but I appreciate much of what it does and understand why folks love it. I wouldn’t call it better than <i>Jaws</i> — more horrifying perhaps — but it ranks high among the many <i>Jaws</i> clones that came out.","shudder, hooptober, hooptober3.0, nature attacks",2024-06-26

<blockquote><i>The backcountry of the Amazon contains over 50 thousand miles of unexplored waterways. Who can say what may be living in that jungle — as vast as all Europe?</i></blockquote>

Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, author of the originating story, and his dog, Roy, introduce the story and declare his intent in writing it: to bring joy and a boyish sense of adventure.

We join Ed and Gladys in conversation. Gladys refuses Ed’s proposal, declaring she will only marry a man “of great deeds and strange experiences.” Dismayed, Ed rushes to his office at the London Record-Journal. Two writers discuss a controversy surrounding one writer’s recent article on Professor Challenger. Challenger is a well-known zoologist who recently returned from South America. He claims to have seen living mammoths, pterodactyls, and other dinosaurs. Alas, he lost all proof except the crude sketches in the diary of American explorer Maple White.

Ed begs his boss, Mr. McArdle, to send him on a dangerous assignment so he can impress Gladys. Ed knocks over an inkwell, spilling ink on McArdle’s papers and the floor. He slips and slides into the office of the writers. They send Ed to the Zoological Hall, where Challenger is lecturing. At the Zoological Hall, famed explorer John Roxton shows up to check the truth of Challenger’s story. Roxton expects heckling from the students in the audience, though he confides in Ed a curiosity for what undiscovered life exists in the unexplored wilderness.

Professor Summerlee reluctantly introduces Challenger. Before Challenger speaks, a student demands Challenger produce evidence. Challenger challenges anyone to join him on a trek into the Lost World, where he will show them firsthand. Summerlee accepts the challenge, intent on proving Challenger a liar and fraud. Roxton jumps in. Ed also joins, seeing a perfect opportunity to have the experiences Gladys requires of a fiance. They all convene at Challenger’s and meet Maple White’s daughter, Paula, who tells them the true nature of the trek: to rescue the missing Maple White. Ed sees sufficient human interest for the London Record-Journal to finance the expedition.

And so the team sails to South America. What they see may astound them. But will they survive to tell the tale?

The movie is a delightful adventure, featuring footage of native animals and stop-motion animation for the assorted dinosaurs. Willis O’Brien, who did the animation for <i>King Kong</i>, did the animation for this movie 8 years earlier. I love his style — we’ve seen it so much that it feels cozy. Reportedly, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle showed friends O’Brien’s animations for this movie and claimed it was actual footage.

As you might expect from a 20s movie in South America, we get the full spectrum of racist caricatures. Jules Cowles dons blackface to play Zambo, an Indian servant.

The version on Amazon Prime cuts 30+ minutes from the movie — you’ll get less backstory and more action if that’s your bag. The version of Wikipedia is the most complete, but it lacks audio. It’s silent anyway, so it’s not essential. Still, I listened to the album <i>Emergency!</i> by The Tony Williams Lifetime. “Sangria for Three” is great fighting dinosaur music.

Dr. Harry Brewster and Frank Stanley wait at the train station for a friend of the Caldwell's named Count Alucard.

Matthew brings the luggage on a carriage to Caldwell's New Orleans plantation, called Dark Oaks. Katherine meets him, followed by her sister, Claire.

I am in awful fear and there is no escape for me. I am encompassed with terrors I dare not think of.</i> — Bram Stoker, <i>Dracula</i></blockquote>

The film explores the thin veil between reality and superstition — what one can know versus what one can apprehend. Those who believe in the occult are not safe from it — in fact, their belief may lull them into a false sense of security.

The film briefly touches on class — a man confesses to murder, but his associates assure the sheriff that he's innocent and not to bother. The sheriff reminds them that money doesn't make a person any more or less liable to murder.

The film's plot is solid, albeit unexciting. No one's performance is outstanding, but Lon Chaney Jr. is pretty dull as Dracula. He's at his best when he can go big, and this film doesn't afford him the opportunity. He isn't Dracula in <i>House of Dracula</i>, maybe because he plays The Wolf Man instead.

If you haven't noticed, Universal has made it a habit of regularly returning to their monsters. Understandably, they had stepped away from horror and saw their profits dip. They showed a <i>Dracula</i>/<i>Frankenstein</i> double feature, an immense success. So, they set up a slate of new horror films. Among those was the Son of Dracula.

Historians often group this movie with other 40s Universal Horror movies, which are not well-liked, except for the outstanding <i>Son of Frankenstein</i>. In recent years, some critics have reevaluated the film, comparing it with director Robert Siodmak's excellent noir films. While it's easy to praise the lighting and atmosphere, only so much filmmaking can compensate for a routine story.

That said, there are a handful of scenes, where relationships and betrayal are at the forefront, where the movie shines.

I like this movie! Despite its flaws, it maintains more consistent intrigue than <i>Dracula's Daughter</i>, even if it lacks the homoerotic undertones that I associate with Dracula.","tubi, hooptober, hooptober3.0, vampires",2024-06-28

Jessie and Gerald pack small suitcases. Jessie packs a new silk slip alongside her toiletries and clothes. Gerald packs a couple of sets of handcuffs in his. They go on a romantic weekend at a lake house. They have drifted apart after eleven years of marriage. This trip is their last-ditch effort to rekindle the marriage.

The radio distracts Gerald with a story about a grave robber before Jessie draws him back to the road. He stops just before colliding with a dog munching on roadkill. Gerald honks to get it to move, but Jessie takes pity on the starving creature. Still, they leave the dog behind as they pull up to the lake house.

Once there, Gerald steps aside to take a work call while Jessie dons her sun hat and takes in the lakeside view. Jessie finds some Kobe beef steaks in the fridge. She cuts one up to bring outside for the dog. Meanwhile, Gerald pops a 100mg pill of Viagra and ushers Jessie inside to ""get comfy."" 

Jessie changes into her slip, pulling off the price tag. She poses seductively and fidgets with the slip and how it falls on her. Gerald enters shirtless, handcuffs in hand. He locks her arms to the bedposts. Jessie is visibly uncomfortable, but accommodating.

Gerald steps away to take another Viagra. His tone changes as he pretends to be a stranger who has found Jessie chained up. Jessie tries to play along, but the game becomes violent and she demands he stop. Gerald's resentments surface and the two get into a heated argument. Jessie begs him to get the keys off the bathroom sink and uncuff her. He refuses. Before they can agree, Gerald has a heart attack and dies, leaving Jessie trapped.

We spend most of the movie watching the conversations in Jessie's head. She recognizes what led her here and, hopefully, the means to escape. But a man shows up. Jessie cannot tell if he is real or a trick of the moonlight.

Though the relationship plays into familiar gender troupes, it still touches on an authentic dynamic.

When long-term relationships drift apart, one partner can fill their head with fantasies they're sure their partner would not consent to, and likely seek that elsewhere.

The film also explores how childhood traumas inform the people we have relationships with, whether we realize it. As many of us discover, we seek the familiar over the healthy.

Carla Gugino is incredible here. This whole movie rests on her performance, and she nails it.

The hand trauma in this movie is the most brutal I remember seeing. Jesus Christ!

Mike Flanagan is consistently as bad as Stephen King at endings, and this movie is no exception. The movie didn't exactly have subtext, but the ending erases any shades of nuance. The last moment is so baffling.

Still, those final fifteen minutes don't undo the tense and engaging experience before it. Folks have often considered the original Stephen King story unfilmable. This movie doesn't disprove that, but it's the best possible attempt I can imagine.","hooptober, hooptober3.0, good for her",2024-06-29

The following day, Sunny's scraggly little dog, Princess, leads the boys to a nest of eggs. The boys fuck around, stealing and breaking eggs. One of them sneaks off and hides an egg in his bag. Flat Dog watches and waits for her chance to enact her revenge. When the boat comes unmoored overnight, the kids find themselves 30 miles from help and ripe for the chomping.

Hooper hoped to return to form with a movie about teenagers messing around in matters beyond their comprehension. The mythical background to the croc hints at that, but the rest of the film is standard ""killer animal"" fodder.

We also spend so much time with relationship drama! I guess it's supposed to get us invested in these fratty boys and nondescript girls. Or maybe it's to get us hating them more. No one gives outstanding performances, but Caitlin Martin is a cut above her costars. It probably helps that her character has more than one dimension.

The kills are okay. A couple are really funny and cartoony. One bro bends down on a small dock to puke in the water. Flat Dog takes a single bite, eating the guy and taking out a croc-shaped hole in the dock.

What has helped Hooper's late career films stand out is their weirdness. <i>The Mangler</i>, <i>Toolbox Murders</i>, and <i>Mortuary</i> aren't outstanding, but they're nutty as hell. This movie hints at a similar vibe, especially with the greasy swamp dudes we meet later in the film. Also, the movie builds some legitimate tension and ups the stakes in amusing ways. It's just also silly and fizzles out.","amazon prime, hooptober, hooptober3.0, nature attacks, written by women",2024-06-30

Ennio Morricone’s contemplative score paints a snow-caked landscape with a sense of dread. Christ on the cross, his head encumbered by a snowdrift. Straight away, you sense an indulgence rare even for Tarantino as we meditate on this wooden cross for 4 minutes before a stagecoach rolls by. The carriage, driven by O.B. Jackson, races against an incoming blizzard as it drives to Red Rock, Wyoming.

Jackson comes across Marquis Warren, horseless and atop three frozen corpses. Warren intends to take the bodies to Red Rock for a reward. Jackson and Warren know they cannot outrun this blizzard, so they mean to hide at a midway point, Minnie’s Haberdashery.

Jackson might accommodate Warren, but the passengers inside may differ. The passenger, a fellow bounty hunter named John Ruth, has handcuffed himself to “Crazy” Daisy Domergue, whom he intends to hang at Red Rock. They cycle through as many racist remarks as they can muster at Warren before allowing him onboard. Domergue speaks once out of turn, and Ruth gives her another punch and bruises to add to the one on her face.

This exchange of Domergue using the n-word and Ruth assaulting her continues a couple more times. Even Warren gets in on the action and assaults Domergue. To remind you that you’re watching a Tarantino movie, Apple Blossom by The White Stripes plays.

And that’s usually when I stop giving a rundown on the movie! We’re twenty minutes in… but go through a similar song-and-dance routine as we meet Chris Mannix. Everyone seems to know everyone by reputation and we hear backstory after backstory. After around 40 minutes, we meet the rest of the eight: Oswaldo Mobray, Joe Gage, and Sanford Smithers.

Everyone has ulterior motives and criminal tendencies, so what we’ve heard is probably a blend of rumors and lies. The remaining two hours of the film are the backstabbing, eliminating, and truth unveiling. Who will be left standing? Why should I care?

Part of what has made Tarantino’s obsession with Sergio Leone fascinating is how he transcribes Western language into non-Western movies. Here, he gives up the ghost and makes a full-blown Western. He also abandons the pretense of action or plot and gives us wall-to-wall Tarantino dialogue.

The movie's stars are Robert Richardson’s cinematography and Ennio Morricone’s score, although the score is underutilized.

Fred Raskin’s editing is fine but lacks the editorial intuition of Sally Menke’s work, which made good Tarantino movies great.

I would not praise a single actor’s performance in this movie. Everyone is hammy and one-note.

The racism and unambiguous misogyny, while in line with the historical period, do nothing but give a certain subset of the viewership something to keep them invested. Yes, Domgergue is a killer, just like the rest of them, but nobody gets the shit beat of them with zero repercussions like her. And thinking up every synonym for the n-word you can muster isn’t creative writing, just like constantly using the word isn’t world-building.

Many people love this movie. I won’t say they’re wrong about it. I’m not fond of Tarantino’s schtick as much as they are. From where I’m sitting, three hours later, this experience sucked.","paramount+, cmc, cmc2024",2024-07-01

Aaron and Dana are true crime podcast hosts. Today, they are at Smith's Grove Psychiatric Hospital to visit with a patient who has been at the facility for 40 years and is being transferred to Glass Hill. They interview Dr. Loomis' protégé, Dr. Ranbir Sartain, who gives a rundown on the various psychological studies done on this patient with no consensus That patient, of course, is notorious serial killer Michael Myers.

Yes, this is an alternate timeline in which Michael went to a psychiatric hospital after his killing spree on the first Halloween. And Laurie Strode still lives in Haddonfield. The podcasters go to interview her. They drive to a high gate and offer her $3000 over the intercom system.
Once inside, they recall Laurie's troubled past — estranged daughter and failed marriages. Laurie takes her money and sends them packing as they tactlessly eviscerate her. Laurie's granddaughter, Allyson, wants a relationship with Laurie, but Laurie has defined her whole life around the murders. Still, they meet with one another. Laurie gives Allyson the $3000 she got from the podcasters.

<b>October 30</b>
Laurie shows up at the prison for the transfer, gun in hand. But she can't bring herself to do what Loomis suggested — kill pure evil. Instead, the bus crashes, and Michael escapes, killing two people and stealing their truck.

<b>October 31</b>
Michael goes after Laurie and Laurie's family.

There isn't much to this movie. It feels referential and flat. Laurie is not a character — she's a first draft. The final 20 minutes is where the film begins, and it's in a way that doesn't suggest two sequels, so I'm curious to see where this goes.","amazon prime, rental, slasher",2024-07-02

In the previous movie, the Strodes trapped Michael in a burning house. But alas, Haddonfield doesn't let houses burn down — they send out a fire department who accidentally set Michael free. And so, we watch Michael brutally murder a bunch of people in sequence.

But Tommy Doyle and a cadre of townspeople hear Michael is on the street. They're bringing frontier justice to Haddonfield.

Reference after reference after reference! And then almost pornographic kills. The tonal dissonance is way too much. This movie has no idea what it is.

The score swells as headlights shamble down a dirt road. Cut to a bright pool setting in the countryside. Bjørn and Louise are on vacation with their daughter, Agnes. A man named Patrick is quite friendly and perhaps a little forward. He and Bjørn continue running into one another. He meets Bjørn's wife, Karin, and their quiet son, Abel. Their families hit it off.

When they return home, Patrick sends a postcard inviting them to stay at their Dutch country home. Things feel weird, but Bjorn is too much of a people-pleaser to leave.

The cinematography stands out most in the landscape shots, which feel expansive yet flat.

The performances are excellent — moving at times in their vulnerability and heart-wrenching in their manipulation.

I find it difficult to understand why the family stays as long as they do. It has something to do with repression and social norms, especially in Danish culture. But I don't have a firm enough grasp on that to argue it.
<blockquote><i>— Why are you doing this?
</i><i>— Because you let me.</i></blockquote>The film has several Biblical allusions, but I'm unsure how it all adds together to say anything.

Pixote is a 10-year-old boy who lives on the street. We don't know his circumstances, only that the police round up him and other children who live on the street and bring them to a juvenile detention center. Some boys say the reformatory is better than being on the streets. But when older boys rape and murder one of the younger boys, the seams come apart, and the corruption within the center comes to light.

We follow Pixote as he navigates his time there — smoking weed, huffing glue, and remaining silent about the cruelty he has witnessed. When he and some others manage to break out, we see the world they have occupied for most of their lives. Is it better or worse than the detention center? Neither are lives that anyone ought to live.

The director set out to make a documentary about the street children of São Paulo, but the reformatory barred him from continuing. So, he collected the stories he heard and witnessed to put together this bleak docudrama.

The performances throughout are tremendous. Fernando Ramos da Silva, who played Pixote, had a similar life to the one he portrayed in the movie. After the success of this film, his illiteracy prevented him from getting more acting work. At 19, the police shot and killed him.

It's hard, then, not to feel like director Héctor Babenco used and disposed of da Silva. Directors of social realist films have since taken more care with their actors — I know of one case where the director subsequently formed a charity that helped thousands of street children.

The ethics of intervention by documentarians is too complex to discuss here. But it's worth mentioning if only to avoid completely vilifying Babenco, who was following in the footsteps of a long documentary tradition.

This heartbreaking film is one of the most unflinching looks at the lives that real people continue to live. While difficult to watch, it also feels essential.","criterion channel, criterion, cc2024, criterion challenge 2024, queer, coming-of-age, solidarity, abraccine 100 melhores",2024-07-05

<b>Haddonfield, Illinois, Halloween Night 2019</b>
Corey Cunningham fills in at the last minute as a babysitter for prank-obsessed Jeremy Allen. Despite Jeremy's parents' request, Corey shows Jeremy The Thing. They joke with each other about how Michael Myers is still out there. Jeremy plays an elaborate prank on Corey. He locks Corey in the attic.  Panicking, Corey kicks the door open, sending Jeremy flying over the banister and down two stories to his death. Jeremy's parents walk in just before Jeremy hits the ground.

Four years after the events of <i>Halloween Kills</i>, Michael Myers vanished. In the grief and paranoia, every accident became intentional, and every murder not immediately explained was blamed on Michael. Laurie moved out of her compound and into a home she shares with her granddaughter, Allyson. Still, she appears at every crime scene, wondering if evil has returned.

Corey works for his dad at a junkyard. Otherwise, he lives a quiet life. After a run-in with some teens, Laurie helps Corey out. They slash the teens' tire. Laurie brings Corey to the doctor where Allyson works. Their lives become entangled as we learn how deep Corey's trauma and problems go.
<blockquote><i>You have to ask yourself, ""Am I in control, or do the elements control me? Life or death. Suicide or cherry blossoms.""</i></blockquote>I don't understand everyone's animosity towards Laurie. They act like she controls Michael or that he wouldn't kill if not for her. Corey's mother believes that Corey became the boogeyman of the town when Michael disappeared. And she blames that on Laure.

It feels like a flimsy parallel they want to draw between Laurie and Allyson. As Allyson falls for Corey,  Laurie recognizes something in him that worries her. Allyson stays with Laurie because she is Laurie's only ally. Corey awakens the anger in her — the desire to burn it all to the ground.
<blockquote><i>Help me. Show me how to do it.</i></blockquote>Moving Michael to the background does wonders for the screenwriters. When they don't have the weight of the franchise on their shoulders, they put together some compelling ideas.

Still, they stretch out the movie with unbearable recapitulation of the same ideas. It's like the writers don't trust themselves to deliver on subtext.

Still, this is the best of the trilogy by far. This movie isn't a massive improvement, but it's much better than the direction <i>Halloween Kills</i> went. Also, a Diana Prince cameo!","amazon prime, rental, hooptober, hooptober2.0, slasher",2024-07-07

An unusual glow permeates through the Irish forest. Adam is a conservationist from England who specializes in trees and fungi. He takes his wife, Claire, and their baby son, Finn, across the Irish Sea to a village surrounded by this forest. There, Adam discovers an unusual fungus growing on the trees. He marks dozens to bring down.

While exploring the woods, they find an abandoned house that the forest has reclaimed in parts. Their dog, Iggy, barks when he spots a dead fawn. Cavities have burst open along the animal where the same fungus has protruded. Adam takes a sample home to study further.

Back home, Claire pulls iron bars off the windows. Colm Donnelly, a local wary of Adam, warns Claire that the forest is dangerous. That night, a window breaks in the baby's room. Adam assumes Colm, but the police suggest a bird. More pointedly, he reminds Adam that folks are superstitious around here. They believe the forest Adam tramples on belongs to the Hallow: baby-stealing fae.

The film follows Adam and his family as they learn the forest's secrets. Will they heed the village's many warnings?

The filmmaking here is excellent, especially for a first-time director. The lighting doesn't rely on darkness to set the mood — a brightly lit night shot can have just as much creepy atmosphere. The practical effects are crucial in selling creatures integrated with their surroundings.

The movie has more than a few nods to <i>Alien</i>, <i>The Thing</i>, and the like. I'm not mad about it.

The film's greatest foil is that it reveals everything early into the movie, so it becomes more of a survival film than anything. Also, this isn't a big-budget flick, so CGI is inevitable for some more ambitious scenes.

While not a great film, it is a promising one. Director Corin Hardy's follow-up to this was <i>The Nun</i>, which received pretty negative reviews, so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Night falls as Elizabeth Marcus arrives at a cabin overlooking Crystal Lake. She turns on the light, and the lightbulb melts and explodes. After replacing it, she goes to the bathroom to take a shower. Just before she steps in, the power goes out… again. She dons a towel. The front door swings open. There he is — Jason.

She runs outside, effortlessly leaping over cars and limbs. She stops at a clearing, looking around. Jason raises his machete. A row of spotlights cut on. A swat team emerges from the shadows and fills Jason full of lead. To make damn sure, they drop a mortar on him, blowing him to smithereens. The team congratulates FBI Agent Marcus for her work of luring out Jason.

<b>Federal Morgue, Youngstown, Ohio</b>
The coroner performs an autopsy on Jason's body, commenting on the hundreds of bullets and whatnot. The heart, in particular, interests him, as an unusual black liquid fills it. Oh, and it's still beating. The rhythmic beats take over the coroner. He takes a bite out of the heart. Whatever possessed Jason has moved into him. He murders his fellow coroner and anyone who insults Jason.

This film is the first Jason movie from New Line Cinemas — hence, the lack of a ""Friday the 13th"" in the title. The failure of Jason Takes Manhattan allowed them to purchase the rights. They wanted to do a Freddy vs. Jason movie, that went into development hell when Wes Craven returned to do <i>New Nightmare</i>. So, they put together a couple of movies: this and <i>Jason X</i>.

Jason fans weren't ready for a tongue-in-cheek take on their beloved slasher. This movie is hilarious, and intentionally so. Several scenes play into the slasher cliches, not quite subverting them but highlighting the absurdity. The coroner, as Jason, tying the guy down, shaving him, and then possessing him is such a silly choice.

It also expands on the lore the previous movies never agreed on. It doesn't make total sense, but neither has the series up to this point. The Evil Dead tie-in and the suggestion that Jason is a deadite might be the most controversial.

The cynical cultural remarks remind me of <i>Texas Chainsaw II</i> — everything is exploitable for a buck, especially when you have a secret recipe.

For bounty hunter Creighton Duke (played by the always delightful Steven Williams), his secret sauce is the way to stop Jason once and for all.

Some of the plotting is pretty tedious, especially when mistaken identity comes into play. Thankfully, it merges into place for the third act.

Though the gore is hit-or-miss, its hits are wild and make up the difference.

I wouldn't call this a hidden masterpiece, but it's underappreciated. If you love slashers, you might hate this. But if you can stomach some genre fuckery, this one is a lot of fun.","hooptober, hooptober2.0, slasher",2024-07-08

It’s morning in Taipei City. Jim and Kat lay in bed together. They had planned a trip together, but Jim forgot and scheduled a meeting with a German ad agency. He intends to speak with his boss and skip it.

While eating a leftover baozi with sweet chili sauce, Jim watches a YouTube video discussing the Alvin virus. The government and most citizens don’t take it seriously, comparing it to a mild flu. However, several medical experts see the potential for the disease to mutate into something more deadly, citing the similarities in the protein structures of it and rabies.

Outside, Jim sees a gray-haired woman in a white gown standing on the roof. He calls out to see if she’s alright. When she turns around, blood has splattered across her gown and her eyes are dark with red rings around them. Jim’s neighbor, Mr. Lin, comes outside with sniffles, claiming the virus is a hoax. When Jim’s attention returns to the other roof, the woman has disappeared.

Jim takes Kat to the train station on his motorcycle. They pass a crime scene where the police pin down a red-eyed man and a bloodied sheet covers a body on a gurney. Jim offers to cook for Kat that night when she gets home from work. Passing the crime scene again, he sees an abandoned police car with the lights still on.

Jim goes to his regular cafe to get a coffee. While he waits, the woman he saw earlier enters the store. A customer checks on her. She turns around and spits a thick mucus on his face. She turns around, grabs the basket where fries are cooking, and pours it over the employee’s head. The hot oil melts his face. She pulls the skin from his face with intense fascination. Jim stops her only to notice that the customer she spat on has pinned his friend down and stabs his friend repeatedly in the neck.

When Jim runs outside, he notices the same black eyes and frenzied looks on several people. The infection has mutated. Can Jim escape? Will Kat be okay? Will they be able to reunite amidst the unfolding chaos?

This movie is brutal! It has a warning beforehand letting you know how graphic it will be, and I appreciate it. Though CGI assists in some more dangerous stunts, the effects look mostly practical. It’s not realistic — they’re going for over-the-top shock over groundedness.

The film holds up several forms of predatory behavior next to each other, some more subtle than others. What is the difference between a man who won’t leave a woman alone on a train vs. one who chases her down with an axe? One makes their intentions clearer, but both act on a sense of entitlement to the woman.

In that way, this film comes across as quite misanthropic — who can you trust when everyone is out to get you? But the pandemic breaks out the way it does BECAUSE of a lack of trust. By assuming the worst intentions in people, a disease shows the worst in people. Our isolation and our inability to communicate turn the world into monsters.

The score also hits pretty hard, opting to only go big at pivotal moments.

Plenty of people believe that the organizing principles of civilization are the only things keeping people from raping and killing as they please. This movie shows that it wouldn’t take much to fall apart. Things are pretty shit, but not THIS shit.","shudder, hooptober, hooptober2.0, zombies",2024-07-08

I read the manga earlier this year. While I didn’t love it, it had some memorable images. I was curious to see how the movie would translate the episodic nature of the manga into a full-length movie.

The film carefully reconstructs the frames of Junji Ito’s manga, bringing it to life in a studied but lively way. The actors have trouble making the dialogue work. Or the director wanted them to sound stilted and off. Also, the film has a hard time doing much beyond recreating the unusual atmosphere.

The film has a low-budget feel, or rather, a television-budget feel. It makes sense with Akihiro Higuchi’s TV background.

It’s hard to talk about. There isn’t much to it. The manga is similarly empty but has a lot more internal monologue. The movie cuts out almost all the monologue and most of the book. It tries to improve on the total lack of an ending in the manga. Instead, it just cuts earlier in the story, leaving it feeling even more unresolved.

Kenneth Magee, a writer, touches down in the UK, meeting up with his publisher, Sam Allyson, for lunch. Kenneth sees a woman across the dining hall. Sam suggests love at first sight, but Kenneth doesn’t believe in such things. Sam pushes Kenneth to develop his talents and branch out into more passionate territory. Kenneth believes anyone could write a novel on par with Wuthering Heights nowadays. So much so that he makes a $20 thousand bet that, given a night in an isolated, atmospheric locale, he could write said novel in 24 hours. Sam suggests the old, abandoned Bllyddpaetwr Manor in Wales.

It’s pronounced bald-patter, but Kenneth and Sam say bald-pate. Hilarity ensues?

Sam drives out to the manor, the stormy weather growing drearier as he draws closer. He pulls up to a Tudor-style Victorian manor with castle-like turrets. The inside is dark and cobwebbed, with sheets covering the furniture, banister, and statues. He sets up shop in a bedroom and works on his novel, Midnight Manor.

As he types, he feels an unease. He lights more candles around the room. At one end, in front of a faded tapestry, he finds a washbowl and pitcher full of water. He pulls back the comforter on the bed and discovers fresh linens on the pillows. Outside, on the floor below, he sees the outline of a figure enter a lit room and close the door. Upon inspection, he finds the manor occupied by Elijah and Victoria Quimby, caretakers for the manor.

Before Kenneth can dig further, another woman shows up — the woman he saw at his hotel. She tells Kenneth that he is in grave danger and must leave with her. She suggests a terrorist organization, but Kenneth doesn’t buy it. He overhears her call Sam, and she mentions the caretakers. But Sam informs her that there are no caretakers.

The film has a classic horror structure. Perhaps it comes from the 1913 play on which they based this movie. This is the seventh film adaptation, excluding theater, TV, and radio adaptations. So it makes sense that several critics found this adaptation “unnecessary.” I’ve seen none of them, nor has anyone recommended them.

I watched this because Vincent Price, Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing, and Jon Carradine are in it together, and this is the only time they were ever in a movie together. It’s nice to see them, even though they have little to do.

I haven’t seen Desi Arnaz, Jr. in anything — he has a classic charm and handsomeness that make up for his meh acting skills. 

The movie is delightful for Hammer and classic horror fans. It takes an hour before the plot commences, but the atmosphere is satisfying. I wouldn’t venture to watch this unless inclined before my mention of it.","tubi, hooptober, hooptober2.0, britsploitation, haunted house",2024-07-09

Alberto Baldan Bembo’s lush orchestral score opens the film, telling you how Italian and 70s this movie will be.

Conrad von Stark drives through Northern Germany, listening to a tape of a war crimes trial. It details the rape, torture, and executions that a former prisoner of the camp experienced. He arrives at the ruins of the death camp, where he meets with Lise Cohen. Conrad did prison time for his crimes at the camp and is now free. Lise was a former prisoner of the camp. Her testimony saved his life.

<blockquote><i>I was just a soldier. I only followed orders. I was doing my duty.</i></blockquote>We flashback to their time in the camp, the games they played, and Lise’s strength, which Conrad did all he could to break. He did far more than follow orders.

For this cult movie category, I chose this movie because it’s on the Video Nasties list since I’ve committed to watching all of those for some stupid reason. Impressively, the UK still won’t allow a DVD release for this movie.

From a filmmaking perspective, the film is well-assembled, with selective cuts at the most grotesque moments. Not tasteful, mind you — just smartly letting the imagination perform what the budget might not.

Daniela Poggi has since voiced her regret for being in this movie, citing being young and pressured by her team. This remains one of her most popular films, as most of her work never broke out of Italy.

<b>Liège, Belgium</b>
Henry Brogan is a 51-year-old sniper who works for the DIA. He’s in Belgium to assassinate a terrorist aboard a train. Everything goes smoothly until a young girl approaches the target. Because of the wait, Henry hits the target in the neck — still lethal, but not his intent. His spotter captures it on his phone, which disgusts Henry.

<b>Buttermilk Sound, Georgia, USA</b>
Henry meets with colleague Del Patterson at Henry’s home, announcing his retirement after the “sloppy” shot. He rents a boat from a new manager named Danny. He takes a boat out to meet with Jack on his yacht. Jack shows Henry information that suggests his target in Belgium was innocent. Henry demands a meeting with the informant and chastises Jack for contacting him.

Of course, the DIA is keeping tabs on Henry, and they capture the conversation with a satellite. Or, you know, Jack’s in on it. Either way, the agency director declares Henry a rogue. Clay Verris, a private military contractor, demands they use Gemini since no one else can take out Henry. The director denies him the opportunity.

On his way back, Henry finds a bug on his boat. The only one who could have put it there is Danny, though she denies it. That is until he produces her credentials. They bond until Henry realizes assassins have killed Jack and Henry’s spotter. He grabs Danny and they escape.

It looks like Gemini is on the table, after all. Clay sends out his top assassin. And he bears an uncanny resemblance to Henry.

I watched the 60 FPS version since people seem to like it. It seems to hide the seams of the de-aging work okay — the CGI stunts: not so much. But I watch movies with shitty FX all the time, so I don’t care. It looks like they did some de-aging or something to Clive Owen — he looks indeterminately uncanny valley.

Mary Elizabeth Winstead is a total badass who saves this movie. Will Smith does everything possible to turn off the charisma that made him famous. I suppose the younger self is flat to make the de-aging easier, but as his older self, it’s frustrating.

The action sequences are okay, playing closer to silly fun over grounded. The goopy, stretchy fight sequences between the Wills resemble Neo vs. the 1000s of Agent Smiths.

The film explores similar themes to <i>Civil War</i> — the remorse of the old guard vs. the thirst of the new. It feels like Ang Lee is contemplating what will replace him. Since <i>Life of Pi</i>, Ang Lee has prioritized tech over the story, and his movies have suffered.

I can’t play contrarian and act like this is secretly brilliant. Some folks praise any movie that takes a creative risk because they want to encourage Hollywood to take chances. It’s hard to call an action movie starring Will Smith a chance as much as déjà vu.

Isabelle and Vincent have sex. She cannot orgasm but encourages Vincent to go ahead. Dismayed, Vincent questions if she could more easily orgasm with her previous partner. The question causes her to cry and push Vincent away. He apologizes but must still dress and leave Isabelle, promising to call over the weekend.

She passes a fish vendor. He espouses the way we cannot satisfy all our desires at once. We seek satisfaction in various ways, but it never works in totality.

After a weekend without calls, Isabelle visits Vincent, professing her love for him and asking for some attention. But Vincent is married and cannot call when he pleases. 

When they go out, Vincent is terse with the server and mentions an opportunity with her ex-husband's ex-lover to have her art displayed. He tells her there must be a man in Paris who can love her the way she deserves. He finds Isabelle charming. But his wife is extraordinary.

Isabelle has had enough of being a ""backstreet lover"" and declares her desire to find love. The film follows her journey as she deals with all the trials of dating in her 50s.

The film is casual and effortless as it moves from scene to scene. Denis is not afraid to let romance adorn moments — an optimism I've yet to experience in her movies prior.

For what romance we see, however, Isabelle is not easily charmed. She does not want to waste time on empty words. She wants naked vulnerability. People of any age don't hand that out freely. But she is human, and she also wants physical intimacy. People seem equipped to dole that out, even when there's someone at home.

When in doubt, she asks folks how they're doing to see if it's just her who isn't doing so great. If they're doing well, then maybe she will, too, someday.

The actor has trouble finding words, wishing Isabelle would feed them to him. But the heart doesn't have a prewritten script. The ex is familiar but has all the same flaws that broke them apart. The fuckboi will always be at the ready to disappoint her again.

Does Juliette Binoche ever disappoint?

The episodic quality leaves the movie with little momentum, making it difficult to stay invested. We get vignettes more than arcs. 

The film might not have anything grand to say about love. But it does give hope to a single gal like me that, even if I don't find love today, it may still be out there.<blockquote><i>Stop getting yourself all in a stew. It serves no purpose whatsoever.

A teenage boy named Tim has nightmares in his bed. Sweating and convulsing, he sees men in hooded cloaks torturing a woman to force a confession. His shouting wakes his grandmother, Agatha, who checks on him and finds his bed empty.

Mandy and Roy sit by a campfire, camping by a lake in a rock quarry. Eyes watch them from a rundown shack. Mandy wants to leave, so Roy uses some tunes to lighten the mood. While he steps away, Mandy sneaks into the shack to jump out and scare Roy. Roy calls for her, and she screams. He enters the shack to find Mandy’s bloodied body. Unseen hands drive a nail-ridden board into Roy’s face.

Tim rushes inside the house and jumps into bed, jeans and Member’s Only jacket still on. Agatha emerges from the shadows to question Tim on his whereabouts. He details his nightmare, the same one he has night after night.

The following day, a man snorkeling at the quarry discovers Roy’s dead body. Sheriff Hank Walden calls Dr. Sam Cordell to inform him about Roy’s murder and Mandy’s rape. He arrives at the hospital OR to find local reporter Laura Kincaid crassly photographing the scene, with Mandy’s parents embracing in tears and Sam filled with quintessential Cassavetes rage.

The local library/museum depicts a similar torture scene to the one in Tim’s nightmares. While closing the building, someone rapes and murders the librarian, Carolyn. Who is doing this? How do Tim’s visions tie in? Why is Sam so dodgy around reporters?

Cassavetes had a hand in the script, giving it a more human quality. I usually have a problem when movies don’t give anyone’s names. This movie has the opposite problem — every person on-screen gets a name, so it’s hard to tell who is important and who is just there.

The film does not mince details regarding the horrendous rapes. The filmmakers don’t show them, but the doctors provide more than enough details. They use slow motion during the kills, which reminds me of Lynch.

This whole movie has <i>Twin Peaks</i> vibes. It’s more overt and explainable, but it’s still weird. All the subplots would be solid fodder for a TV pilot, but they add so much noise.

Despite how messy this is, it’s such a fascinating watch. I would only recommend this to horror fans so they can see how usual this movie is.

<blockquote><i>— Are you sure this is the way?
— Every road leads somewhere.
— What about a dead end?</i></blockquote>In 1987, Abbas Kiarostami made one of my favorite movies, <i>Where Is the Friend’s House?</i> In 1990, an earthquake in Iran killed nearly 50 thousand people. This film is a partially fictionalized rendering of Kiarostami returning to Koker, where he filmed <i>Where Is the Friend’s House?</i>

In this film, a film director (Farhad Kheradmand) travels to Koker with his son, Pouya (Pouya Payvar, son of cinematographer Homayun Payvar) to look for Babak Ahmadpour, who played Ahmad in <i>Where Is the Friend’s House?</i>

Because of the earthquake, the usual highway to Koker is closed. So, the director and his son must ask locals for directions, mirroring Ahmad’s actions in <i>Friend’s House</i>, where he asks for directions to Mohammad Reza’s home. Also like Ahmad, people give him side quests and chores, but many do not know what he asks.

The filmmakers capture the movie in the style of a road documentary, with handheld shots of passing landscapes, some from <i>Friend’s House</i>, rendered new in the less formal style. The two actors interact with real people, not characters, and move through the very real wreckage the earthquake left. Pouya asks a man whose shop is in shambles if he has any sodas. The man replies, “What a thing to ask at a time like this.”

Like <i>Friend’s House</i> and the later <i>Taste of Cherry</i>, the camera will pull back to such immense degrees that the characters are barely visible in the landscape. Sometimes, it creates echoes and mirrors from <i>Friend’s House</i>. Other times, it reminds us of how massive the effect of the earthquake was on the land itself. Also, like <i>Taste of Cherry</i> and many of Kiarostami’s later films, the car is the central location of discussion, reflection, and progression.

The earthquake is a reset and a reminder. Much of these people’s world as they knew it fell apart. But what remains are the people who lived, their stories as witnesses, and their lives beyond it. They are not only survivors, but soccer fans, husbands and wives, believers in God, and all the other identities we carry with us. How you see and present yourself are the legacies you leave behind.

Similarly the director, as a character, does not extend beyond the frame. When the movie ends, so does he. In searching for the actors, they search for a legacy outside the frame. You, who were there during the filming — who lived through this earthquake — still exist and are more than the film.

By design, we don’t know if the director and his son will arrive in Koker, let alone find the actors. More than anything, this reveals Kiarostami’s faith in film to arrive somewhere, even if it’s a dead end. Like the director says when someone tells him his car won’t make it, “We’ll see how it goes.”


<blockquote><i>— Do you think you are blessed?
— Those are just words.
— Then how do you explain it?
— The way I see it, this disaster fell upon us like a hungry wolf. Those in its path were devoured while the rest were spared. No, this wasn’t God’s doing.</i></blockquote>I don’t want to dig too deep into the individual moments, because I don’t want to take away from the sense of discovery that makes this movie so beautiful.

Is this film more pastiche than genre? Perhaps, but that fits into the design. While the film has obvious 80s touches, like VHS noise and a synthpop soundtrack, it also invests in the small touches that would make Tarantino cream his jeans. And they aren’t just for, “Hey, this is the 80s.” They play into the plot, the characters' development, and how Maxine sees herself.

This movie won’t be for everyone, but if you enjoyed <i>X</i> and <i>Pearl</i>, I see no reason you won’t appreciate this. <i>Pearl</i> is still the best film of the three, but I can't deny the fun of watching such a lovingly made action slasher.","amc southpoint, good for her",2024-07-11

<blockquote><i>Why do you all come out here to die? What is wrong with you?</i></blockquote>A woman in a fine dining restaurant eats soup. Her spoon draws out what looks like a head. She pulls out the rest of the creature. The movie converts to claymation as she screams. When the monster with angel wings comes to life, it falls in love with her convulsing uvula and rips it out of her throat.

We watch a lengthy cycle of “thing kills thing” until a crow flies over Jinpei Katakuri and shits on his head, turning the film back into live-action. Masao kills the bird and sics Pochi, their dog, to fetch it. Yurie, his great-granddaughter, watches while burying a dead goldfish and wonders, “What makes a happy family?”

Yurie explains how Masao, her grandfather, was a shoe salesperson. The company laid him off, so he used his redundancy pay to purchase an old house. He intends to turn it into a bed-and-breakfast in anticipation of the highway expanding to the house. She then goes over each family member’s failure that led to them working at the bed-and-breakfast.

They haven’t expanded the highway, so the house has no guests. The film details that summer at the bed-and-breakfast as the family looks for happiness and all the guests die mysterious deaths.

The film is a genre-bending collection of ideas — a surrealist farce, a musical comedy, a family melodrama, and so on. It’s also a loose remake of The Quiet Family, a movie I haven’t seen.

Because the movie is so scattershot, some moments had me dying laughing and other parts had me impatiently tapping my fingers. I wish this were, like, 30 minutes shorter.

<b>Dumplings (Fruit Chan) ****</b>
<blockquote><i>Northerners always say, “Good feelings come from a nap. Good taste comes from a dumpling.”</i></blockquote>Mrs. Li takes a car to a poorer neighborhood in Hong Kong. With her elegant red dress and designer sunglasses, she could not stand out more. She rings the bell of an apartment with barred windows and a gated front door.

There, Mrs. Li meets Aunt Mei, known for her expensive dumplings. Mei recognizes Mrs. Li from TV, though she hasn’t acted in some years. Mrs. Li guesses Mei is in her thirties, but Mei claims to be much older. Her secret? The dumplings.

Mei uses the best ingredients — high gluten flour kneaded to the perfect thickness, freshly chopped cabbage, and a translucent red and pink protein. If Mrs. Li were to learn what it was, would it stop her from eating them? How much would she do to achieve youthful beauty?

The meditation on the cooking process reminds me of Studio Ghibli, but the ominous music and unusual filling add a sinister edge.

Fruit Chan and screenwriter Lilian Lee based this story on an HK exposé on notorious underground markets, and Chan’s personal experience. I can’t talk about much more without spoiling the story.

A woman consumes a frozen man’s blood. Her phone rings, so she removes her metal fangs to answer. She sits down to play the piano. Her stomach doesn’t agree with her meal, so she collapses on the floor, the piano still playing, and vomits up blood.

The camera pulls back to reveal a movie set and crew filming the whole thing. The director walks backstage, answering crew questions, and belittles an actor in drag. He gives a coworker a ride to Seoul before returning to his elaborate mansion. Someone knocks him out.

When he wakes, he finds a man putting his wife into an elaborate trap. The man is connected to the director’s life. Is the director able to fulfill the man’s request?

This short excels mostly in its aesthetics — the color, costumes, and sets are all immaculate and considered. I missed something because we go to the director's house but he wakes up on the set from earlier. The camera makes no pretense of hiding it — he even goes backstage at one point.

Japan in winter is so gorgeous, so the exteriors are effortlessly breathtaking. But the images that Miike assembles are so striking. The subjectivity of the experience is disorienting but comes together eloquently.

Insiang, Tonya's daughter, crosses a footbridge carrying a runny sack of clothes. She does laundry and delivery services. Living with Tonya and Insiang is Tonya's sister-in-law and her family — a dozen children and grandchildren. Still, Tonya chastises them for moving to the city when jobs are scarce.

Edong asks Insiang if her employer, Mrs. Flores, has any job openings. Tonya has been harsh on Edong for being unemployed. But Insiang is well aware of Tonya's sharp tongue — she receives the brunt of Tonya's misery. Though Insiang has committed to putting up with her condition, Edong wonders how long they can handle this desperation.

Edong has friends with jobs who still can't make it work. They sit outside the shops, drinking liquor and making passes at the young women who pass. Edong jumps in, groping the shop owner's daughter. The shop owner chases him down and creates a scene that Tonya witnesses. This drives Tonya to kick her sister-in-law's family out. She even strips the youngest of the clothes lent to them, sending them naked down the street.

Dado, Tonya's much younger boyfriend, makes passes at Insiang. She pushes him away easily enough. But when Tonya moves Dado into the house, his violent and controlling tendencies change Insiang's life for the worse. She is no longer content with putting up with her condition.

The film is a relentless look at urban poverty in the Philippines. So much so that President Ferdinand Marcos halted its release and put it through rigorous censorship. Marcos' daughter, Imee, however, was a principal sponsor. With her help and public protest, the censors lifted the ban.

Hilda Koronel gives a grounded and nuanced performance. It's clear why Lino Brocka put her in so many of his movies. Not everyone matches her, but no one is so bad that it deters from the movie. Mona Lisa also crushes it, both in her performance and choice of stage name.

While the film has a social realist core, the story is melodramatic, bordering on exploitation. In the wrong hands, this movie could have turned out differently. I'm still on the fence about a couple of choices, but I understand them in the context of Insiang's trajectory.

This film is heartbreaking and bleak. We, the audience, experience some catharsis, but no happy ending. Cruelty begets cruelty.","criterion channel, criterion, criterion challenge 2022, cc2022, solidarity, rape and revenge",2024-07-12

A couple of days pass and Yumi receives a call from Yoko. Yoko repeats what they heard in the message unwittingly. Then, just like the call, Yoko turns and screams. Something pushes her off the bridge and onto the top of a passing train. Her disembodied hand continues to dial numbers.

Yuri visits Yoko’s apartment to investigate. She meets some girls living in the building who also had a friend who died similarly — she received a call from the time she died. They believe what the girl had passed on to Yoko.

Hideo Yamamoto has been Miike’s cinematographer for his best-looking movies. This movie is no exception. The writing is super dull, and I blame Akimoto’s book, on which they based this movie and the US franchise. Why adapt a record producer’s book? Who knows?

About halfway through is a live broadcast about the occurrences. It has Late Night With the Devil vibes and brings a brief jolt of life to the movie. The movie would be a blast if it kept up that baroque insanity.

A baby tooth sinks to the bottom of a glass of water under an orchestral cover of The Stranglers' ""Golden Brown.""

It's Tuesday morning. Milla is at the train station in her school uniform. A feral man named Moses pushes past her and nearly collides with the train. Her nose bleeds, so he drags her to the ground, takes off his shirt, and holds it to her nose. He tells her he's been evicted and needs money. She offers him 50, but he has to do something for her.

Moses gives Milla a haircut — shave on the sides, just like his — before introducing him to Henry and Anna, her parents. Milla is 16, and Moses is 23. Anna has taken too much Xanax and Zoloft, as well as some blue things. Henry is just happy Milla is home and safe. Anna freaks and Moses leaves, 50 in hand.

It's at this point that the movie gives us a hint at why Milla's parents are so permissive. Milla had cancer and is in remission. But things get messier when, one night, Anna catches Moses robbing them and taking prescription drugs. Milla comes in, hair has fallen out. She's had a remission and is getting chemo again. Henry wants to call the police — but when they realize how happy Moses makes Milla, they back off.

<blockquote><i>This is the worst possible parenting I can imagine.</i></blockquote>
In case it isn't clear, this movie is hilarious. It's a sense of humor for which you're either on board or will only sour the experience.

It helps to have Ben Mendelsohn and Essie Davis, who are tremendous actors. Eliza Scanlen proved she could play an unpredictable teenager in <i>Sharp Objects</i>. Toby Wallace is convincing as an Aussie pillhead, and gives a remarkable performance.

Moses and Milla have that classic avoidant/anxious attachment style. Moses comes and goes as he pleases. Milla is hooked on his mysterious ways and wants, more than anything, for him to stay near her.

The film also follows Henry's fixation on a pregnant woman named Toby. Henry, a psychiatrist, needs to fix people. Her prescribes all sorts of drugs for Anna that don't seem to help. His daughter is dying and falling for a drug addict, and there's nothing he can do about it. In a world where everyone's problems are not easily solvable, Toby needs someone to change a lightbulb.

This script has all the trademarks of a ""quirky indie comedy-drama,"" but Shannon Murphy's direction smooths out many quirks. Not all of it — Milla is sometimes wacky for the sake of it, and the movie doesn't care too much about what pill addiction looks like — but enough to keep this from being a cloying disaster.

It also helps that the dynamics at play make some sense to me. My younger half-sister was born with a physical disability that made one side of her body significantly weaker than the other. My mother was permissive with her because of it and because my sister was the only daughter she had. So, when my sister met a boy seven years her senior, she was worried but also relieved that my sister could meet and fall in love with someone. It helps that he isn't a drug addict, at least to my knowledge.

From the outside, you wonder what the hell my mom is thinking. But when you grow up with a daughter full of love and misery, you don't want to take away that chance at happiness.

My projection is probably making the movie better than it is. Also, my love of Aussie/Kiwi accents probably obscured some glaring flaws. But this movie charmed my pants off. Is that a phrase? It charmed me and got right under my skin.

Also, the soundtrack fucking rules. Tune-Yards followed by Donnie & Joe Emerson? And ""Just Another Diamond Day"" by Vashti Bunyan?? Fuck off.","amc+, acc2024, anti-criterion challenge 2024, good for her, coming-of-age, directed by women, written by women",2024-07-14

<blockquote><i>There was a time when being a man meant being yakuza. Me, my life was like lukewarm water. Then, I met him.</i></blockquote>Yakuza boss Kamiura takes a samurai blade through a rival gang's hideout. Hacked and slashed to bits, he makes it through. The boss shoots him several times. Though faltering, Kamiura continues. Three men take turns stabbing him in the chest, but he persists, killing them and the boss.

Kamiura makes his way to his girlfriend's place. She holds him for a bit before he pulls back her hair. He bites her neck and drinks her blood.

Cut to a bathhouse, where Kageyama observes Kamiura bathing, wound-free and smiling. The boss is benevolent and looks out for people in the town, even during a recession. Kageyama aspires to be like him. He especially likes the boss' sick full-back tattoo.

One night, Kamiura takes Kageyama to a tea house. But this is no ordinary tea house — to the right client, the tea house serves the blood of criminals. Kamiura offers some to Kageyama, who gladly accepts it.

We vibe with the yakuza for, like, 15 minutes. Then, a priest walks into town like we're in a dang old western — our clue to how we should watch this movie. And, you know, the whistle score with breakbeats behind it.

Kamiura warns the priest for returning despite his ban from the town. A fight ensues, and Kageyama comes to the boss' defense. The priest produces a gun that shoots electricity into Kamiura. The priest's associate twists Kamiura's head off and draws blood from the body.

Kageyama sees that one of his associates has betrayed them before the priest shoots him. When he comes to, he holds Kamiura's head in mourning. The head comes to life and bites Kageyama's neck.
<blockquote><i>Drink of my blood and become a yakuza vampire!</i></blockquote>Kageyama feels a new sensation as a tattoo appears on his back — the same one his boss had. How will Kageyama handle his new vampirism? Not well!

Miike knows that if you are going to do vampire shit, it has to be at least a little gay. I could have used a lot more, though.

Also, I love a vampire who uses his power for good (relatively speaking). 

In addition to vampires, we also get kappas. In Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III, where they travel to the Edo period, everyone thinks the turtles are kappas. Although here, they are much sillier and humanoid.

The movie fluctuates from impossibly quiet to Miike-silly. As it progresses, it gets sillier, which at least keeps it interesting. If set pieces were the only thing a movie needed, we'd have a classic. But the plot devolves into nonsense and doesn't resolve. Like, at all.
<blockquote><i>Sometimes, yakuza just gotta go wild.</i></blockquote>I want to know what Japanese word they translated to ""crapola.""

I am once again asking Miike to cut 30 minutes from his movies. I laughed a few times, but I was ready for this to end well before the frog yuru-kyara appeared. The final fight is funny, especially for how much build-up it gets, but it just feels like Miike is fucking with the audience at this point.","tubi, hooptober, hooptober2.0, j-horror, yakuza",2024-07-14

<blockquote><i>In June 1974, Drs. F. Sherwood Rowland and Mario Molina of the University of California startled the scientific world with their finding that fluorocarbon gases used in aerosol spray cans are seriously damaging the Earth's protective ozone layer. Thus, potentially dangerous amounts of ultraviolet rays are reaching the surface of our planet, adversely affecting all living things. This motion picture dramatizes what COULD happen in the near future IF we continue to do nothing to stop the damage to Nature's protective shield for life on this planet.</i></blockquote>Steve Buckner leads a group of tourists in Northern California on a hike. Only he and Santee, the Native American assistant, know how to survive the wilderness.

Before they head out, the sheriff warns Steve that several weird accidents have occurred this week. He doesn't stop Steve or anything — he just wants Steve to know that he is mucking about in God's Domain. A hawk from up high comes down to scree and confirm the sheriff's concerns.

Nevertheless, they persist. So when the wild animals descend the mountain to escape the sun's rays, Santee is the first to notice the absence of their sound. Then, all at once, assorted birds descend on the group. Ladies and gentlemen, we have a <i>Birds</i> on our hands.

But it gets worse. The hikers come across a campsite that appears abandoned, the campfire is still burning. And that night, at their camp, a wolf attacks.

With no way out except to get to the end, will these folks make it alive? Probably not, right?

After the success of <i>Grizzly</i>, the team reassembled to make this unambiguous eco-warning film. Weirdly, I like this a little bit more. I guess it's because it's not so obviously a <i>Jaws</i> rip-off as <i>Grizzly</i> is.

If you missed the opening crawl, where they tell you how crucial the ozone layer is, don't worry — the movie will recapitulate this several times. The science of the movie is suspect at best. The film suggests that the sun will get hot one day and all at once the animals will...?

Leslie Nielsen's character says the most out-of-pocket racist shit throughout. He also tries to rape one of the other hikers?! So, you know some animals are going to murder the fucker. When he's not doing awful shit, his performance is so unhinged that it's entertaining.

I can't say this was a good time, but I appreciate how much animals wreaking havoc we get.

Cold open on Miyuki Goto and Kosuke Hasegawa fucking. It’s important to know that these two fuck. And they both like to fuck each other. The ice blue lighting reminds me of the Game Boy Pocket I had in the same color.

The camera takes voyeuristic positions as we watch Miyuki do her laundry — through a spyhole, outside her window. From the upstairs balcony, we watch her read over the script for a play she’s in, based on the most famous Kaidan of all time, Yotsuya Kaidan. Watch <a href=""https://boxd.it/3NSFCj""><i>The Ghost of Yotsuya</i></a>, also an adaptation of Yotsuya Kaidan — it rules. 
Anyway, back to this movie. Kosuke comes to Miyuki’s rehearsals. Miyuki, a famous actress playing the lead, Oiwa, pulls some strings and gets Kosuke cast as Iemon. As they perform the play, the world of the play becomes more realistic. The elements of the actor’s life blur into the play and vice versa.

<blockquote><i>Sometimes, I wish the play were my real life.</i></blockquote>

With films like <i>The Girls</i> and <i>Millenium Actress</i> in the world, a movie about stage life and real-life blurring needs more than the premise itself to attract. So, in classic Miike form, we get visceral gore, but not until an hour in.

The pace will be slow for most audiences. I can deal with a slow burn if it keeps the tension taught. This one takes a long time to build up, but it builds.

I’m not sure why I watched this movie of Miike’s. I made this list ages ago, and there are more popular horror movies in his filmography. Still, I enjoyed this one more than some of the others that I have watched. It helps that this is 94 minutes. 

The version of Tubi is dubbed, and poorly so at that, which may have contributed to my liking this less than others. The last 15 minutes are incredible visually, so dubbing doesn't ruin that.

Kingo Gondo is a board member of a company called National Shoes. He meets with his fellow board of directors to discuss the company's future. Currently, their profits have flat-lined. Some on the board want to produce cheaper shoes that wear out faster and increase profits. Gondo wishes to invest in high-quality, modern shoes — a short-term profit loss for a theoretical long-term gain as the company sustains its reputation.

Little do the other board members know, Gondo has a plan. A phone call comes in from the Osaka Hotel. Everything is in place. He'll send the deposit of ¥50 million after it's done. Where did he get that money? He borrowed against everything he owned, including his family's house. For the rest he owes, he'll take over the company with a leveraged buyout.

What is this, an episode of <i>Succession</i>?

While all this is happening, Gondo's wife, Reiko, enters with their son, Jun, and Shinichi, the child of Gondo's chauffeur. The boys go outside to play cowboys. Gondo tells Jun to shoot to kill. Reiko worries about his focus on success — that it's taking away from his humanity.

Gondo's chauffeur comes in looking for Shinichi. Gondo receives a call that they have kidnapped Jun. They are holding him for ransom for ¥30 million. Gondo agrees to get him back, whatever the cost. But then, Jun walks in, unbothered. Gondo dismisses it, but they realize Shinichi is missing. The kidnappers took Shinichi by mistake.

Still, the kidnappers do not relent. If he doesn't pay, the boy dies. The film follows Gondo as he weighs his choices: pay the ransom to save Shinichi or complete the buyout. One might cost him his wealth and identity. The other might cost him his soul.

Of course, it's more nuanced than that, which is why the movie works.

I held on to every word of this movie! This script is impeccable! Like <i>12 Angry Men</i>, we watch the case develop piece by piece.

They built the script around Japan's then penal code, which stated it's only extortion if the person threatened is the person or their kin. The kidnapper would, at worst, get five years in prison if caught. Rumor is that this law changed in 1964 in response to this movie.

Toshiro Mifune is perfect for the role of Kingo Gondo. No one plays calloused, with a hint of humanity, like him.

Every time Takashi Shimura shows up in a movie, I get teary-eyed. I love him so much.

The movie, though in monochrome, has moments of color pop — I won't say more and spoil it, but it's such a striking choice.

If I had one complaint, it would be the ending — it wraps up but it is unsatisfying.

Hans, a convicted criminal, escapes from prison, only to fall on the doorstep of Dr. Zimmer and his daughter, Irma. They bring Hans into the laboratory to perform a procedure that turns him into a human puppet who follows their every command.

When Zimmer attempts to show his findings to the medical community, they call for Zimmer's excommunication. The shock kills him. In his dying words, he begs Irma to continue his work.

So, Irma cooks a rather elaborate plan where she picks up a hitchhiker who looks like her, hits her with a car, sets the car on fire (burning herself in the process), and pushes it in the water to make it look like an accident. She and Hans turn Zimmer's assistant, Barbara, into a puppet and hide in an abandoned mansion.

Irma's plan? To turn a cabaret dancer called Miss Death and make her seduce and murder Vicas' enemies. Irma can control her actions, but can she control her words?

With someone like Jess Franco, who has nearly 200 movies, finding which of his films are legitimately good, which are campy good, and which are cheap trash. This movie is legitimately good. The plot is convoluted, with several things happening before we understand how it all fits together.

The score is jazzy and a lot of fun. We get sultry moments, explosive ones, and at the darkest, it descends into caustic piano.

For a Jess Franco movie, it isn't too gory or horny. I understand that Franco had a hell of a time with the censors on this one. Though he considers it one of his favorites from this era, he regrets making it for all the hassle it caused him.

Miss Death's cabaret show is more bizarre than seductive. She dances with a mannequin that may or may not be alive. We see its eyes darting around, but it remains stiff throughout.

It's 3 AM. U.S. Air Force jets line the tarmac of Interceptor Command Experimental Station 6 in Winthrop, Manitoba. A guard stops for a cigarette and watches the long arc of a jet's condensation trail in the sky. He stops and picks up his gun when he hears the crunch of foliage under shoes from someone's approach. He hears a scream, a thumping, and an odd slurping sound — following it, he finds a dead civilian, arched over in agony.

Major Jeff Cummings, functioning on little sleep and handfuls of Benzedrine at a time, investigates the death. Captain Al Chester suggests he leave the investigation to the local authorities. Cummings worries the locals will blame the death on their nuclear experiments.

Cummings leads an experiment where they use nuclear power to amplify radar so they can reach their aircraft from longer distances. When they fall just out of range, Cummings pushes for an increase in power, cutting close to dangerous levels. Still, the range does not increase. It's almost like something is siphoning off the energy.

At a cow farm near the edge of the air base, Ben Adams hears his wife, Amelia, screaming in the barn. She grasps at her neck and collapses to the ground. Ben finds her dead. He hears a thumping and swishing under the hay. With a pitchfork, he stabs at the hay where he sees movement. Then, something comes behind him and kills him, too.

The Air Force gets to the bodies before the townspeople and performs an autopsy. They find on each a set of puncture holes on the neck, where the spinal cord meets the brain. They cut open the skulls to discover the brains missing — sucked out through the two holes. Not only that, the entire spinal cord is missing. Major Cummings jokes about a mental vampire. The coroner suggests that's the best explanation he's heard thus far.

The Colonel dispatches his team and asks Cummings to interview the townspeople and look for anything suspicious. Will Cummings get an answer before more people die? Is it the USAF's fault that these people are dying, or is something else at play? His first clue is Professor R. E. Walgate's manuscript on thought control.

Crabtree's direction gives the film a human quality — the characters feel like people with lives, senses of humor, and curiosity.

The added melodrama keeps the story at work while the mystery brews beneath the surface. It's not Howard Hawks-level dialogue or anything, but better than most 50s Sci-Fi.

Parker's Barbara has a satisfying cool rationality — someone who isn't quick to scare or jump to conclusions. Cummings has emotional outbursts, especially when accused of ""tomcatting around.""

The film uses stop-motion for the special effects, a satisfying flavor to the film. This wasn't a big-budget movie, so it's surprising to see it used.

We don't see the ""fiends"" until the climax — a bold approach that is confident in the power of its creature. The film relies on sound effects and pantomime to sell the invisible creatures, made visible through radiation. When we do, it's a gore fest as the team shoots and chops up these brain creatures.

As someone who's watched nearly every <i>MST3K</i> episode, and therefore a hefty pile of 50s sci-fi and brainsploitation, this film stands out. I finished this movie with a big dopey smile.

Bardot is a tremendous force, but that isn't enough to sustain the movie. No one else is likable — they all have ulterior motives and selfish whims. Only Juliette is pure of heart, never wishing to lead anyone astray or do them wrong. She does, but only because of unbearable temptation.

Robert is in dire straits because of a poor investment, so he does not notice what occurs in the house. For example, once Slade moves in, he turns all the framed photos to face the wall. Ellen offers to take the portraits down but hopes he doesn’t mind actresses. Ellen’s niece, Kitty, also lives in the house. She is a successful musical performer. When Kitty meets Slade, she finds herself drawn to his brooding demeanor.

Meanwhile, Scotland Yard dispatches Detective John Warwick to hunt down the Ripper. While he doesn’t understand the Ripper’s motive, he sees one clear pattern — all the women he murders are former actresses.

The film incorporates the lighting strategies of film noir to give it a more romantic and striking atmosphere.

It doesn’t rely on the shock of seeing a murder but uses clever symbolic imagery to hint at the carnage — a smashed wine bottle spilling onto the cobblestones, or the rush of muddied water in the drainage channel.

Laird Cregar’s Slade is such a specific weirdo — no human alive today would trust a man who goes out at night and washes his hands in the Thames. Cregar brings pathos that sets a new standard for how to portray a serial killer.

The film touches on the treatment of aging actresses. The up-and-comer sees only their success. In the recesses are those who have grown older and faded from the limelight. Annie, an actress with whom Kitty worked, comes by the theater to see her old dressing room. These are the women that Slade finds and murders.

What Slade and these women share is an unbreakable loneliness. For the actresses, it’s the now empty room, once full of life. For Slade, it’s the dead brother he loved, and obsessed over. Slade would murder these reminders of what led to his brother’s demise.

Ellen catches on pretty early to Slade’s behavior and sees several connections between him and the Ripper. But Robert is such a gaslighting ass that he makes her doubt things she’s seen. There’s a point where it’s hilarious, especially when he talks to Kitty.

<blockquote><i>— Yours is a beauty that could destroy men.
— Oh, is that a compliment?
— Or it could destroy you. Have you thought of that?
— That’s a very queer thing to say.</i></blockquote>

The climax is incredible! The build of tension, Slade creeping in shadows towards the camera, the push and pull of the score — I had chills running up my arms at points.

This film isn’t my favorite featuring Jack the Ripper — that honor still belongs to the incredible <i>Pandora’s Box</i> — but it’s magnificent. Hitchcock’s adaptation of the novel in 1927 is the definitive adaptation. Though I enjoyed that film, I prefer this one.","hooptober, hooptober2.0, written by women, film noir",2024-07-18

<blockquote><i>God chose the foolish things of this world to humiliate the learned, the weak to humiliate the strong.</i> — St. Paul’s Letter to the Corinthians I</blockquote>
<blockquote><i>So Francis, to vanquish the world, made himself contemptible and humble. He became a child in order to be worthy of the kingdom of heaven. The world laughed at him and called him mad, but Pope Innocent had faith in him and gave him permission to bring among men his faith in meekness and poverty. </i></blockquote>
St. Francis and his monks bear a downpour of rain as they make their way to Rivotorto. They stop and debate how the creatures of the earth may gain peace. They come to their hut and find it occupied. The man inside accuses the monks of being thieves and forces them out. This anger and revulsion, and how God has thrown them aside to comfort another, is the sign they need to follow St. Francis.

We follow St. Francis and his monks through nine chapters of his life in which we see his philosophy play out in incidental moments.

Rossellini, who had achieved admiration for his neorealist films, excited some audiences and confounded others with his Catholic ode to St. Francis. After WWII and a crisis of faith, Rosselini found something naïve but admirable in the teachings of St. Francis. He believed it was what would save Europe.

The film isn’t a biography — we learn almost nothing about St. Francis. It isn’t a story — nothing much happens in each episode. In an effort against capital-H History, we receive small, incomplete moments. They suggest an allegory, but move on before we can summarize them. The blocking and framing aim toward a one-dimensionality, like pre-Renaissance paintings.

And so what do we have? We have sketches of the banal: a realism more real than the political or historical can convey.

In my youth, when I was a devout Christian, St. Francis occupied a significant place in my life, even if I didn’t know it. His self-effacing humility, and his emulation of Paul’s decree to be all things to all people, sustained a deep self-hatred within me. I was born nothing. I am nothing. Let God be everything I am not. The resulting emotional suffering did more damage than faith could salvage.

<i>The Seventh Seal</i> drew everything beautiful from this movie and gave it spiritual and psychological significance. <i>Andrei Rublev</i> converted the flat imagery into otherworldly poetry. I'm curious to see how this film informed <i>The Gospel According to St. Matthew</i> when I get around to it.

Aesthetically, this movie is beautiful in its simplicity. Though I disagree with its core messages, I don’t think that belief is necessary to appreciate the film. But it’s a hard film for me to love.","criterion channel, criterion, criterion challenge 2022, cc2022, scorsese's 85 film, edited by women",2024-07-18
2024-07-19,Oddity,2024,https://boxd.it/6Umfgz,3,,"Ted and Dani have purchased a country home. Ted, a doctor at a mental institution, works at night while Dani stays in the unfurnished house doing renovations and sleeping in a tent.

One night, while alone, Dani goes out to her car to fetch something. She hears rustling but thinks nothing of it. Dani returns to the house, only to be startled by a rapping at the door. She pulls back the porthole to see a man with a glass eye. It's Olin Boole, a patient from Ted's hospital. He tells Dani that he saw someone enter the house and that she needs to open the door and leave.

One year later, Ted visits Dani's twin sister, Darcy, at her curio shop, passed down from her mother. Darcy deals primarily with cursed items and claims to be able to tell things about their owner when touching them. Ted invites Darcy to come by the house and visit him and his girlfriend, Yana. It's a few days from the one-year anniversary of when Olin murdered Dani.

With no reply, Ted assumes nothing will come of it. But when the anniversary day comes, Ted and Yana receive a large, locked crate. Then, as Ted leaves for work, Darcy shows up on their doorstep. Ted tries to hint that he can drop her off at home, and they can plan a time to get together. But Darcy wishes to stay and pay wishes. Yana has planned to leave for the city. But she can't find her keys.

What is Darcy up to? What's in the box? What happened the night Dani died?

The way the film reveals information is unusual, and sometimes in passing. Or, we will revisit scenes from different angles to learn something new. At some points, it creates stellar tension. At others, it's just frustrating.

But that strangeness is part of the charm. The director's prior film, <i>Caveat</i>, was not one I liked, but it was out there. I hoped to see what he might do with a bigger budget. 

This film is also tight in scope, focusing on three locations — the country house, the mental hospital, and the curio shop. The country house is where all the tension and questions live, so we spend most of our time there.

What I'm wrestling with is what I found unsatisfying about the movie. It twists and unveils, and I don't have any questions that disrupt them. But I felt deflated learning some of them. I don't know what I wanted. But it wasn't what I got.

Still, this is a leap forward for the director, and I'm so glad I watched it in the theater. I was by myself, and there were some satisfying scares. I enjoyed this, but something is missing for me that I can't quite pinpoint.",amc southpoint,2024-07-18

Bats fill the night sky above Kleinschloss. Kringen carries a walking stick and a lamp, looking like Robert Pattinson in <i>The Lighthouse</i>. A howling wolf draws Kringen’s attention to the bat-laden trees. Then, a man leaps across the ledges along a tower just above the trees. We fly up onto the roof to see the window where the man entered. The lights cut. A woman screams.

Bürgermeister Gustave Schoen discusses the six deaths in Kleinschloss with his council and police inspector Karl Brettschneider. The bürgermeister suspects vampires, as each death involves blood loss and victims have two jugular wounds. Brettschneider is, of course, skeptical, bordering on derisive.

Brettschneider returns home to his lover, Ruth Bertin, who works in her laboratory. Her colleague, Dr. Otto von Niemann, has left to care for Martha, a bat attack victim. Like any good doctor, he takes a swig of her prescribed medication to ensure its efficacy. Consummate weirdo Hermann Gleib visits Martha with flowers. He declares his love of bats, which he collects off the street and cares for like cats.

Gleib follows Dr. von Neimann out. They run into Kringen, who tells the doctor about his encounter with a vampire as a bat. The doctor encourages Kringen to give his testimony to the bürgermeister, but Gleib begs him not to. When Gleib wanders off, Kringen and Dr. von Neimann wonder if Gleib is behind the attacks. The rumors stir the village’s fears.

This film came out around the same time as <i>Doctor X</i>, another Lionel Atwill/Fay Wray movie, and one I adore. That film had Warner Bros. money. This movie had Majestic Pictures money — that is, no money.

Like Roger Corman, the studio used its meager funds to lease existing sets and contract a couple of big names. They made dozens of Pre-Code movies before Republic Pictures bought them up to dominate the quickie market.

Melvyn Douglas is the genuine star of this movie. He’s so charming and funny. Fay Wray is always magnetic, but forever the damsel. At least she gets to be a scientist here.

Dwight Frye shows up as Hermann Gleib. Frye, best known for his role as Renfield in the original Dracula, brings some much-needed weirdness to the equation.

Maude Eburne is pretty funny as the hypochondriac aunt. She uses the doctor’s stethoscope to hear her heartbeat and worries something must be wrong because she can hear it beating. She self-diagnoses that she needs a dose of salicylic acid. Girl, what?

The audio is pretty shoddy. Almost no Foley or sound effects are present. You can hear where they cut the actor’s mic in and out between lines. There’s one scene where it sounds like an audience laughs when Melvyn Douglas jests about blood-sucking vampires, but once he finishes his line, the audio cuts. I'm unsure if it's just the copy I found or the film itself.

The version I watched also had colored, so the torches are a rich red and orange in the otherwise monochrome movie.

The film is quick, running just over an hour. This era of horror is so cozy for me. They’d have to mess up pretty badly for me to hate this. ","midnight pulp, hooptober, hooptober2.0",2024-07-19

<blockquote><i>When I was young, I thought house painters painted houses. What did I know?</i></blockquote>The camera dollies down the hallway of a nursing home. Unlike every nursing home I've been to, these older folks have guests visiting them and smiles on their faces. The mirroring of the club introduction scene from <i>Goodfellas</i> is depressing. We finally make it to Frank Sheeran in a wheelchair, his distant eyes holding a history we'll spend ages learning about.

In the 50s, Frank was a Teamster driving trucks in Philly. Then, he became a house painter. What's a house painter? It's someone who kills folks for the mob, painting the house red with a bullet in the back of the head.

We move through Frank's history, how he became a house painter for Russell Bufalino, and eventually, worked for Jimmy Hoffa.

The de-aging looks like shit. For one, they're all old men. They walk and talk like old men. Just because you paint some wrinkles off their faces or whatever doesn't change their cadence. As I've said in other reviews, I watch plenty of movies with terrible effects, so I don't care that much about it.

The book on which the movie is based is also full of spurious stories that Charles Brandt took at face value. Like Catch Me If You Can (another crock of shit), the history isn't important if the story is entertaining.

But this movie isn't interested in entertainment. It's a meditation on aging, regret, and becoming obsolete. Ang Lee hinted at his fear of death with the hollow <i>Gemini Man</i> and its aging effects. Scorsese's motivations don't seem dissimilar.

It doesn't help that I'm over mob stories. I get it — the mob is the American Dream personified, with all the ugliness it takes to be anything in the US. Here, we step deeper into the co-mingling of political corruption and mob success. Like the politician, the mobster has no authentic self — they create an image that reflects what we want to see and murder everything that contradicts it. We stick with the gangsters way after their heyday to feel all the regret and loss that comes with it.

The script has some jokes in it. They're the same jokes you hear in every mob movie, but they're pretty good.

The last 30 minutes is the movie. And I understand you need it all beforehand to get there. But do we need all three hours of it?

From a filmmaking perspective, the whole thing seems like a tremendous ordeal to piece together. The cast is huge and the locations are all over the place.

I didn't hate this. It's just not going to stick with me. Thankfully, <i>Killers of the Flower Moon</i> came out after this and has stuck with me. Scorsese's still got it, when he isn't making gangster flicks.

<b>San Francisco, Twenty-Seven Years Later</b>
Barbary Nell and Frisco Pete hang around the Barbary Coast, a red-light district of San Francisco. Nell drinks up a fellow until he passes out, then lifts cash from his billfold. Pete, upon catching her, stabs her and kills her. Blizzard, the Barbary Coast underworld leader, sees Pete running away and offers to hide him away. Blizzard is the child that Dr. Ferris mutilated, all grown up.

Lichtenstein, from the Federal Secret Service, meets with his best operative, Rose. He offers her a job to infiltrate Blizzard’s underworld and bring his entire operation down. Specifically, Lichtenstein wants to stop Blizzard from empowering the socialist movements and unions.

Rose’s role will be to gain entrance to the underground hat factory Blizzard runs with the labor of the city’s dance hall girls. Lichtenstein believes it is a front for an anarchic movement Blizzard will lead.

Meanwhile, Blizzard concocts a more personal plan that will allow him to walk again. How? It begins when Blizzard poses for a bust of Satan. The artist? Dr. Ferris’ daughter, Barbara.

<blockquote><i>In time the man would mangle the soul of the daughter, even as the father had mangled the body of the man.</i></blockquote>

The film was an early breakthrough role for Lon Chaney, who played Blizzard. To play the role, he wore a dangerous apparatus that held his legs completely back. The result is effective — you can tell what he’s doing, but his acting sells it. His performance makes the movie great but is not the only selling point.

The film also cashed in on the first Red Scare that evolved from post-WWI nationalism. US Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer easily conflated organized labor movements, strikes, and Galleanist anarchist bombings to empower illegal search and seizures, arrests, and deportations.

Throwing Blizzard in with this phantom organized villain conveyed the extent of his power to audiences of the time.

Still, the film effectively builds two through lines — the Red uprising and Blizzard’s leg plot. We get the secrets of his shop and the moments of his past that led him to his life of crime. The sets are rich with details — hidden passages and accommodations to Blizzard’s physical condition fill out the world in their fleeting moments.

The movie surprised me with scenes of nudity. Barbara Ferris is a sculptor and has a model pose nude for one of her statues. It’s not racy or indulgent, but it caught me off guard.

The film was the first collaboration between Lon Chaney and director Wallace Worsley. Because of the success of this, they worked on a few more movies together, most famously with 1923’s adaptation of <i>The Hunchback of Notre Dame</i>.

A rock band performs at a Manhattan bar. The crowd goes buts for it, crawling over each other in riotous dancing. Bennie, a light-skinned black man, leaves the gig to meet up with his white friends, Dennis and Tom. They hit up a jazz bar to pick up women. Bennie's a little awkward but handsome, talking to Nancy about his jazz musician career as a trumpeter. The other guys are more forward about their intentions to varying degrees of success.

Bennie finds his brother, Hugh, who is more dark-skinned, at the club where he plays. He begs Hugh for $20 to pay off a guy. Rupe, Hugh's manager, talks Hugh into a gig where he has to introduce a girly line — embarrassing, but good pay. Hugh's crooner style isn't in vogue, so jobs are tough.

Bennie and Hugh's younger sister, Leila, who is more light-skinned than her brother, sends Hugh off to the train station. Hugh begs her not to walk home alone at night in the city, but nothing's happened before. What's going to happen now? A guy stalks her for a bit, but Bennie's around and pushes the guy away.

Leila's a writer dating an older white guy named David. They go to a literary party, and David can't help himself critiquing Leila's writing. At the party, she meets Tony, who changes everything for Leila.

The film follows these three as they navigate a city where blackness is relative to the situation. Being white-passing grants some opportunities but also some misunderstandings that can unveil racial prejudices they didn't know were there.

<blockquote><i>You never break your pattern, you'll never go anywhere in life.</i></blockquote>As Cassavetes' first film, its road from conception to the final product is complicated. It started as an improvisation exercise and went through endless practices to arrive at a concrete script. They reworked the film after the first version didn't land how he wanted it to.

Charles Mingus did three hours of music for the movie. Cassavetes removed most of it from the final version of the movie. According to him, it didn't follow the tone of the film.

The film's presentation of race, while simple by today's standards, was shocking for its predominantly white audience. Most were not aware of white-passing black folks, let alone that race could be so functionally fluid.

The film also looks at NY intelligentsia — the bubble of self-righteousness that pops when women are anything other than what men project onto them. You're a dancer, that's great! Oh, an exotic dancer? That's pretty regressive, but I'll still fuck you. Classic liberal posturing.

Lelia Goldini's performance is heartbreaking and honest. She's desperate to arrive where she wants to be. At 20, it feels like too much life has passed and that you must figure it all out immediately. That rush pushes you to be adventurous and open, but the cost can be immeasurable pain.

Ben doesn't grasp the racial complexities the way Hugh does. His performance is a little more broad and unfocused. Hugh Hurd's performance is tremendous — he holds a world of awful understanding in his eyes.

The film is rough around the edges. These frays are both a first-film issue and a part of the unresolved tensions. It's hard to state how important this movie was to the independent film world in the US. It's a conversation piece in the truest sense. The film is incomplete without the audience talking about it afterward.

Elizabeth and Enrico lay in a rowboat together,  making out. Enrico tries to push her to go further, but she doesn't want to fuck in a boat. She briefly opens her eyes to see a man chasing a woman through the woods. Enrico treats her like an asshole for ignoring his advances. Elizabeth tries to focus, but the glint of a knife hits her eyes. She opens them to see the man shoving a knife between the woman's legs. Enrico forces her to stay quiet about what she saw. As her professor at the St. Mary's Catholic School for Girls, he could get into hot water for hooking up with her. If she brings the murder to authorities, their questions may reveal what they were doing.

Cue the Morricone score.

Enrico drips Elizabeth off at her bike and follows her home in his car. At home, Enrico hears the murder discussed on the radio. Herta, his wife and coworker, shuts it off. He jumps in his car and races to the crime scene. Then, he makes it to the school. At the school, Inspector Barth from Scotland Yard has assembled the school's teaching staff. Enrico is the last to arrive and an hour late.

Barth shows each professor photos from the crime scene. We meet our suspects one by one. Enrico recognizes the victim — Hilda Erikson. He brings the news to his gym class. Brenda guesses that someone murdered Hilda.

Police photos show Enrico at the crime scene, building suspicion around him. How will he clear his name? Who murdered Hilda? Who is Solange?

The film confidently lets the circumstances unfold, giving the audience enough information to keep the tension tight. That alone helps this stand out from many of its fellow Giallo flicks.

The film also hints at the repressive nature of Catholicism and how that fuels the violent sublimations in the murder more than any lurid film could motivate.

Genre fans may find the film a bit too tame or straightforward. The pacing is also a little lax. But I appreciate a film that manages a twist without contorting the plot into nonsense.

<b>May 8, 1945</b>
The birds sing outside a small country church. Maciek lay resting g next to Andrzej. They discuss the details again — Szczuka, Secretary of the District Workers' Party. A small girl asks Andrzej to open the church for her. He shows her that it's locked and tells her to scram.

Drewnowski, on the lookout, gives a whistle to signal the target arriving. Maciek and Andrzej grab their automatic weapons and get in position. The car crests the horizon, and they shoot, causing it to crash. One slips out and runs for the church. Maciek riddles him with hot bullets that catch fire on the man's coat.

Drewnowski takes their guns and runs. Maciek and Andrzej saunter off. Another vehicle comes soon after to find the bodies. It's Szczuka, and the dead men were factory workers. Szczuka reminds the onlookers that more of this is to come — the war's end is not the end of their fight for Poland.

In the city, an announcement informs everyone that Germany has signed an unconditional act of surrender. Drewnowski, who works for the mayor, goes to the Hotel Monopol Restaurant, where a banquet will be held for the war victory. He goes over the details to ensure the mayor will be pleased. Maciek sees a cute girl working the bar at the restaurant and orders a drink. Andrzej slips away to call their superior to inform him they completed the job. But Maciek, waiting in the lobby, overhears Szczuka and his aide enter.

The film follows Maciek as his team plots how to take out Szczuka. Meanwhile, through his many encounters that night, he wonders if he's doing the right thing — for the country, but more importantly, for himself.
<blockquote><i>So often, you are a burning torch with flakes of burning hemp falling about you. Flaming, you know not whether flames bring freedom or death, consuming all you cherish. Will only ashes remain and chaos whirling in the void? Or will the ashes hold the glory of a starlike diamond, the Morning Star of everlasting triumph?</i></blockquote>Throughout the movie, propaganda inundates the characters. After the victory announcement, they show films of Polish armies stopping tanks and taking prisoners. At the banquet, the musical performance is a woman singing about finding and killing the rat enemy. The war is over, but they must rebuild. And they must decide under whose idealism.

The film tones down the propagandistic tone of the novel on which it's based, adding more shades of nuance to the resistance members compared to the novel's caricature of bandits. This ambiguity stirred the ire of several Polish audiences. But this film would not be nearly as successful without the sympathetic treatment it gives all the characters.

This treatment falls in with director Andrzej Wajda's philosophy and that of the Polish Film School, which followed Italian Neorealism but opposed Socialist Realism's push for portraying the collective and focusing on the individuals at play.

Fire is a recurring motif — the fire on the coat from the bullets, the shots lit aflame in memory of fallen comrades, and the cigarettes that Maciek lights for Szczuka. Fire is all that remains of those consumed by the war. Passion and zeal carry victories and shorten lives. It works out, or it doesn't.

Zbigniew Cybulski's Maciek is a bit of an anachronism, reading more James Dean than WWII resistance operant. But that image of rebellion is what made him so iconic. And it fits the narrative as Maciek questions the idealism of the war he fights. The rhetoric he has consumed has led him to believe in heroism in his acts. Wajda interrogates the idea of the hero contrasted with the person allowed to exist in the world.
<blockquote><i>— I can't go on killing and hiding. I just want to live. You've got to understand!
</i><i>— You keep forgetting you're one of us. And that counts.</i></blockquote>The film has heavy themes but presents them with a breezy effortlessness. It has so many iconic moments and scenes. I've never seen a wartime film handle its subjects this way. It's disorienting but in a good way.

If I were Maciek, I would simply defect for Ewa Krzyżewska.","criterion channel, criterion, cc2022, criterion challenge 2022, pol, solidarity, 1001 movies",2024-07-21

<blockquote><i>30,000 people are reported missing in Australia every year. 90% are found within a month. Some are never seen again.</i></blockquote>

<b>Broome, Western Australia, 1999</b>
Ben is a native Aussie who is buying a car for a trip to Cairns, Queensland. His friends Liz and Kristy are British tourists who have backpacked across Australia for the past two weeks. They'll be in the car for three weeks — the first stop is Wolf Creek National Park.

The group parties that night before heading off the following day. Things are already a little tense between them — Liz thinks Ben has a crush on Kristy. Kristy wakes up the next morning in bed next to Ben. They hit the road hungover. They stop at a caravan park in Halls Creek and set up camp, where they tell each other scary stories about alien experiences where watches and cars stop working.

The next day, they make it to Wolf Creek, where they hike up a ridge to the top of a massive crater. Ben and Kristy have a smooch and wonder about why the meteor hit where it hit before heading back to the car. They all realize that their watches have stopped. Kristy tries to start the car, but the engine won't turn over. So, they spend the night in the car and will make a plan in the morning.

In the night, lights approach. Ben thinks it's a UFO and that they shouldn't signal it down. But it's just a truck, and a guy named Mick. Mick offers to help, but they must come back to his place to work on the car.

I'm already approaching the halfway point of the movie. You know where it's going.

The film focuses on establishing the beauty of Australia for the first bit — picturesque skies, expansive landscapes, and weird-ass emus. Then, as the weather turns, the world grows smaller, and the beauty feels miles away.

Basing a film on true events can be fun when it's a ghost story because it asks you to expand your concept of what is possible. When it's based on real-life murders, it feels pretty fucked up.

I can't remember why I watched <i>Wolf Creek 2</i> — maybe it was on some list. All I remember is that, when Mick started dressing a couple like a deer and chopping off their genitals, I disassociated through the rest of it. Nothing in this movie comes close to that.

The film does what it says on the box, but not an ounce more. It's not the violence, but the lazy plotting and half-cocked characterization that doesn't cohere because they put all the budget into the violence.


<b>*** SPOILER TALK ***</b>
Mick tortures and murders tourists, or anyone who's too posh (Ben, being from Sydney, counts). The back half of the movie is us watching him graphically torture and dismember these folks. We get sort of final girl with Liz, who has some awareness. But the film doesn't want us to have any hope, so she dies.

It doesn't help that Liz and Kristy make completely nonsensical choices. They escape! They made it! But they push the truck over the ledge?? I don't understand.

A woman comes into a clothing store to buy some men's clothes. She isn't too specific beyond colors, not really knowing sizes. She takes the clothes to try on. The owners chuckle with each other and go to a back compartment. There, they have a monitor set up, observing a video feed from the changing room. The feed runs through a VHS deck, allowing them to record the feed as she removes her shirt. One owner hands the other a baseball glove. He puts on the glove, grabs a baseball bat, and chats her up before hitting her in the head with the bat. He kisses the bloody, unconscious woman before taking the end of the bat to her face.

Cue the sick synth soundtrack.

Steve and Rachel Emory run a video rental place in Frenchtown, New Jersey. The couple moved there from New York a few weeks ago and opened the first VHS rental shop within 15 miles. Though no one has cable or satellite dishes — the town actually forbade them — everyone in town owned a VHS cassette player long before the Emory's arrived. In a matter of weeks, the shop gained over 300 new members.

Rick, an employee, is putting away tapes from the drop-off bin when he finds a blank cassette. Steve assumes it's a mistake and sets it aside. Rick begs to watch it, but Steve isn't interested in whatever these locals consider ""entertainment."" He has an idea, though — he only rents out horror and pornography. A customer comes in to rent Pieces, but is reticent to say anything more beyond their club membership number.

Steve relents to Rick, and they put on the blank tape. In it, Rick recognizes the former postmaster who supposedly retired. Here, a man smashes the postmaster's face in with a hammer and cuts off his limbs. Steve and Rick watch in horror as the men cycle through their toys, laughing as blood shoots everywhere. Steve closes the store and goes to the police. He begs the police chief to come with him, who thinks Steve is full of shit. When they get back to the store, though, Rick is missing. Someone has replaced the tape with home movies.

The film follows Steve over the next couple of days as he tries to figure out what the hell is going on.

Gary Cohen filmed the movie on a VHS recorder and edited it at a local access station in New Jersey. He shopped around, eventually selling distribution rights to Camp Video because they offered to design box art. Cohen claims the entire project cost him $6.

That said, the movie makes an honest effort at being legit. Characters have backstories and motivations, the plot is coherent. The first act, though cheap, is legitimately intriguing.

The special effects are pretty good! Someone's been reading their copy of Tom Savini's <i>Grande Illusions</i>.

The procedural elements are clunky, only because it methodically works through its own logic like its Sherlock Holmes going over the evidence. But it's a pretty absurd concept that the audience picks up on pretty quickly, so you actually want Steve to make some logic leaps and get it already.

This tape was one of the most widely distributed SOV horror films, following in the footsteps of <i>Boardinghouse</i>, <i>Sledgehammer</i>, and the popular <i>Blood Cult</i>. The movie makes an homage to <i>Blood Cult</i>, featuring it prominently on the shelves and having a hilarious encounter in which a customer asks if it had sexual content. Steve tells her no, but that it's brutally violent. Still, she considers it okay for kids so long as there isn't sex in it. This exchange came from an actual conversation Cohen had while working at a video store. And I believe it too! My family was like that, and actually mocked my aunt when she told everyone she had the opposite stance.

There's a guy in one of the homemade videos playing a vampire. He looks like Freddy Mercury or Adam Ant. I had to look it up to make sure it wasn't.

This film has the bones of a brilliant film, but lacks the budget and acting power to carry it. If you can handle SOV budget, this one is popular for a reason — it's one of the best SOV horror movies I've seen thus far.","tubi, hooptober, hooptober2.0, slasher, sov",2024-07-23

The first seconds of the movie immediately tell you that you are watching a Shinya Tsukamoto movie. Ten dudes stand equidistant in a boxing ring, performing choreographed punching and dodging. The camera shakes violently as it passes across each man. A fist punches the screen, creating a gory hole where the fist has presumably opened your skull.

Tsuda goes door-to-door selling his firm’s consulting service. While passing an office, he sees a room full of boxing men. The stairwell is full of bruised men recovering and resting. As he passes one man, the man chases after Tsuda. It’s Kojima, a friend from high school.

Back home, Tsuda collapses on his fiancée Hizuru’s lap. Hizuru stopped working when they got engaged. The stress of supporting them both is killing Tsuda. When Tsuda returns home, he finds Kojima and Hizuru chatting. He doesn’t know how Kojima found him.

While Tsuda continues to flop sweat through life, Kojima comes by the apartment when Tsuda isn’t around to visit with Hizuru. He tries to come on to Hizuru, but she tells him to fuck off. Still, when Tsuda finds out, he punches a hole in the wall. He finds where Kojima lives and tries to fight him, but Kojima moves faster than Tsuda can comprehend. His punches send blood flying everywhere like an anime.

This scene changes Hizuru. She breaks things off with Tsuda over dinner when he cannot stop asking about what’s happening between her and Kojima. She moves in with Kojima and gives herself intense piercings and tattoos, craving the pain it causes her.

To win Hizuru back, Tsuda takes up boxing. In doing so, he continues a chain that Tsuda and Kojima started years ago.

<blockquote><i>— What’s Kojima to you?
— I wouldn’t mind if he beats me to death.</i></blockquote>The film has a fractal quality, where scenes are brief and time passes between each rapidly. It feels less like a linear story than circling a drain. The movie pulses between moments of quiet contemplation and eruptions of intensity and violence.

On paper, the film could look like an un-ironic <i>Fight Club</i>. But this isn’t about the seductive nature of self-destruction. It’s about the violence required to find your identity in a world that does everything possible to reduce you to nothing. Especially in Japan, conformity is expected and praised. Hizuru getting a tattoo might be the most transgressive act in the film. Tsuda wants to help her cover it up, but that’s the wrong lesson. Accepting her evolution is crucial for him to win her back.

Kaori Fujii as Hizuru is by far the best part of this movie. Her performance conveys the intensity of body transformation more than the boys’ boxing.

The middle part of the movie lags in places. But the film is so short, and the structure is so chaotic that it doesn’t hinder it much. It’s worth it to get to the climactic fight.

The content I would warn anyone about is Tsuda passing a decomposing cat, where maggots are eating through its chest and face.

In classic Giallo fashion, a horse-drawn carriage ambles through Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, USA. It crosses over a roadway where cars wait to cross. In one car is Bob Crane, a forest ranger. He arrives at Hamilton's Store, a kitschy souvenir shop, where Mrs. Gordon brings him a long-awaited package. Inside is Moda Italia, a fashion magazine. On the cover is Bob's twin sister, Jessica — her first cover. It also has a handwritten note from Jessica giving her new address and phone number in Milan, Italy.

Throughout all this, we get glimpses of Jessica's life in Milan — a lingerie photoshoot followed by a night at the discotheque. Some man follows her into the bathroom. He pours some coke onto the side of his hand and forces it into her face. When she resists, he pins her against the wall and pulls down her dress to bite her nipples. She scratches the man's neck.

While this happens, Bob receives a call over the radio atop a lookout tower. Warren wants him to check on some campers on his way home. Bob is descending the lookout tower steps. As the man in Milan pins Jessica's hand behind her, Bob feels his hand pulled behind his back. He struggles not to fall over the railing. Jessica writhes loose of the man's grip and Bob regains composure.

Jessica returns to her hotel to take a shower. She takes a pill. Bob checks on the campers. He crosses a bridge and begins feeling woozy. He falls into a trance as he looks over the bridge. He sees the hotel where Jessica is staying. Though he attempts to carry on, his vision shifts between where he is and the eyes of a stranger. The eyes walk down the hotel hall, black-gloved and holding a pair of scissors. They stand in front of Jessica's door.

Bob runs to his truck and calls Warren on the radio. He gives Warren Jessica's number, telling him to call her and to tell her not to open the door. They get through to the hotel front desk, asking him to check on Jessica. The clerk checks the room, but it looks unoccupied.

So, Bob travels to Milan to find her. He goes through the hotel. The scene mirrors his vision but at a different time of day. She still isn't there. So, Bob goes to the local police inspector Danesi to ask for his help in tracking Jessica down. Though Danesi doubts Bob's supposed psychic connection to Jessica, he agrees to help.

The influences may be obvious — <i>Blow-Up</i>'s fashion photography and murders, <i>Sister</i>'s twin telepathy, and <i>Body Double</i>'s POV kills and big drill.

Donald Pleasance plays Inspector Danesi, complete with a mustache and a terrible Italian accent.

FireWatch fans will get a powerful sense of déjà vu watching the Yellowstone portion.

The movie will come to a halt — sometimes mid-sentence — so someone can spot a nude or semi-nude model wandering about. It's so funny.

They play ""One Night in Bangkok,"" from the musical <i>Chess</i>, during a fashion show. The subtitles provide the lyrics and they're so disorienting. 

The film gets a little gay but in a problematic way. I'll leave it there and avoid spoilers.

The film is pretty good. The ending is the best part; it feels like it takes so long to get there. If you need gratuitous nudity or De Palma references, here you go.

In Lyndon B. Johnson’s America, an ice cream truck sits on the curb. A car drives up to the truck and shoots it full of bullets, killing the titular Ice Cream King. The Ice Cream King falls from the car, holding a push-up pop. Young Gregory Tudor strides up to the dead body, takes the push-up pop, and sits down next to the body to enjoy his frozen treat. A spatter of blood adorns his face as his mother runs screaming out of the house to him. When she asks if he’s okay, he replies,
<blockquote><i>Who’s gonna bring the ice cream, mommy?</i></blockquote>Cut to the present day, 1995. Dressed in a jean vest, Roger chases down the ice cream truck. Who is the ice cream man? Why, it’s Gregory Tudor, all grown up. In deference to the fallen Ice Cream King, Gregory goes by Ice Cream Prince. Gregory’s gruff and off-putting, trying to jest with the kids the way the Ice Cream King might. But in William J. Clinton’s America, everything is Poochie — except for ice cream men.

Back home that night, Gregory’s landlord’s dog, Dinky, barks at the ice cream man. He produces a push-up pop. But when he pulls down the sleeve, a blade unveils. Nurse Wharton, Gregory’s orderly and landlord, hears the barking outside subside, replaced with pained whimpering. She goes to check on the dog and finds Gregory in the window with blood on his face. He claims it's grenadine, and she cheerfully accepts it. He puts the dog in a wood chipper.

At a kid named Johnny’s house, his mother receives a phone call that little Roger Smith is missing. The following day, the police stop Gregory’s ice cream truck to ask about the missing kid. The detective also orders two scoops of rocky road. Inside Gregory’s freezer, we see buckets of bloody mystery meat covered in cute little white mice. Gregory pulls a retina from an eyeball, to mix into the ice cream. We watch the detective bite into the ice cream and let the retina dance on his tongue.

The kids suspect Gregory may have something to do with Roger’s disappearance. But the kids learn more about the Ice Cream Prince than they bargained for.

The film explores childhood trauma and the myriad ways parents fuck up their kids. Every kid has parents with some issues. Some are as straightforward as a cheating husband. One kid has a mother ostensibly possessed by the archangel Gabriel, who speaks through her in spittle and whelps. Focusing on the kids makes the adult problems feel trivial and silly, while the kids’ concerns are grave and life-or-death. It’s a fun inversion.

We regularly enter Gregory’s dreams of his time in the sanitarium, complete with a John Wayne Gacy clown and Nurse Wharton feeding him ice cream. I guess we’re supposed to get an insight into what fucked him up, but I can’t tell if these are accurate memories or dream logic.

The movie’s humor isn’t to my taste, especially Clint Howard’s raspy intensity. But as it continued, I softened to it and even chuckled aloud a few times. At one point, we visit the sanitarium where Gregory went, and I genuinely can’t tell what tone they’re going for. Aspects of it seem like it is supposed to be humorous, but it’s just sad.

I can’t tell if this movie is supposed to be for kids or if it’s lampooning 80s kid-friendly horror. I think that lack of clarity is why this only found an audience among horror nerds. Like, there’s a joke where, after killing a woman, the ice cream man finds a diaphragm. No kid is going to get that. Hell, today, most people under 40 won’t get it.

The same director as <i>Edward Penishands</i> directed this under an alias. I had to dig to figure out that Paul Norman and Norman Apstein are the same person. Hence, how a “onetime director” made this mid-budget, competently constructed film.

The film is a bit of a mess, but it has enough charm to keep me from hating it. Tubi has a RiffTrax version of this that I might check out in the future, even though I think riffing on movies intended to be comedies is a fool’s errand.

The last 20 minutes totally undermined the direction the rest of the movie was going!

Argive soldiers, led by King Acrisius, carry a wooden box through hazardous terrain to the sea. He calls Zeus to bear witness as Acrisius drowns his daughter Danaë and her infant son Perseus. The soldiers put Danaë and Perseus in the wooden box and cast it into the sea.

A seagull carries the news to Mount Olympus and Zeus. Though Acrisius has shown devotion to the gods in the past, this murder stirs Zeus’ ire. He calls for Acrisius’s death and for Poseidon to pull out all the stops to destroy Argos — namely, to release the Kraken.

Hera doesn’t understand why Zeus shows no mercy. Thetis and Aphrodite give her the big secret. Zeus loves Danaë, and Perseus is Zeus’s son. And so, Danaë and Perseus float to Serifos where he grows to adulthood and learns some sick horse tricks.

Because it’s Greek mythology, we get an onslaught of betrayals, retributions, and transforming dudes into monsters. Perseus is our hero, though, so we watch him use Zeus’s power and Thetis’ jealous rage to take on the Kraken, the Gorgon, and whatnot.

This film has a few things going for it. Foremost, they get Ray Harryhausen to do the special effects in his signature Dynamation. Also, you get my boy Laurence Olivier to play Zeus, and baby, we got a stew going. 

I could list off half the cast with excitement but look at the cast list. Producer Charles H. Schneer wanted the movie to feel like an epic theatrical experience and not a genre flick (which it is), so he sought bigger names for the gods. Many agreed to do it because their scenes took eight days to finish.

The plotting is the weak link here. I don’t care about anyone or why they do anything in this movie. And that’s, like, a huge part of this movie.

The boys are at the pub. Luke grabs some pints for Phil, Hutch, and Dom while Rob drinks wine. The gang discusses their upcoming holiday. Rob suggests The King’s Trail (Kungsleden), a hiking route that runs between Sweden and Norway in the northern part of Sweden. No one’s that into it, so they leave it.

On the way home, Luke wants to keep drinking, but the boys are feeling their 40s. Rob’s up for it and they hit up a liquor store. Luke notices the woman behind the register is on the ground, her face bloodied. Two robbers emerge from the back room. Luke slips behind the shelf and hides. Rob, frozen, stands in place. The robbers shake down Rob and demand Rob’s wedding ring. When he doesn’t give it up, one robber slashes Rob’s face and beats him to the ground. While Rob bleeds out, the men rifle through his pockets to find nothing else and leave.

Luke wakes up in his sleeping bag and tent. Six months have passed since Rob’s death. Luke, Phil, Hutch, and Dom are hiking the Kungsleden in Rob’s memory. The boys march to the top of a steep hill. There, the boys build a shrine with rocks, candles, and a photo of Rob. Luke blames himself for Rob’s death, even though the others have assured him otherwise. That night, Luke and Hutch see lights in the woods.

The next day, a constant rain falls on the boys as they hike. They soldier on through the golden grass and ash-gray rock. While cursing Sweden to lick his gooch, Dom misses a dip and falls hard into it, injuring his knee. They are still miles away from their destination. No one has cell reception. Hutch suggests they cut through the woods and go to the lights they saw last night. Luke is reluctant to leave the trail, but Dom overhears and insists on the shortcut. As they walk, Hutch checks his compass.

While hiking through the woods, the group spots an elk hanged in the tree branches. Someone (or something) cut open the elk and poured its guts out on the ground several feet below it. It’s also still bleeding, meaning the kill is fresh. The rain worsens as night falls, and the group finds an abandoned cabin. What they find inside will pull back the curtains and make these boys experience F E E L I N G S.

The film also deals with colonialism. These are British boys marching into an unknown territory and acting as if it owes them passage. This troupe is common in folk horror. 

For most of the movie, the boys deal with their fear of the unknown. They each experience nightmares that travel into their fears and pains. What do Brits fear most? I’ll discuss more at the SPOILER ZONE.

The filmmaking is altogether good. It uses a lot of CGI and it mostly works. The third act has some ambitions the filmmakers can’t quite reach — namely, the creature. But it never falters so much that it took me out.

We don’t really have characters. Luke is mostly “the guy who saw Rob die.” Hutch is “the guy with a compass.” Dom is “the guy with the knee injury.” And Phil is… the British Asian guy, I guess.

We also get little in terms of story. We get some answers, but they won’t surprise anyone who has seen, say, <i>The Wicker Man </i>or <i>The Blair Witch Project</i>.

Overall, this movie is decent. I understand why some folks love it. I wanted the film to develop more themes than the obvious and tired one. When it ended, I felt like I experienced little.


<b>*** SPOILER TALK ***</b>
So, the biggest fear of the predominantly atheist England is a god they must bow to. As colonizers, they may bring their god to you, but never the other way around. So, when Luke must bow to the god of the forest, who gives the villagers eternal life, he would rather kill all of them and set their village on fire than bow.

I know, I know, he’s showing he’s changed by facing his fear instead of hiding in cowardice like he did with Rob. But folk horror is often about how men think they can control nature, and how it overwhelms them. This film is about men who think they can control nature, and do.","hooptober, hooptober2.0, folk horror: a study, folk horror",2024-07-26

Yes sir, Cody is the redneck James Bond, complete with fancy gadgets like a readout pager and a tape recorder. He’s also hotter than any Bond I’ve seen.

Contessa Luciana meets with government intelligence operative Douglas F. Wilton to discuss how Russians steal computer technology. Douglas suggests Cody investigate for them. Cody and Contessa go dancing and fuck before she agrees.

So, 20 minutes into the movie, Cody gets into some plot. His mission is to stay at the Chamberlain mansion in Bel Air and see what they’re up to. What sort of hijinks will Cody be getting into while investigating these socialites?

Andy Sedaris has the spirit of Russ Meyer — here, he blends stupid humor, wall-to-wall nude scenes, and as many cool cars as possible. Like Clint Ramsey in Supervixen, Cody can’t escape the eyes of buxom ladies with one thing on their mind.

Where Andy Sedaris has Meyer beat is that Sedaris knows how to shoot all genders with a lustful eye. We get a variety of muscular boys to complement the Playboy models who litter the movie, including henchmen Matthew, Mark, and Luke.
<blockquote><i>— He’s a pretty boy, ain’t he?
— You looking to fuck him?
— Yeah, maybe!</i></blockquote>Henry Strzelecki’s roots-style country plays throughout. It was disorienting in the opening credits, where a woman types on a computer with long, red nails, spelling out the credits for us. But as it goes and we get to know Cody, it fits.

Of course, it’s not without its problems. Despite its bisexual gaze, it has some homophobic slurs and plays a drag queen character for laughs. But she’s also hot and fully committed — even Cody can’t help but admire her. And the only person to use slurs is a villain. So, it’s hard to draw an easy conclusion on the intent.

This movie is shameless, tasteless schlock. It never pretends to be anything else. It’s also undeniably entertaining.

After <a href=""https://boxd.it/6YjG8R"">the adventures of Cody Abilene in Malibu</a>, Cody quit the agency to become an actor. We go to Hawaii, to the Ala Moana Yacht Club in Honolulu. Here, we meet Rowdy Abilene, Cody’s cousin. Rowdy also has a yacht called the Malibu Express. He also shares his cousin’s unshakable sexual appeal. Rowdy holds political (and sexual) congress with Donna, a DEA operative working undercover for Molokai Cargo. He wants her to quit and stay with him on O’ahu. But she has a job to do, and the danger doesn’t phase her.

The Daioo family, who owns Molokai, grows weed on the island. The local marshals have kept tabs on them for generations, but the islanders appreciate the work and economic stimulus the farm provides. But something has changed in the operation, and a drug lord named Seth Romero has taken over.

Donna meets up with Taryn, a civilian pilot in witness protection with whom she flies shipments for Molokai Cargo. There, a forklift worker accidentally pulls a contamination warning off of a crate holding a snake injected with deadly toxins from cancer-infested rats. Incidentally, there is also another live snake meant for display at the Molokai Ranch Wildlife Park. Donna and Taryn’s boss, Dickson, gives them the rundown on their runs for the day: a newlywed couple flying to Halawa Valley, and a snake. Guess which snake they’re supposed to take? And guess which one they get?

Donna and Taryn encounter a toy helicopter. Two of Romero’s henchmen arrive. The helicopter’s doors open, revealing two steel cases. The women reach in to take them, but the henchmen tell them to freeze. Donna unveils a shuriken from her boot. Taryn tosses her baton at one henchman’s face. Donna tosses the shuriken into the other’s chest. In doing so, she accidentally drops one of the steel cases, but keeps hold of the other. They retrieve their respective weapons and escape to the plane. The injured henchmen realize the cases aren’t in the helicopter as it returns to its place of origin. 

Little do Donna and Taryn know they’ve drawn targets on their back. They jump in the jacuzzi to brainstorm. It looks like they’ll need the help of one Rowdy Abilene and his partner, Jade. And they accidentally set the cancer snake loose.

Like <i>Malibu Express</i>, the movie has a creative credit sequence. This time, they print the credits on shipping crates and move them around a warehouse. This movie is also more coherently assembled — a blessing and a curse.

Ronn Moss doesn’t have Darby Hinton’s comedic timing. And while he isn’t my type, he’s still sexy. It’s not important, though. Despite what the poster suggests, Rowdy isn’t the lead here. Donna and Taryn are. So, having a handsome idiot assistant who only knows how to use a bazooka and fuck is appropriate.

Harold Diamond, who I recently saw in <i>Killing American Style</i>, plays Jade. This film makes much better use of his charm and fit body. 

I was a little on the fence about this movie. But then Rowdy produced his bazooka to kill a skateboarding spy, and I lost it. There’s also a scene where Rowdy and Jade receive a note from the agency hidden in a sandwich. After reading the note, they set the note and the sandwich on fire. It’s so funny.

This film loses the country score and opts for 80s synth-pop. Jay Molina’s “Hard Ticket to Hawaii” sets the tone with its breezy yet driving sound. Think Peter Cetera’s solo career.

Taryn has decorated her house with Andy Sedaris movie posters. She has a <i>Stacey</i> poster, buys a <i>Seven</i> poster, and the store throws in a <i>Malibu Express</i> poster for free.

The on-location photography is gorgeous, helping set up the dichotomy between the beautiful landscape and the dark workings hidden within. Also, Lost fans will recognize several shots.

Since Andy Sedaris came up in the sports world as a pioneering sports coverage director, we get a side plot involving a sportscaster named Jimmy John. It’s pretty weak, but I think he interviews actual sports stars?

If I hadn’t seen <i>Malibu Express</i>, this may have rocked my world. It’s altogether a better movie, but some of the prior film’s charm is the lack of coherence. Still, fans of action exploitation films must check this out.","tubi, nature attacks",2024-07-27

It's a starry night over London. As one star falls, several fireworks hit the sky. It's Guy Fawkes Night. Samantha's nursing shift ends, and she walks home. She walks into an alley and passes a congregation of graffiti on the wall: Pest, Dennis, Jerome, Biggz, and Moses. Out of the alleyway and down the walk are five teens in heavy coats, all wearing face coverings. They circle her and mug her at knifepoint. As Moses pushes her down, something massive falls from the sky and trashes a nearby car. A firework? A bomb? Samantha escapes while they're distracted.

Moses surveys the inside for any goods worth stealing. He climbs inside and encounters a white, furry creature. It slashes his face, so he stabs it. The creature runs away, but Moses won't let it live. The gang chases it down and kills it. One thinks it's an orangutan. Another suggests an alien.

While they celebrate, several more meteors descend from the sky. The gang parades their kill around the block before taking it to a local gang leader named Hi-Hatz to see what sort of money they can make off it.  But Hi-Hatz isn't interested in the alien. Instead, he gives Moses some coke to deal if he wants to make money. The meteors hit the surface, and the gang takes them on.

But these creatures aren't like the ones they killed. They're huge and far more violent. Will the gang fight or flee? Can they stop the aliens from taking over their block?

While this is going on, Samantha has called the police. Though they take ages to get to her and take her statement, they're keen to tackle some black teens in the streets. The police can't imagine the threat they are facing isn't the gang.

The creature effects are practical with CGI embellishments, such as fur that doesn't reflect light and bioluminescent teeth. The result is a novel approach to aliens that makes them feel incomprehensible without being uncanny.

The movie isn't super gory. It has a couple of shockingly gross moments. I don't know if they work for the movie's tone.

John Boyega as Moses kills it. He has wordless moments that convey more humanity and depth of emotion than anything he got to do in the <i>Star Wars</i> movies. The rest of the kids are great, too — as the masks come off, the personalities emerge, and the story grows more character-driven.

Jodie Whittaker is stellar as well. Her role evolves throughout the movie, from a victim unwittingly consigned to joining her attackers as they all become victims of something bigger.

At some points, the film feels like it touches on gentrification and the system that turns kids into drug dealers in the first place. But it never sets up anything firm enough for it to be a developed theme.

It takes until the final five minutes for it all to come together. This movie is outstanding and entertaining. It's worth watching, even if you're not a genre fan.","max, hooptober, hooptober2.0, solidarity",2024-07-28

Orla arrives at a rural Irish farm. Dan, the farm owner, greets her as she grabs her gear. He takes Orla to a pregnant cow. Orla gloves up and lubricates it to check on the unborn calf. A chomping sound drives her to pull her hand out. She removes the glove to reveal a bleeding puncture wound. It seems like the unborn calf bit her.

Just outside of Dan's farm is a parked caravan. Dan goes out to it to tell the inhabitants, Jamie and Mary, to leave by morning. When Dan leaves, they formulate a plan. They appear to be hiding from someone. Jamie has done something, but he isn't sorry for it.

John from Bovine Genetics Technology stops by the farm to perform an ultrasound on the pregnant cow. John reminds Dan that John's company is paying for secrecy and that the caravan jeopardizes that. Orla shows John the hand wound, but he dismisses it as an accident. Still, Orla knows what happened and suggests terminating the pregnancy. But John is too invested.

That night, the cow goes into labor. Dan needs help but can't get through to anyone. So, he calls on Jamie and Mary for help. Jamie and Daniel work a pulley to help the calf breach. When it comes out, it isn't breathing, so Dan has to swing it over his head. The calf opens its eyes, but its mouth remains shut. Dan tries to pry it open, and the calf chomps down and mangles his hand.

What have they brought into the world? This calf is unusual. Through the movie, we'll learn just how extraordinary it is.

The Ireland Tourism Board had no hand in this movie. This movie's Ireland is wet, gray, and bleak. We feel trapped with these people on this farm. No one wants to be here.

The effects are all practical and quite grotesque. We get explicit cow labor and all sorts of surprise little nasties. The film is willing to go places I've seen similar movies avoid. If I described it, you might laugh because it sounds ridiculous, but the movie pulls it off.

The script has some melodrama between Dan and Orla. John Lynch plays it broad, but Essie Davis keeps it grounded and motivated.

A Brazilian tribe performs a ritual around a fire. John Whitney, an anthropologist for the Field Museum in Chicago, photographs the ritual, his camera flashes jolting through the ritual. The tribe prepares a tea with red-spattered leaves. They hand a cup to John, who cheerfully drinks it.

John arrives at the dock by taxi, drenched in sweat. The merchant ship's captain is sending out the last orders before departure. John begs the captain to remove the crates that John had loaded onto the ship for the Field Museum. But the captain is running late and has a manifest to abide by. So, John sneaks aboard the ship to find his cargo. It turns out the crates never made it on the boat.

<b>Chicago, Illinois, USA — 6 Weeks Later</b>
The ship John snuck onto has inexplicably arrived in Lake Michigan. Homicide detectives D’Agosta and Hollingsworth investigate the boat. Blood streaks and handprints spatter the outer hull. No one has found any bodies yet, but the detectives smell something horrendous coming from the bilge. They open it up to discover the crew's mangled and beheaded bodies.

<b>1 Week Later</b>
Dr. Margo Green arrives at the Field Museum, meeting with her mentor, Albert Frock. They go through the crates John Whitney sent to the museum, which were airmailed after the mixup at the docks. In the crates are a bed of leaves and a stone statue of the Kothuga, a Zenzeran deity born of Satan to destroy their enemies. The leaves are red-spattered, just like the ones in the tea John drank. Frock suggests burning the leaves and crates, as it may be a fungus. But Dr. Green, the curious scientist, has a couple of leaves set aside for analysis.

That night, Frederick, a security guard, sneaks into the bathroom to smoke. A monstrous hand reaches under the bathroom stall, dragging him out. We hear a horrific growl as Frederick screams. The following day, D’Agosta and Hollingsworth arrive on the scene to find one eerily similar to what they discovered on the ship.

I went to Chicago a few months back and toured the Field Museum. So, this was fun to watch if only to see that same place nearly 30 years ago.

The script has pure Save the Cat energy, with characters whose sole purpose is to expound ham-fisted dialogue. You know what, though? It works. I liked folks I knew almost nothing about and wanted to see them live. Horror is rarely great at that. I’m not saying this movie excels at it — just that it’s using a formula effectively.

We get D’Agosta’s superstitions vs. Dr. Green’s aversion to anything unscientific. When a cat spooks Hollingsworth on the ship, D’Agosta checks if it’s black. It isn’t, so he softens. When they investigate Frederick’s murder scene, D’Agosta chastises Hollingsworth for almost stepping over the body, which is bad luck. Meanwhile, Dr. Green resents John Whitney’s work with South American folklore and myths. She wants the museum to focus on the science. But Frock and the museum curator, Dr. Ann Cuthbert, know that folklore brings in guests. Whose worldview do you think the movie challenges?

The lighting isn’t great in a couple of places. It’s not an enormous deal, but I couldn’t get my room dark enough to see some scenes.

The monster design looks pretty great when it isn’t moving. They use CGI for its running scenes, and it is… fine. The bad lighting helps that, I suppose.

The movie is a tad too long and doesn’t stay consistently exciting, but if you need some 90s action horror, you could do worse.","hooptober, hooptober2.0, written by women, nature attacks",2024-07-29

Bobbie chastises Jack for blowing all his money when he could save for something bigger. He’s always making big plans for tomorrow because, as Bobbie put it, he’s already fucked up today. Jack is a pimp, and he’s not doing great.

Gig comes over to Jack’s. Jack gives Bobbie a gun, just in case. Gig says he found a girl he wants to give to Jack and make things right between them. Jack doesn’t trust Gig but checks it out anyway. Jack tries to upsell the girl, but the cops bust in and arrest Jack. When they turn on the lights, Jack realizes she's a child. As they take Jack out, Detective Mandingo tries to comfort the girl but ends up sounding eerily similar to Jack.

Laurette throws Zack’s 78s out of the house. Zack sits on the bed, moping. Zack is a DJ, and he’s burned his last bridge and can't find another job. So, Zack walks among all his broken records and strewn clothes out on the street.

Zack gets drunk and mopes outside a bar. Bob, an Italian tourist, starts a conversation with Zack, despite only speaking a little English. When Zack tells Bob to buzz off, Bob takes it as a compliment and writes it down for later before wandering off. Preston walks up and offers Zack a job. Zack doesn’t trust Preston but hears him out. Preston wants Zack to drive a car somewhere and leave it. Zack takes it, but a cop pulls him over on the trip. They keep him at gunpoint as they open the trunk. Inside is a dead body.

Who should meet each other at the jail but Jack and Zack? The film follows them as they figure out how to tolerate one another.

In true Jarmusch form, we have a film that, on paper, is a tense neo-noir, but is more often a character study. No, you won’t learn how Jack or Zach got set up, who the body is, or any of that. Hell, when they escape, we don’t have any clue how. As a formalist exercise, it’s amusing. And lord knows we’ve had enough prison escape movies. 

Somehow, Jim Jarmusch got the brilliant Robby Müller to do the cinematography. Müller would work with Jarmusch a few more times throughout his career, his last movie being Coffee and Cigarettes. The rich monochrome and eloquent camera placement add a dynamic missing from Stranger Than Paradise. Still, this is a movie where folks sit around and go through their feelings. It just also has a plot.

Joy N. Houck Jr. makes an appearance as Detective Mandino. 

John Lurie does the score for the movie, while Tom Waits provides a few songs. The two actors have good brotherly chemistry — that love-hate where they'll fight but still help each other.

I don’t like Roberto Benigni, but he’s the film’s sole source of life this movie has for long swaths. I’m glad he met his real-life wife, Nicoletta Nraschi while working on the movie. It never gets more dynamic than the opening with Laurette and the records. I don’t know, it’s quite good and even funny. I’m not always on Jarmusch’s wavelength, but this wasn’t as off-putting as some of his other flicks.

Also, John Lurie's hot, so that helps.","criterion channel, criterion, criterion challenge 2024, cc2024, 1001 movies",2024-07-29

<b>The year 2078. A mining colony on planet Sirius 6B.</b>
For the past 50 years, the New Economic Block (N.E.B.) has monopolized mining across solar systems, where a discovery on Sirius 6B of the energy-rich but hazardous element berynium led to devastating radiation and pollution. Despite The Alliance’s demands to halt mining, the N.E.B. declared war, resulting in severe civilian casualties and environmental destruction on Sirius 6B. Survivors now confront an unprecedented new threat.

Alliance soldiers gamble cigarettes over a game. One miner sees movement on a CCTV monitor. He checks the long-range binoculars to confirm an N.E.B. soldier. The soldier frantically marches across the waste-ridden desert. Everyone arms themselves but pauses when they realize the soldier is alone.

Suddenly, piercing screams burrow through the sand to attack the lone N.E.B. soldier. He takes them out, but more keep coming. The scream overwhelms him as their numbers increase. He holds a message in his hand, but the screams dismember him before burrowing into his skull and killing him. These are the Autonomous Mobile Swords, nicknamed Screamers, that the Alliance developed to fight the N.E.B. Still, the carnage sickens the Alliance soldiers and they smoke their winnings to calm the nausea.

Lieutenant Commander Chuck Elbarak dons his “tabs” that make him invisible to the Screamers so he can retrieve what the N.E.B. soldier held. He brings it to Commander Joseph A. Hendricksson, as the message priority is the highest possible. The message? The N.E.B. wishes to discuss a truce and offer safe passage to all those needed to facilitate the conversation.

While all this happens, a commercial freighter requests landing. They deny it without proper cause. Later that night, the ship crashes on the planet, killing all but one, Private “Ace” Jefferson. The ship also carries a nuclear reactor. Whatever’s going on, Ace knows something. So, Hendricksson and Ace cross Sirius 6B to start that peace treaty. On the way, they discover the world they’ve hidden from isn’t what it used to be.

Ace acts as our stranger in a strange world so that the characters can do the world-building on his behalf.

Peter Weller is essential to the film’s chemistry. His cavalier charm kept me invested. Jennifer Rubin is good, but they shit the bed on her story. Everyone else sucks pretty hard. The dude with teardrop tattoos makes me want to eat lead paint.

Despite Dan O’Bannon’s screenwriting credit, this isn’t his script. This film went through development hell, with O’Bannon optioning the script in 1983. When the movie finally came out in 1995, O’Bannon wasn’t aware. While they kept his characters and general plot, the dialogue was not his

The original Philip K. Dick story took place during the Cold War, so the film bends over backward to develop a new cold war scenario involving nukes and oil. It isn’t an allegory or theme, it’s just retooled history.

I like (most of) the story! You can see the seams of all the sci-fi cliches they bunched together, but it’s a compelling enough idea. I like the idea of folks hiding out in war so long that the world moves on around them and they have to dig themselves out and fill in the blanks. The movie messes it up with the third act, where it chases twists over reveals. It got so hacky that I had to lower my score.

The effects are corny and cheap. I’m a big fan of claymation robots, so I never minded them too much. But man, they ran out of kid actors for the Type 3s and it looks awful. But the close-ups are gross and neat. Also, I’m so basic — give me a good explosion or two, and I’ll hang around.

<b>19th century Haida Gwaii</b>
An elder carves a mask. Adiitsʹii binds the handle of a knife. He sees a boat come in. On it is Adiitsʹii’s friend, Gaas. He gives Gaas the knife.

Adiitsʹii carves up a halibut he caught with Kwa, Gaas’ father. Gaas asks about a black cod. Adiitsʹii jokes about Gaas being fat, and Kwa pushes Adiitsʹii onto the rocks, scratching up his back. Kwa and Hlaaya, his wife, believe Adiitsʹii is a poor example for Gaas, as he shows disrespect.

Kwa tells Gaas about reading the sky and understanding the weather. When Gaas asks if Adiitsʹii can read the sky, Kwa reluctantly confirms. When everyone has gathered enough food for the winter, they have one last meal together. But Adiitsʹii wants to catch a black cod for Gaas and wants to bring him along. Kwa warns him that the weather will worsen and that they must leave.

The following morning, Kwa wakes up to find Adiitsʹii and Gaas missing. He attempts to take a boat out, but cannot move it. Hlaaya trusts Adiitsʹii. But as the weather worsens and they still haven’t returned, Hlaaya runs along the shore. She finds Gaas’s dead body. Adiitsʹii, horrified by his mistake, runs into the forest, where his torment changes him.

<blockquote><i>The world is as sharp as the edge of a knife; as you go along, you have to be careful or you will fall off one side or the other.</i> — Haida proverb</blockquote>

The film began as an effort from the Haida filmmakers to preserve their endangered language. They worked closely with the Haida Nation to ensure the film accurately represented them before showing it to outsiders.

You can tell the actors have a tough time with the language. The major performances, however, help keep the film cohesive, especially Tyler York, who plays Adiitsʹii.

You can also tell that these are amateur filmmakers. The pacing is all over the place, and the cinematography is rough in places. The filmmakers were primarily indigenous people, though, so I understand that desire for it to be a film they make.

That said, the story is well-constructed. It is based on a traditional Haida narrative about an accident that causes a man to lose his humanity.

The film is full of symbolic imagery. For example, when Adiitsʹii runs into the wilderness, he chases fires that seem to appear and disappear. He chases them deeper in, but they are always out of reach.

The film effortlessly integrates rituals — celebration, mourning, storytelling — that help us see and understand facets of Haida culture.

I wouldn’t call this a great movie, but I’m glad it exists as a document of Haida culture.","acc2024, anti-criterion challenge 2024, written by women, directed by women, edited by women, folk horror: a study",2024-07-30

The camera descends into a dungeon. Men in chains and cages listen to the sounds of whips stinging flesh. One onlooker whips himself alongside each strike. We find the Marquis De Sade in the throes of passion as the whip hits him. He’s not supposed to be enjoying it. He suggests soaking the whip in vinegar. I guess they take a dropper of vinegar to one of his eyes, blinding that eye, and that finally stops him.

Duvall tries to mock Sade, but Sade torments him and performs some ritual that drives Duvall to pull his eyes out of their sockets. Sade paces about, rambling to a portrait of Madame de Beaumont, the woman who had him thrown in prison.

Bob Mattison weaves through an airport, running into Sabina. She hints at a past where Bob liked to be tied up, but Bob dismisses her as his daughter, Genie, arrives. That night, Bob prays over the meal while Genie watches. Bob’s maidservant, Fatima, serves them food. Bob discusses his work as a Christian archeologist and the big discovery of a Gnostic site — the first to be located.

But Genie ignores Bob’s warnings and allows Sabina to pull her deeper into her world.

Yoram Globus, head of Cannon Films, read a script his son, Rom Globus, wrote. Yoram tried to get Warner Brothers to make it, but Warner Brothers hated the script. Instead, Warner Brothers handed off a script to Rom that they were getting ready to make. They wanted Rom to rewrite it, but stick to the original concept: Egypt, a young girl losing her innocence, and Marquis De Sade.

Rom took the script to Daniel Matmor, who agreed to help him despite the three-week deadline they had. As they finished pages, a courier for the department heads would photocopy them and send them off so the other departments knew what to build.

Robert Englund had already signed onto the project to play Marquis De Sade when Gerry O’Hara was to direct. But once O’Hara saw the original script, he jumped ship. As the script changed, Englund wasn’t happy with the new direction. So, to appease their only big name, the producers asked Tobe Hooper. Hooper was already in an awful place, career-wise, but he liked the idea of doing something with De Sade and wanted to make something in the vein of Ken Russell.

Like much of Hooper’s work from this era, the film is fascinating but messy. It has some of the sleaze hinted at in <i>Lifeforce</i>, indulging in sex scene after sex scene, chasing that Ken Russell hypnotism. Genie, as she reads De Sade, enters a fantasy world.

Blood paints a nurse named Maud's face. A dead body lay on a hospital bed in St. Afra's. Her blood-soaked hands face upward in resignation. Across the ceiling walks a cockroach.

A year has passed. Maud lives in a town resembling Scarborough, with its seaside views and touristy amusements. She closes her window to block out the arguing neighbors, then prays over her tomato soup. She also asks God to watch over her in her next posting as a private nurse.

<blockquote><i>Forgive my impatience, but I hope you'll reveal your plan for me soon. I can't shake the feeling that you must have saved me for something greater than this.</i></blockquote>Her next assignment is live-in palliative care for Amanda Kohl, a 49-year-old American with stage four lymphoma of the spinal cord. Her crooked feet suggest she used to dance. She keeps a lit cigarette in her mouth all day. She is short in her responses but tolerant.

Amanda has Richard over one night, so Maud takes to the streets. She smiles when she finds a homeless man. She offers him some change and a blessing:

<blockquote><i>May God bless you and never waste your pain.</i></blockquote>Maud receives a buzz to return early as Amanda and Richard got too drunk and Amanda is having a hard time with all the liquor. As Maud helps her, Amanda asks about Maud's past. Maud explains how God changed her life and called her to her current work. She also shares how she hears God's voice, but more often feels God reward her with warm euphoria when she does something good.

Meanwhile, Amanda feels outside of reality. She thinks about death and what awaits her, if anything at all. Maud promises Amanda that there is more, and God won't let Amanda fall into oblivion. As Maud leaves Amanda, the lights flicker around her. She ascends the stairs slowly, overcome. She falls over, moaning in ecstasy. Back in her room, Maud pours pebbles on the floor and kneels before the cross she hangs in her room, her knees on the sharp rocks.

God has given Maud her purpose: to save Amanda Kohl's soul. Maud will have to deal with the people in Amanda's life who distract her from her noble purpose.

Maud suffers from chronic pain. She associates this pain with God, where the more miserable the pain, the further she is straying from God's purpose for her. If something offends God, Maud may also experience a nosebleed or more intense menstrual pain. But if God is pleased, he gives Maud almost erotic pleasure. Like many women, Maud hides secrets spelled out in self-inflicted scars. When the physical pain is insufficient, Maud self-inflicts pain to teach and remind her.

My most religious years were 16-20. During that time, I felt bright flashes, like lightning going through my body. My heart would beat so hard I thought it was ripping. I felt an ameliorative warmth at just saying Jesus' name. I would write pages and pages of prayers, my hands growing weak, the words becoming jumbled. This convinced me that Satan was stopping my hand and that I must persist. I also had the feeling that I needed to beat myself into submission, physically fighting away sinful desires.

I wanted the big things figured out — to feel like I had some control over my life — to silence that loud voice in my head that something was wrong with me. Because if the problem isn't that I needed God, what could I possibly change?

Unlike Maud, I forged friendships with people, believers or otherwise, which helped ground me and ultimately see that I couldn't believe what I did anymore. Without those friends, I don't think Maud and I's paths would have been all that different. I'm also on medication now, which also does wonders.

Like <i>Love Lies Bleeding</i>, the film lives in Maud's subjective experience, so everything feels possible — transcendence and complete oblivion.

Morfydd Clark's performance is pitch-perfect. I felt in lockstep with Maud's experiences, which made the film physically unbearable in places.

This film has one of the most horrifying last images I've seen in a movie.

Michael Corland courts fellow textile industrialist, Alan Birnley, in hopes of Birnley purchasing his mill. Mr. Corland is also courting Birnley’s daughter, Daphne. Birnley is stoic throughout the tour until he encounters an unusual and complex chemistry setup emitting a rhythmic gurgling. No one on the tour or in the lab can explain it. The accounting team looks into it while the tour continues, discovering that, whatever it is, they’ve invested £4000 on it.

Through the process of elimination, they discover it is a personal project of research chemist Sidney Stratton. They discharge him for misleading them — Sidney’s seventh firing in a row. After the madcap display, Birnley decides not to invest in Corland’s mill. The Employment Exchange finds Sidney a brute labor position at Birnley Mills. Sidney takes it because they have a lab and facilities he could use. When he’s not working, or on a union-mandated tea break, he works on his formulas and surveys the lab.

When Birnley Mills receives an electron microscope, Sidney will bring it into the lab. Once there, Sidney stops one of the lab workers from misusing it and shows them where all the microscope components are. His expertise leads the lab to offer him an unpaid temporary position to help them use it while they learn the ropes.

Daphne catches Sidney in her father’s mill. Since Sidney cost her fiance her father’s investment, she threatens to tell her father. Stanley begs her not to, giving her the lowdown on his work. In short, he has developed a fabric that repels dirt and never wears out.

The film critiques the capitalist system that produces brilliant minds through expensive education, but no mechanisms to put these minds in positions where they would be of use. When Stratton takes on the labor position at Burnley, he joins their union. His coworkers are furious at him for taking on scab labor.

By most accounts, clothes that never wear out would be tremendous. In a system requiring continuous growth, selling a product you never have to replace is risky. Because it doesn’t just affect the mill, but the producers and retailers who have invested. The union workers at the factory worry about what will happen to them too.

Alec Guinness gives a charming performance as a brilliant but naïve scientist who believes success can occur in a vacuum.

On the shores of Dartmouth sits a white house. There lives Jonathan Osborne, a 14-year-old boy who loves boats. One morning, just before daybreak, Jonathan sneaks out to meet with other boys. Their leader is a boy named Chief, who smokes a cigar and gives the boys a book on sex positions to drool over. But when they get too excited, Chief chastises them and takes the book.

Jonathan’s mother, Anne, worries about what he gets up to, but Jonathan keeps his lips shut. Anne is still in mourning over her husband, who died three years earlier. When she grounds Jonathan, he finds a peephole in his room that allows him a full view of Anne’s bedroom. Through this, he develops an unhealthy fixation on her.

Meanwhile, Chief preaches some bastardization of Nietzsche to the gang — morality is meaningless and whatnot. Of course, they have no idea what he’s talking about.

One day, a large shipping vessel arrives, and Anna arranges for Jonathan to get a tour. Jim Cameron, the second officer of the ship, shows them around. Anne falls for him and his weird shark fixation.

I don’t understand the boys at all. Like, I can’t get into any of their heads. I get the sense that their language and world are more developed in the novel. Here, Jonathan says bizarre things out of nowhere about perfection.

The film starts weird as hell, but then it tries to make something sentimental out of Anne and Jim’s relationship. Perhaps we’re meant to feel those contrasts, but Kris Kristofferson doesn’t feel right in the role.

The devil, Malebolgia, has sent a lieutenant to Earth to recruit men to turn the world into a place of death in exchange for wealth and power — a place that provides enough souls to complete his army and allow Armageddon to begin. All the Dark Lord needs now is a great soldier, someone who can lead his hordes to the gates of Heaven and burn them down.</i></blockquote>Al Simmons, a CIA operative, shoots up the air traffic control tower of a military air base in Hong Kong. When everyone is dead, he unpacks a cute little rocket launcher and dons some special goggles to survey the landing field and find his targets. When he positively identifies the four, he launches his rocket, which breaks out into four mini-rockets. But it doesn’t matter, because the entire plane blows up so everyone else dies along with the four targets. That wasn’t supposed to happen.

Simmons tries to quit, but Wynn won’t let him until he completes one last mission — infiltrate a biochemical weapons plant in North Korea. When Simmons gets there, Wynn and an assassin named Priest are waiting for him. Priest then douses Simmons with fuel. Wynn tosses his cigarette at Simmons, lighting him on fire. “See you in Hell,” says Wynn before throwing him a salute.

Simmons wakes up, covered in burn scars. He doesn’t know it, but five years have passed. Malebolgia kept him imprisoned in hell before offering him a deal — he could return to Earth if he became the outstanding soldier who would lead Hell’s army in Armageddon. I’m unsure why he must forget that, but here we are.

To call this movie “directed” would be an overstatement. These poor actors are kind of doing whatever, and no one comes out looking good.

Horror fans know this film best as a proto-<i>Scream</i>. In 1992, the slasher was dead. This script knew that and tried to play with the genre by pumping the movie with as many cliches as possible. The result lacks the dialed-in humor and intelligence of Scream.

But it's only when he works with Carla Kessler, a 70-year-old woman who wants to finally have her bat mitzvah, that he learns how to speak for himself.

Ben is the sort of schmuck for schmucks — his grief is a selfish beast that toys with the people in his life while he uses them to get what he wants. The film is no one's story but his, and so even the proverbial love interest is a projection — her pain is his mirror to find himself in, and her desires are only granted in the most rote way.

Frankie Dunlan lives in the gap between traumatic reenactment and repression. The sound of gunfire ricochets through an endless echo. What is beautiful is also dangerous — the line between innocent and perpetrator bleeds into one another.

Frankie’s crying child warps into inhuman synthetic warbles — its face, deformed from Frankie’s exposure to chemical weapons. His pregnant wife, Cathy, complains about the lack of food and the poverty of their daily lives. He can’t find a job — his lack of marketable skills makes it difficult.

His father raised him to care about himself and himself only. Frankie doesn’t believe in that. When he can’t find a way out, what choice does he have? Frankie cannot rectify that the country he fought for left him like a rat on the street. Something is wrong. How can he make it right?

When Frankie has flashbacks, the film flickers and speeds up — cuts and zooms briefly pull us into his internal reality. From a visual perspective, this movie is bleak and focused.

For whatever reason, however, the film injects constant narration and audio flashbacks, making literal what was already apparent by the circumstances.

The film can feel like <i>Eraserhead</i>, but with the surrealism stripped away. That may be because of the baby’s effects and its constant crying.

The score is pretty terrific — it reminds me of Angelo Badalamenti, but heavier on the synths.

The film is exploitative. Despite the subject and budget, it does its best to remain grounded. It left me feeling pretty down, which is the intent, and it pretty successfully captured the hopelessness that those in poverty feel.

In the right hands, this story could have felt closer to <i>Taxi Driver</i> or <i>Christiane F</i>.

So, I didn't come to this doc expecting to learn much but rather to see some of that killer behind-the-scenes footage of him working with David Bowie, Talking Heads, and, to a lesser extent, U2.

The problem with an algorithm choosing from 100s of hours of footage — or perhaps just this algorithm — is that it doesn't have a concept of pacing or variability.

So, our version was wall-to-wall Eno talking, with maybe 4 minutes of Bowie, 3 minutes of U2, and nothing regarding Talking Heads. We visited a few cool places in his history, but it was far from comprehensive or linear.

With 40 minutes left, I was ready to leave the movie. But we waited it out because it could have changed. It didn't.

You may ask, then, why I am giving this three stars. A) I like Brian Eno, and hearing an hour of him talking was enjoyable, bordering on inspiring.

It's Halloween night and the kids are out. Dressed as a robot, Emma blows out their jack-o'-lantern, ready to call it. Henry. dressed as a 50s sci-fi spaceman, warns her against it, reminding her that it's supposed to stay lit until after midnight. But it's too late.

Thus, the anthology sets up its theme: respect the Halloween traditions, or Sam will have to punish you. Who is Sam? The credits introduce us to him in his orange footie costume and a burlap sack over his head.

Unlike most anthologies, this film interlaces the four stories, letting them develop in tandem. When tensions are building, the film will focus on one story to let it conclude.

The credits suggest that these stories come from a fictitious comic book a la Creepshow, with the comic aesthetic continuing in the interstitials.  

This film's greatest strength is that it tells fairly conventional Halloween stories, not trying to break new ground or subvert troupes.

Welcome to Valentine Bluffs, a mining town in the heart of Canada. A group of miners gets off their shift and races down to the diner, where their beaus are preparing for the first Valentine's Day Dance the town has held in 20 years. The mayor, who reinstated the dance, receives an anonymous box of chocolates—inside is a human heart.

<blockquote><i>It's happening again. It can't be happening again.</i></blockquote>

What's happening again? The fulfillment of a promise made 20 years ago — that if the town held another Valentine's Day Dance, a crazed miner would kill again. The mayor assumes the same killer, but perhaps it's someone in their midst? The easy solution? Don't have the party. But the miners aren't going to let the mayor spoil their fun.

Unlike the burgeoning slashers of the time, this film is not focused on a group of teens killed one by one but on a small town with history and the humans just trying to make their meager existence a little better. That said, the movie reeks of melodrama, especially with TJ and Sarah's relationship.

This film has some gruesome kills! I think I watched the restored version because the goriest shots looked unpolished compared to the rest of the film. The miner in a gas mask looks perfect and is creepy as hell.

If you don't like slashers, this will feel like another holiday-themed kill fest. Otherwise, this film has a tremendous atmosphere. The scene with Sylvia in the back of the truck is legitimately great filmmaking.

A showdown between John Huston and an eight-year-old named Katy Collins. A blonde-haired, blue-eyed Jesus surrogate teaching bald children about the ancient rivalry between the alien prisoner Zatteen and Yahweh. The unremarkable skyline of Atlanta, Georgia, set to Franco Micalizzi's epic score.

These are our introductions to Giulio Paradisi's star-studded sci-fi escapade. Sounds sick, right? It's too bad it tames after this.

There are a few laugh-out-loud scenes. The gun at the birthday party is pretty great. Also, the exchange where the new housekeeper proclaims, ""Capricorns are the worst!"" and then Katy emerges to exclaim, ""I'm a Capricorn!"" as the score grows tense. The ice skating rink scene is pretty wild.

Critics at the time unfairly compared this to <i>The Exorcist</i>, <i>The Birds</i>, <i>The Omen</i>, and any horror movies with vaguely similar elements. But critics were also dead-set on anything Italian being a rip-off of something from Hollywood.

Bodies litter the city streets. A church sign reads, ""The End Has Come."" An alarm awakens Dr. Robert Morgan, the last living man on earth. The walls mark the calendar days since the end began three years ago. A ring of garlic cloves and a broken mirror adorn the exterior door.

Outside, Morgan kicks over the bodies that lay in his yard — victims of the disease that has taken over the world. Still, Morgan has not given up his search for any other survivors. He prepares a bag of sharpened stakes to protect himself before hitting the road and continuing his slow canvasing of the city.

This film is the first adaptation of Matheson's <i>I Am Legend</i>. The book also influenced <i>Night of the Living Dead</i> a few years later. The diseased, while vampires in spirit, behave much closer to Romero's zombies—slow, ambling creatures with violent urges.

Like the novel, the film explores hubris and the ill-fated notion of heroic individualism. Morgan blames himself for ignoring the tell-tale signs of the impending disease and seeks to make things right. Unlike the novel, the film diverges in the fallout of Morgan's choices — I won't say more and risk spoiling it.

I imagine this will be boring for many people — you know where it's going, and it doesn't get there fast. Still, I could watch a movie of Vincent Price eating a sandwich, so that was never a concern of mine.

Steve and Jane make out at Lovers' Lane. A whistling red meteor falls from the sky. Steve speeds off in his Plymouth Cranbrook convertible, establishing first-time lead Steve McQueen as a car guy.

A barking dog wakes old man Barney. Oil lamp in tow, he goes out to see what has the dog in a fit. There, he finds the meteor, no bigger than a softball. He pokes the meteor with a stick. The rock is soft and cracked. Inside lay a small, mucusy blob. Barney pulls it onto his stick. The glob rushes up the rock, overtaking Barney and sending him racing into the woods.

Barney emerges from the woods. Steve accidentally hits Barney with his car. Steve and Jane pick up Barney and take him to Dr. Hallen. When they pull back the blanket over Barney's hand, the blob on Barney's hand has grown bigger.

This film established Steve McQueen as a leading man. It was also Burt Bacharach's big break with his theme for The Blob.

A bolt of lightning strikes the grave. Her wish may come true.

The film is a visual feast. It's more exciting when it references Victorian clothing and early film but the 80s stuff is cute. Every outfit comes from some 80s/90s thing, from <i>Dirty Dancing</i> to <i>Blossom</i>, Madonna to <i>Heathers</i>—a lot of <i>Heathers</i>.

The Creature is an understandable fantasy — a Victorian gentleman who is musically talented and can't talk, dedicated to your every whim (a back massager scene shows just how dedicated). He'll be a pre-fab choice for sex bots when those become a thing.

The script is funny, but I have no idea why Lisa does half the things she does. One moment, she's Winona Ryder in <i>Heathers</i>, another she's Angela Bettis in <i>May</i>. I see the vision — another Diablo Cody ""unlikeable protagonist"" (aka a woman with a personality) — but I don't feel like she comes together in the end.

Danny Elfman's oomph-pah from hell takes us through the familiar streets of Winter River, Connecticut. But it's all a set for Ghost House, a TV talk show about paranormal experiences. Lydia hosts, offering solace to folks with haunted homes. In a flash, she believes she sees Betelgeuse in the audience, sending her into a spiral.

A call from her stepmother, Delia, sends Lydia racing to find her. Lydia's father, Charles, is dead. The family reunites at the Winter River home for the funeral.

It takes half this movie to establish what the hell it's about, so yadda yadda yadda, somehow, Betelgeuse returned.

<i>Beetlejuice</i> is one of my favorite movies — a childhood flawed gem I can never see objectively. Part of the movie's specialness is how much whole-cloth weirdness comes at you with little explanation.

Here, everything we see is either from that movie or so thoroughly explained that it leaves the viewer begging for an escape — you know, like the waiting room in the Netherworld. While a couple of the references are fun, most are so empty that I curled up into myself. The kid choir singing <i>Day-O</i> is one of many reasons Tim Burton can never enter the kingdom of Heaven.

Monic Bellucci shows up as Betelgeuse's ex-wife, who is sucking souls and whatnot. But don't worry, the movie sidelines her story until the last 15 minutes.

I appreciate that Burton toned down the CGI effects compared to his recent output. The CGI isn't gone — CGI pretending to be claymation is still CGI. Still, the film has some zany practical effects. Some of the visuals are disgusting, which I dig.

I also love seeing Michael Keaton do a comedic role again, even if it's a character thoroughly explored 30 years ago.

The two try to live their lives in their decadent mid-century modern home. Through home movies, we see how much Isaac loved James. Laura, not so much. But Isaac has no next of kin so Laura will be his guardian.

Isaac cannot shake the feeling that his father was not dead when they pulled the life support.

This film is yet another meditation on grief — a theme that has dominated popular horror for a while now. I tend not to care when the movie has enough spoops and ideas. Here, the ideas are small and do not warrant the runtime.

It's difficult not to compare this to <i>The Babadook</i>. This movie has taken so much from it that it's hard not to think of it as a spiritual remake. The obvious difference is that the film substitutes <i>The Babadook</i>'s subtext for text.

The best part of the movie is Laura — her pain feels genuine as she refuses to step up as a parent and tries to drink her grief away. But of course, it's not that simple.

Also, The Prodigy's Destroy plays during a major scene, so that kind of rules.

Stones, a journalist with gastrointestinal problems, documents the group's day-to-day activities while trying to remain separate. Still, as a writer, he assumes his identity will imprint on the final result — to what degree he cannot imagine.

Stones is the blocked artist who believes he only produces shit. He performs his bowel movements in fearful secrecy. Its pervasiveness is a disease that he cannot understand. And with a doctor provided by the Institute, he can't seem to get a straight answer.

The film pokes fun at the art world's pretensions and pseudo-intellectualism. It explores the dishonesty that some artists employ to form a coherent narrative around themselves and their work. People of privilege assume the role of transgressor while never risking the safety net of their upbringing, leaving the real work of making art to the would-be underlings.

But to an audience, what is the difference between the truth and the performance? The abjection lives in the deception. For whatever honesty a movie demands in its making, it is ultimately a fabrication. The shit is fake, but we can believe it's real in the context of the story. The artificial can still produce the desired nausea and confrontation.

I made an excellent decision by listening to the soundtrack/score before watching the movie. Watching this in my dad's home theater also enhanced the experience. Like the director's other movies, sound is essential to the texture and storytelling. The more overwhelming the experience can be, the better.

Gwendolyn Christie is a muse — her otherworldly beauty hovering like an angel of death. The way they mutter ""Jan Stevens"" whenever she shows up never gets old.

A small-town inn puts on a picture show. Folks sit in dining room chairs. A woman accompanies the movie on piano. While this happens, a woman leaves the theater for her room. In her closet, beady eyes watch her.

The sound of thumps and glass shattering sends the concierge from the theater to the room. He barges in to find the place ransacked and the woman on the floor strangled to death. The constable investigates — this murder is the third in a series that has rattled the community. All the victims share one commonality: they were women who lived with a physical disability.

Helen, a mute woman, leaves the movie and walks home alone. She fits the killer's MO. In a house full of men, who can she trust?

Robert Sidomak brilliantly combines film noir aesthetics and conversation with a horror story. The film also utilizes melodrama conventions, giving us a cast of respectable men. Anyone could be the killer.

Nicholas Musuraca, a cinematographer and RKO regular, brings a similarly gothic and subtle eye to the film. The film will jump into the killer's perspective, giving us his surreal and warped worldview. When he sees Helen, he sees her with no mouth.

This movie is pure exploitation — semi-nude women, animal violence (strangling a cat and eating its eyeball), and hack science run amuck. I guess it's also a loose adaptation of Poe's The Black Cat.

Dante attempts to ascend the hill of salvation, but the beasts Avarice, Pride, and Lust block his bath. So, the poet Virgil guides Dante through the Nine Circles of Hell so that Dante may learn to recognize and reject sin.

With trippy special effects, intricate sets, and nude bodies for days, this film has perhaps the best depiction of hell I've seen in a movie.

My only complaint is the frequent and text-heavy interstitials — they're necessary for the story, but I wish they could just let the images speak for themselves.

<i>Paris 1890</i>

On a foggy night, a shadowy figure accosts a man, knocking him unconscious. The shadowy figure produces surgical tools. He performs his work in silence and slips away before anyone notices.

Meanwhile, Dr. Georges Bonnet hosts an elegant party to unveil his most recent sculpture. When a servant tells him the time, Bonnet ends the party, sending everyone home.

Margo, the sculpture's model, stays behind, unbeknownst to Bonnet. She approaches him to ensure they will see each other again. But she witnesses Bonnet's eyes change, with bags forming underneath them. His skin greens as he covers Margot's screaming mouth. She feints when he pulls his hand away, his handprint burned into her face.

Bonnet rushes to a safe, producing and drinking a green serum. His skin and eyes return to their original color. While the title may reveal Bonnet's secret, the method is more complicated than it seems.

The film is a mad scientist Picture of Dorian Gray, but Bonnet is already long gone by the time we meet him, willing to risk and take anything to keep his secret and his life. As a result, the film is quite talky, as most of the compelling story beats happened before the movie began.

Still, the film manages an entertaining and chaotic third act.

This film is a rare Hammer picture in which Christopher Lee does not play the villain. Anton Diffring plays Bonnet in a role that Peter Cushing would have killed if he had not just finished <i>The Hounds of Baskerville</i> and needed a break. But Diffring does a fine job, albeit difficult to empathize with.

As many have said, this isn't an A-tier Hammer film, and certainly one of Terence Fischer's worst, but their production quality and roster of actors keep the movie from being a total mess.","tubi, hooptober, hoop-tober, britsploitation",2025-01-02

On Petrie's Island, a fictional island off the coast of Ireland, Dr. Lawrence Phillips receives a shipment from the mainland. Dr. Phillips believes he has a cure for cancer and is carrying it out despite lacking the clearance to do so. He spends all his time in his secluded castle lab, so the other islanders can only speculate about his activities.

Ian Bellows makes his way home as night falls. He hears a sound and, like a horror victim, inspects the sound. Ian's wife visits the constable, worried that Ian hasn't returned. The constable searches for Ian. He finds Ian's body, but it has no bones — ""a horrible mush with the eyes sitting in it.""

What happened to Ian? Is this related to Dr. Phillips's research? The islanders can't find answers, so they contact mainland Dr. Brian Stanley.

Terence Fischer and Peter Cushing teamed up for the rare non-Hammer collaboration. The sci-fi bent of the story contrasts with Hammer's more Gothic leanings.

The 50s wore out sci-fi horror, so in 1966, this film was a little old hat. Still, the filmmaking is sharp and contains all the dry Britishisms that Fischer was known for.

Also, the movie is quite gory, which is a nice change of pace from the sterile 50s sci-fi flick.

The movie echoes a myth that Napoleon invented Solitaire, but we don't have any evidence of him doing so.

A runaway train careens off the rails. A car crashes into a wall, erupting in smoke. A biplane dives out of the sky and into the ground. All around the world, living things are suddenly dropping dead.

An American survivor drives a truck around an English village, looking for anyone else who may have survived. He takes his rifle and radio to a local hotel. There, he comes across a few other survivors.

One survivor, a woman named Vi, sees men in unrecognizable space suits outside and goes to greet them. When they turn around, Vi sees that they're not human. They kill her and move along.

In just over one hour, this tightly-paced, low-budget British piece gives us a tense sci-fi story. The characters aren't much, and the script has little to say. That said, the space suit creature designs are super cool and it never idles long enough to lose my interest.

Avant-garde composer Elisabeth Lutyens does the score. The film uses it sparingly, letting quiet moments of tension erupt.

A flashback takes us two movies back, to the end of Hammer's <i>Dracula</i>, where we witness the showdown between Van Helsing and Dracula. Van Helsing uses a cross to push Dracula into the sunlight, and Dracula collapses into dust.

In this film, four British tourists come to Transylvania to visit Karlsbad, but a series of misfortunes forces them to take shelter in the castle of the late Count Dracula.

Klove, a servant who oversees the castle, welcomes them, but he has a plot up his sleeve. He intends to resurrect the Count.

Van Helsing does not appear in this film, leaving the heroism to Charles Kent, one of the British tourists. They receive advice from Father Sandor, including a warning not to go to Karlsbad.

There exists an apocryphal story of Christopher Lee refusing to read any of the lines he had in the script because the script sucked so badly. Jimmy Sangster, the screenwriter, claims otherwise, and the script had no lines for Dracula. Sangster wrote the screenplay under a pseudonym, so take that for what you will.

I love Barbara Shelley. She's the only reasonable person alive on Earth, and bless her for it.

This film has so many little moments that heighten the experience. Watch how the filmmakers use red in scenes where a character is in danger. Also, this movie has plenty of that Gothic dread I crave.

Hunter dons her galoshes and trench coat as she scoops leaves out of her upstate New York house pool. Her husband, Richard, gets ready for work, leaving Hunter to perform the domestic duties. Richard's wealthy parents bought them the house. Hunter tries to adapt to the constrained freedom of domestic life. Richard is always locked to his phone, leaving Hunter feeling alone even when Richard sits across from her. To Richard, Hunter is the trophy who sits on the mantel of his perfect life.

The movie uses Richard's mother to convey the transformation Hunter must make if she will adapt to this lifestyle. All of it lives in that familiar presupposition that you are lucky to be alive and to have the privileges life affords you. If you are unhappy, then you must change, not your circumstances.

<blockquote><i>This is it. This is the best it's ever going to get.</i></blockquote>

After a positive pregnancy test, Richard's parents take Hunter and Richard to dinner. Richard prods Hunter to tell an uncomfortable childhood story, suggesting her lower-class upbringing, but Richard's father interrupts to discuss business with Richard. So, Hunter shoves an ice cube in her mouth and crunches it.

Richard's mom gives Hunter a self-help book about finding joy. A passage reads, ""Every day, try to do something unexpected. Push yourself to try new things."" So, Hunter finds a marble and swallows it.

I'm a massive fan of Todd Haynes's <i>Safe</i>. This film must take inspiration from <i>Safe</i>, the way it depicts women's domestic isolation and the mental toll it takes on their well-being. <i>Safe</i> allows us to understand our lead's choices from start to finish, even as they horrify us. Here, the film is more heavy-handed with how it progresses, pulling in Hunter's upbringing and therapy sessions instead of allowing us to see the person in front of us.

It's also a visceral and stomach-churning experience. While Hunter's pica begins with a marble, it quickly escalates to a thumbtack, a battery, and so on.

Haley Bennett gives an outstanding performance. The filmmakers opt out of the exploitation horror film that this could have been. They care about the character and want us to sympathize with her. Unfortunately, they still handle the material well, taking some well-trodden routes (and a poorly considered one) that distance us from Hunter.

I appreciate several aspects of this movie. I wanted to like it more, but the filmmakers underserve the material they're dealing with.","amc+, oh my horror, omh, omh2025, body horror, house of psychotic women",2025-01-06

In 18th-century Spain, a jailed beggar rapes a mute servant and dies. The servant escapes to the forest, where Don Alfredo Corledo and his housekeeper Teresa care for her. The unnamed servant dies giving birth to a child on Christmas Day, whom Alfredo and Teresa raise, naming him Leon. To be born on Christmas Day is considered ""unlucky."" So, Leon learns that an evil spirit is attached to him at birth, transforming him into a werewolf.

Oliver Reed was born to play a werewolf, and Reed does a swell job here. This movie was his first starring role, and he gives it all the sweat and desperation it needs. I like the transformation! Oliver Reed, mid-shift, has the panged ""looked what you made me do"" grimace down.

Man, I don't know about this one. It feels like Hammer is trying to elevate its style, but it lives in some middle ground where I can appreciate pieces but find the whole pretty uninteresting. It spends half its runtime giving us the werewolf's origin story, complete with Chekov's silver-crucifix-smelted-into-a-bullet-for-emergencies-only.

At the same time, I can dig how the movie attempts to create a rounded character with Leon — something every other werewolf movie avoids except maybe <i>An American Werewolf in London</i>. Also, whether it intends it or not (in the 60s, almost certainly not), it acts as a tremendous STD metaphor.

Hammer traded their signature Gothic dread for full-blown tragedy — a man cursed at birth to hurt the ones he loves and dies. Hammer never returned to the werewolf. Maybe the filmmakers said everything they could on the subject. Perhaps they knew it didn't work.

The more I think about the movie, the more I like it. But I'll withhold a star rating until I give it more thought.","hooptober, hoop-tober, werewolves, britsploitation, frightfest guide to exploitation movies",2025-01-06

Michelle ran away from a religious asylum. Upon return, the nuns keep her constrained in her room. Because she will not speak, they take her at odd hours to a room where they spray her with ice-cold water, then return her to the confines of a straightjacket.

One day, Michelle notices a new patient named Marie, who quietly sits in a rocking chair all day. Marie comes to Michelle's room and helps Michelle out of her straightjacket. Michelle wants to escape, but Marie wants to understand, in her words, what is ""wrong with her.""

<blockquote><i>They say I'm sick. Very sick. But I try to find out what's wrong and I can't. I'm afraid of everything. Sometimes, my whole body shakes.</i></blockquote>

Still, the two escape at night to discover the world outside the asylum walls.

<blockquote><i>— This other place; Where is it?
— It starts outside these walls and ends wherever we want.</i></blockquote>

As the two travel forward, their past catches up to them in memories they would rather forget. Their identities emerge in light of one another, for better or worse.

The film explores the meaning of artistry and how it manifests in an exploitative world. Who we are and what we want must always filter through capital's demands. If we cannot meet those demands, we are diagnosed and put in asylums. Those who live on the margins are the ones who cannot play along and would rather risk the edges than the asylums. But even they have rules — what is community but a shared ethos? The question then becomes: whose rules do you fear more?

The two women join up with a troupe of traveling exotic dancers. Notably, all the dancers are black women for sale for ""something extra."" From Michelle's perspective, these women have a freedom she longs to know. But once inside, the romantic ideal fades, and the transactional nature comes into light.

This film is a bit of an outlier for Jean Rollin. Similar to <i>The Night of the Hunted</i>, which deals with memory and disillusion, this film suggests that the sex-centered power that his lesbian vampires exude in other films is not the liberation it appears to be. I felt <i>The Night of the Hunted</i> suffered from uneven storytelling and reliance on titillation. This film takes a less voyeuristic approach (until the last 20 minutes).

An ice skating scene at the middle point is such a transcendent moment.

It's also worth mentioning that one of the exotic dancers performs to a disco interpolation of Für Elise.

As a child, a family adopted Laura from Good Shepherd Orphanage. Thirty years later, Laura brings her husband, Carlos, and their son, Simón, to the now-closed orphanage. Laura intends to reopen it as a facility for children with disabilities.

Simón has an active imagination. Laura encourages his imagination and plays along. One day, Laura finds him whispering to a boy named Tomás. Of course, Laura cannot see him.

Soon, Simón's friend grows to six. He tells Laura about a treasure hunt they have set up in which the winner gets a wish. Laura plays along, convinced that Simón set up the hunt himself. During the game, Simón uncovers his adoption papers. He reveals that Tomás told him that Simón is adopted. And that he will die.

The Guillermo Del Toro comparisons are expected—he, after all, helped produce the film. The film has a separate writer, director, and Del Toro's guidance, so there is more room for creative development.

So many contemporary horror movies aim for the slow burn with an explosive finale. What often happens is the film is boring. Here, we have a prime example of how to develop your story without boring the audience. Still, it's long for a horror movie and could probably use some cuts for pacing, but nothing significant.

For horror veterans, this film won't do much surprising. Instead, we have all the genre expectations and dread seeing how it plays out.","torrent, hoop-tober, hooptober, haunted house, frightfest guide to ghost movies, edited by women",2025-01-08

After some vague images, we meet our heroes, a group of shitty cops (the only kind there is, am I right?). One tells a story about how a trans woman tricked him. They harass the server for laughing at a joke and beat him up. A cop gets sick and sees a frog — an auspicious sign, I reckon.

Twenty minutes later, the cops get a call to go out to Inceagac. What awaits them? For one, more frogs. But we'll have to wait half the movie before they even arrive. Then….

I watched some of the director's shorts before this. If I can say anything, he likes gore—no need to motivate it, just scenes of grotesque violence for its own sake.

I'm reticent to call this a movie — just a whisper of character and story to paste together a parade of ""pretty gross, yeah?"" As a short film, this would be fine.

I came into this movie expecting the Charles Band I know from <i>Gingerdead Man</i> and <i>Evil Bong</i>. But this movie has actual production value and a pretty funny script (for the 80s). The movie winks at its influences, never claiming to be as serious in its intentions, allowing for a fun and breezy story.

Joong-ho is a pimp. He sends out one of his girls, Sung-hee, only for the customer to try and secretly film her. When Sung-hee finds out, she tries to leave, but the customer hits her. So, she calls Joong-ho, who comes and settles the matter. How? We don't know, but it involved a money exchange.

Through Sung-hee and Joong-ho's conversation, we learn that two girls are missing — Joong-ho believes they ran away, but Sung-hee believes otherwise. We also know that Joong-ho used to be a detective. Sung-hee runs off while Joong-ho gets a call about a customer rejecting all their girls. So, Joong-ho sends Mi-jin, who has a cold but of course Joong-ho doesn't care.

While fumbling around in the car, Joong-ho finds one of the missing girls' phones. He sees that the last number called was the same one as the customer Mi-jin went to see. Joong-ho believes the customer is selling his girls. The truth, however, is much worse. Joong-ho tries to wrangle in his old police buddies, but they have their own problems. So Joong-ho will have to take matters into his own hands.

Like <i>Memories of Murder</i>, the film deals with police incompetence. In some ways, it's incompetence all around. No one is good at what they're doing, and they pay for their endless mistakes. This movie would end in 30 minutes if people didn't make so many logical leaps.

The filmmaking complements this incompetence, letting the camera roll throughout the struggle. The resulting tension is more effective (and frustrating) than your traditional crime thriller. The closest comparison would be <i>The Nice Guys</i> or a Coen Brothers movie. But way bleaker.

<blockquote><i>New York City, 1984. Crime is at an all-time high. Gangs of drugged-out punks roam the streets, preying on the innocent. A rash of kidnappings involving young women has gripped the city with fear… The citizens of New York are fed up. The city needs hope. The city needs… <b>a hero</b>.</i></blockquote>

When a street gang kills his pregnant wife, John becomes the hero the city needs — a vigilante ninja. But is he prepared for the outrageous antics of the Plutonium Killer?

Actor/director John Lius started making this movie back in 1984. Their budget was slim — a mere $100 for special effects, which all went towards the Plutonium Killer's scenes. Then, before they could finish filming, the production studio shut down.

The footage lived on the shelves until a few years ago, when Vinegar Syndrome rediscovered the footage and worked on putting together a complete movie. While they did not film any additional footage, they hired Voyag3r to do the score and several B-movie A-listers, such as Cynthia Rothrock and Linnea Quigley, to dub the lines.

The result is remarkable for what it is. The key phrase is ""for what it is."" Though innately goofy, the original filmmakers seemed earnest. Vinegar Syndrome matched that earnestness, giving this movie a heart that elevates the material.

It would never have been a great movie and may have stayed forgotten if finished in 1984. Today, the market for ""so bad it's good"" movies is only growing.

Oscar winner Elisabeth Sparkle once shined brightly in Hollywood. But, like so many women in the industry, her star faded as she aged. Now, at age 50, she's pulling a Jane Fonda and doing workout videos while hanging on by a thread. After a serious car accident, a nurse surreptitiously gives her a thumb drive with the words ""The Substance"" on it and a phone number on the back.

If you've seen Coralie Fargeat's <i>Revenge</i>, you know how she works within genre conventions. The internet has completely butchered the concept of the ""male gaze,"" but Fargeat is a director who knows how to speak in it to subvert it.

Despite my issues regarding gender identity, I've never been a woman, let alone one in the entertainment industry. But one arena I'm intimately familiar with and can speak to is self-hatred. And that's where this movie hits for me. I'm too sleepy to expand on that, so take my word for it, please.

I'm angry at the movie for using Bernard Hermann's The Nightmare and Dawn from <i>Vertigo</i> in the score, but at the same time, it worked on me.

I'm just happy to live in a world where a film so visceral and bizarre is getting enough critical attention that people in my family will know about it. Also, I never thought I would see Demi Moore in something like this.

The film begins with the funeral of Cheryl Dempsey, a murder victim of serial killer Edward Carver. We then step back to when police officers raided Carver's home, finding over 800 tapes Carver made of the murders and mutilations of his victims. A substantial subset of the recordings are about Cheryl.

An FBI agent teaches a class about the killer, warning the students about the graphic nature of the tapes. Then, we spend a lot of the movie watching these tapes.

The strange contrast of the movie acting like a true crime documentary while showing such graphic footage from the tapes is the first sign that these filmmakers don't know what they're doing.

From there, we get interviews with actors who can barely keep a straight face, reenactment footage fit for Unsolved Mysteries, and more of these warped tapes (warped in the digital effects they used to make the movie look like VHS footage). We switch between experts claiming this killer is a mastermind while watching the killer performing commedia dell'arte-inspired murders.

The film is not a disaster — it has uneasy and horrifying moments. Also, it remains a cult favorite for a reason.

I'd be curious to see the intersection of true crime fans and fans of this movie.","roku channel, oh my horror, omh, omh2025, found footage",2025-01-13

Badass biker Ako gives Mei a ride to where Mei's gang hangs out, the Stray Cats. The Stray Cats face off against another gang in a knife fight. Little do the Stray Cats know, Ako is watching the battle from afar.

The tide turns when the rival gang calls in their boyfriends for help. Ako rides in to help Stray Cats, and they escape with their lives — at least some of them. When Miki shows up bruised and beaten to report that they've captured Yuka, the Stray Cats want to give up. But Ako rallies the gang into action.

Aikko Wada, who plays Ako, also did the theme song for the movie. I can't tell if I want her or want to be her, but she's cool as hell. Still, the predominantly male audience for this movie favored the more feminine-presenting Mei, played by Meiko Kaji. Mei is the lead in the rest of the <i>Stray Cat Rock</i> series. And to be fair, Meiko Kaji brings far more energy to her scenes.

The counterculture movement soaks the film's structure and ambiance. The camera is frenetic, and everyone is so stylish. Ako is riding her bike through the city at night, and the vibes are off the charts.

The film loses the most steam when it spends time with the boy gangs and their minutia. Even the camera sits still while they talk, almost as if it is as bored as I am.

In case the title is ambiguous, this film is about a group of teenage girls throwing a slumber party, only for a masked killer to crash it.

The previous <i>Slumber Party Massacre</i> movies benefited from their knowledge of and subversion of genre troupes. The first involved the victims in more active roles in their survival, and the second introduced a killer so over-the-top that we could laugh at his antics.

This film rests on the previous films's laurels, not developing the themes beyond ""All men are trash."" Which, yeah, but this doesn't add much that the other films didn't cover.

Also, the movie doesn't have characters. We have a pile of women the film introduces us to — killer fodder, essentially — but we don't get to know any of them.

Ken and Juliette meet on the beach, and the camera pulls out and recreates The Creation of Adam, where Juliette is God and Ken is the reposed Adam. I'm unsure what the movie says with this scene, but it's an unusual choice.

Hanif brings his wife, Nadya, and their three kids to visit Hanif's former caretaker from the orphanage where he grew up. On the road, Hanif hits something with his car. He thinks it's a deer but doesn't see the girl he hit lying in a trench.

At the orphanage, Hanif meets up with his childhood friends and the current caretakers. The orphanage is empty except for two older children, Hasbi and Rani. The other kids are on a field trip. Hanif's youngest, Haqi, finds a locked door. Rani explains that the door hasn't been opened in 20 years and that behind it is the body of Ms. Mirah, a former caretaker who practiced black magic.

When emptying the car, Hanif finds blood and a bit of human hair where he thought he hit the deer. He and his friends go where the accident happened and find the girl. They also discover the bus of children on a field trip. All the kids are dead, too.

What's going on? Is this the revenge of Ms. Mirah? Whatever it is, Hanif and his friends know more than they're letting on.

Similar to <i>A Thousand Days</i>, another film from director Kimo Stamboel, this movie has a slow build and lore that teaches you as it goes. But once the movie gets going, it keeps up the energy and offers some fucked up moments.

The film has some killer set pieces. There's a scene with a stapler that will probably stay with me.

The closing credits show screenshots from the original movie, which this is based on. I'd love to see it if only to see how they do the bug effects. In this movie, they're all CGI, which is a bummer. However, I don't want to see folks eating actual bugs.

My biggest complaint is the plotting and how everything fits together, especially in the third act. It's nothing egregious, but so much happens off-screen that it's hard to understand how people are where they are.

<blockquote><i>Night. Nights without sleep. Long nights in which the brain lights up like a big city.</i></blockquote>Cue ""Soon"" by My Bloody Valentine.

Nadja is that classic young Manhattanite — living off Dad's old money and not doing anything specifically for work. She meets a cute boy at the bar, tells him her story, and takes him home. While they're having sex, she bites his neck and drinks his blood.

Mid-feast, Nadja receives a vision of her father being murdered — a stake through the heart. Nadja takes her slave, Renfield, to the morgue to pick up the body of her father, Count Dracula. Nadja hopes that, no longer in her father's shadow, she will have more freedom to live a new life.

Lucy runs to the boxing ring to tell her husband, Jim, that his uncle is in jail for murder. Jim bails out his uncle, Van Helsing, and takes him out for a bite. His uncle tells Jim that they need to cut off Dracula's head, or he will return. Meanwhile, Lucy meets Nadja at a bar, and the two hit it off.

Cue ""Roads"" by Portishead.

Historically, stories surrounding Dracula's daughter have dealt with identity. She is often coded as a closeted lesbian. This film also explores identity, and how love can drive us to change ourselves, hopefully for the better. But what about us can we change, and what is inherent to our nature?

By far the star of the movie is the amazing soundtrack. The Verve's ""One Way to Go"" plays a recurring role. Also, more Portishead, because Portishead fucking rules.

This film will likely alienate many traditional horror fans. The horror elements are more background fodder, and even the story takes a backseat to the aesthetics. Nadja's world fractures and blurs when she feels love—an effect achieved with a Fisher-Price PixelVision camcorder.

Now, apply that same problem to a 3.5-hour movie. We have an intermission, after which the film makes some choices, most dull, others bizarre. The epilogue, in particular, feels like it's trying to sum up everything the film failed to say up to that point, but in such a goofy way.

I'm not a big fan of biopics. And this isn't one! This guy isn't real. And yet, the movie feels beholden to some hidden timeline.

Who is decapitating all these people in Sleepy Hollow? It sounds like a job for Sherlock… excuse me, police constable Ichabod Crane. New York City has had enough of his science mumbo jumbo. So, Crane can fuck off to the Dutch hamlet, and he can't come back until he's found the killer. That will be hard since all the locals believe the murderer is a legendary Headless Horseman.

While this story diverges from the original Legend of Sleepy Hollow, it still maintains practically all the characters, including Katrina Van Tassel for Crane to fall in love with and Brom Bones to beat Crane up for falling in love with Brom's Katrina.

As a result, it's hard to tell whether we're supposed to root for Crane. In the original story, he's a meddling Yankee who gets what is coming to him. Here, even Depp's performance highlights the incongruities — he waffles between nebbishness and Basil Rathbone-esque stoniness.

The film's inarguable success is its visual choices. The bleach bypass has a washed-out, Gothic look. The reliance on practical effects grounds the action and pulls us into the story. The use of sets further emphasizes the Hammer influence, giving the film a controlled consistency.

Did Mia Goth base her aesthetic on Christina Ricci in this movie?

In <i>Hard Ticket to Hawaii</i>, we met the heroes of this series, Agency operatives Donna and Tayrn. With the help of handsome idiot Rowdy Abilene and his assistant, Jade, they took out drug lord Seth Romero and saved Hawaii.

In Paris, Alejandro Felipe Salazar, a businessman with a complicated backstory, receives a message from crime lord Miguel Ortiz. The Agency has killed Miguel's brother, Luca. Miguel hires Salazar to help him take out those responsible.

Salazar attends an art exhibition at, like, a mall or something and introduces a shitty fish painting called The Picasso Trigger. That also happens to be Salazar's double-agent code name. He and fellow double-agent Pantera exchange pleasantries, believing their secret is safe. But as Salazar leaves the gallery, he is assassinated.

In Vegas, Ortiz's henchmen take out Agency operatives left and right. Next stop? Maui.

In Maui, Donna takes a shower while Tayrn changes out of her revealing nightie into swimwear. They leave the boat to snorkel and pick up some samples for Jade. Good thing because Ortiz and his henchmen blow up their boat with a toy airplane.

The Agency calls the Malibu Express in Hawaii, where newcomer Travis Abilene enjoys the family boat. They inform Travis about Picasso Trigger and other assassinations and tell him to come to Dallas, where Pantera will join him.

Halfway into the movie, Donna and Tayrn fly to Vegas in their Molokai Cargo biplane to assist.

So far, this movie is the weakest in the Triple B series. It involves too much traveling, dull conversations, and little action (at least until the third act).

One day, Diane returns home with groceries and gets a call, leaving the grocery bags behind.

In Chloe's cup of pills is one of the green pills. She confronts her mom about it, but her mom assures Chloe she is mistaken.

Chloe thinks her mom might be lying, but she's unsure why. A seed planted, she researches further. But, with no internet or cell phone access, that may be more difficult than she thinks.

This movie blew up on TikTok, where clips played that revealed key plot points. I think it's clear where the movie is heading, but I'll avoid spoilers regardless.

Actress Kiera Allen, who plays Chloe, is pretty great in this. She subtly mirrors Sarah Paulson's behaviors, making it feel like this is the person she spends all her time around. Also, she's a wheelchair user IRL, so she pulls off some sharp blocking and makes the movie feel all the more grounded.

The first act is where this movie excels. We know the beats it intends to take, and the movie deftly steps through them.

Gemma is a primary school teacher. After class, one student finds an altricial chick ejected from its nest, dead on the ground. Gemma suggests a cuckoo may have done it.

 — Because that's nature. That's the way things are.

Gemma and Tom try to leave the development, but all roads lead to number 9. As if that weren't enough, a baby arrives on their doorstep.

Some cuckoo species engage in a behavioral pattern known as brood parasitism, where the cuckoo manipulates a host into raising the cuckoo's young on its behalf. They do so by laying their eggs in the nests of other species. Martins, for example, are common host targets.

A mechanism comes alive. The sun rises over the town of Hamelin, and the gears grind. A bell awakens the townspeople, who go to work. Their various interactions show how petty and greedy they are. 

In their wanton food waste, the rich draw rats that overtake the town, stealing food and riches. The townspeople are at a loss. That is, until a piper arrives, who claims he can drive away the rats with his pipe.

The film has an exaggerated geometry, reminiscent of German Expressionism, but with a flatness more akin to cubism. The stop-motion animation is complex and elegant, feeling impossible in the contradictions of flat surfaces and depth of action.

The characters speak a fictitious language, so visual cues accompany some of the dialogue to convey what is said.

The world has the darkness of a Grimm fairy tale. The story is violent and ruthless.
This film is a remarkable achievement in animation. I wish I connected to it on an emotional level, but I still adore it.","tubi, oh my horror, omh, omh2025, edited by women",2025-01-19

A stilted voice calls, asking for Jo Ann. Jo Ann initiates phone sex, reading a script about about bus exchange. She stops briefly to swat a fly. The stilted voice takes heavy drags off his cigarette. Laying around him are open BDSM porno mags. He grabs a knife off the table and runs it along his nipples. ""Nobody can handle nipples like Bobo,"" he says before hanging up. 

That night, Jo Ann goes on a run with her dog Asberry. She finds her dog held by a man wearing a clown mask. He performs a routine with a baseball bat, and Jo Ann laughs and goes along with it. She tries to leave, but he won't let her leave. Before she knows it, he swings the bat down onto her head.

The police are convinced that the killer is Kevin, a photographer who regularly shoots the girls. So, Kevin and his girlfriend, Kristi, decide they need to find the killer themselves.

The Brian De Palma influence leaps out. Cameron Dye has diet Craig Wasson energy.

While ostensibly a slasher, the film puts far more emphasis on eroticism than the kills.  Not that it isn't violent—it just leans closer to thriller than outright slasher.

The movie is also funnier than the material suggests — not a laugh riot or anything, but the women who work for the sex line have some jokes.

The filmmaking is a little clumsy. The cinematography is solid, although it has some hammy stylistic choices. The pacing drags, even when things are supposed to be exciting.

Still, this movie is quite well done, even if it doesn't do anything too remarkable.","tubi, birth year challenge, slasher",2025-01-19

As Blake grew up, he became Charlotte's husband and a father to Ginger. Blake has an anger problem, but he's aware of it and is trying to work through it. Still, it is causing a strain on his marriage.

One day, he receives a letter that his father, who went missing years ago, has been pronounced dead. So, to try to mend the family back together, Blake takes them to his childhood home in Oregon to gather his father's things. What they discover will forever change their family.

Leigh Whannell directed <i>The Invisible Man</i> in 2020. It is a tremendous and promising horror flick. The film utilizes slick cinematography and effects to convey perspective and presence, bringing the Invisible Man to life for a contemporary audience.

Here, it's clear that Whannell does not have the same affinity for the Wolf Man character. We get top-notch set pieces and special effects, but they fit awkwardly between a slow, poorly lit story. The metaphor of the Wolf Man and anger is obvious, but the film isn't sure you're smart enough to pick up on it, so it goes to enormous lengths to explain what we're supposed to think.

Christopher Abbott is solid, although once he starts transforming, the film doesn't give him much to do except pop that top. Which, of course, he does.

Julia Garner is absurdly flat in this. I've never seen her where I didn't think she at least brought something to the table. Here, she is the weakest link by a mile. She picks up near the end when things heat up, but I could not believe she ever loved or had a kid with Christopher Abbott.

I saw this movie with someone who had a great time. She wanted a creature feature, and she got a creature feature. While I share some of her enthusiasm for some of the filmmaking, the product, on the whole, left me feeling like I got the cheapest rendition of this story they could conceive of.

It's India Stoker's 18th birthday. Her father, Richard, has died in a car accident. Her mother, Evelyn, is broken by the experience. After the funeral, India and Evelyn host the funeral reception with the help of Mrs. McGarrick, the head caretaker.

At the reception, India meets her father's younger brother, Charlie, whom she didn't know existed. His presence annoys India and distresses Mrs. McGarrick. Charlie tells India he will stay with the family to support India and Evelyn.

India witnesses an altercation between Charlie and Mrs. McGarrick, who insinuates she has been passing info about the family to Charlie for years. Soon, Mrs. MicGarrick disappears, and Evelyn and Charlie spend all their time together. India wonders if there is a plot underfoot. If so, to what end?

Park Chan-wook's first English-language film has a swirling Gothic energy, not unlike Shirley Jackson's We Have Always Lived in the Castle. The filmmaking perfectly complements India's adolescence—everything is heightened with a sense of longing and distrust that feels teenage, at least how I remember it.

The high school scenes initially feel weird and tonally inconsistent with the rest of the movie. But they're the gateway to a side of India we can't know otherwise.

Speaking of what the director is known for, his use of juxtaposition is so clever and does some powerful storytelling. It's the kind of stuff that makes me exclaim, ""Cinema!"" like a dork.

We get a recap of Dr. Phibes's deal (dead wife, revenge, etc). He joins his wife, Victoria, in suspended animation until the Moon enters alignment with the planets.

Three years later, Dr. Phibes arises and gives a glorious speech detailing his plans to take Victoria to the River of Life in Egypt, where they both will receive eternal life. Phibes summons his assistant, Vulnavia, to retrieve the ancient map, only to discover that his home has been destroyed and his safe emptied.

The culprit is a mysterious and wealthy man named Darius Biederbeck. He has his intentions for the map and its destination. Phibes may be able to retrieve the map, but that won't stop Biederbeck from pursuing him.

This film has much of the theatrics from <i>The Abominable Dr. Phibes</i>. The kills are over-the-top, at least in their setup. Often, the final kill is underwhelming compared to the elaborate setup.

The humor is more pronounced, leaning into the silliness of the whole setup. The detectives hunting down Phibes engage in all sorts of wordplay and misunderstandings.

This movie was around when Vincent Price started poisoning his well by asking for more money and disavowing himself from AIP, leading to him getting fewer acting roles. His career never stopped until his final role in Edward Scissorhands, but the quality of the films he acted in was spottier.

Julia and Francis moved to Bucharest. Francis's mother is from Romania, so he speaks Romanian, but Julia is still learning. Francis works long hours, and Julia is reevaluating her life after a stint as an actress, so Julia practices her Romanian and explores the city. From their large apartment windows, Julia notices a man who always seems to look out at her when she is at the window.

Julia and Francis pass by an accident, but no one knows what happened. On the news the following day, she sees a news report about a woman murdered in her apartment—she realizes it's the scene they passed. At a dinner with Francis's colleagues, she learns that the woman was decapitated and that this is the most recent in a series of similar murders in the area.

The film follows Julia as she navigates her new life, her anxieties around the serial killer, and the unnerving suspicion that someone is following her.

Julia's neighbor, Irina, befriends her. Irina is dealing with an ex who won't leave her alone. But Irina carries a gun, so she knows if her ex tries to cross a line, she has a defense.

<blockquote><i>— Do I sound paranoid?
— Let's hope you never find out. The best outcome may be that you live with the uncertainty.</i></blockquote>

This film plays brilliantly with perspective, regularly putting us in Julia's shallow depth of field. She sees the face of the man following her, but we only catch glimpses of him. As we piece the glimpses together, they don't always add up to a coherent person.

So many movies try to pull off the tone this movie achieves, and it does it so effortlessly that it's hard to pinpoint how this one succeeds where others fail. Perhaps it's in Chloe Okuno's directing or her screenplay rewrite. Maybe it's Maika Monroe's performance.

The Fukishimas have just moved into a small Tokyo apartment. Keiko introduces herself and Akira to the landlord. When Keiko says it's only the two of them, Akira looks at the camera. The two gingerly carry their suitcases, letting the movers handle the others. Once everything settles, they open the suitcases to reveal Shigeru and Yuki, Keiko's two youngest children. The fifth child, Kyoko, takes a night train to the apartment.

Keiko has a new boyfriend who promises to marry her. She believes if he follows through, everyone can live together, and all the kids can attend school. Of course, this is not the first time she's made that promise to Akira, her eldest son. Each kid comes from a different father, and none are in the picture.

One morning, Akira wakes up to find a letter from his mother saying she will be gone for a while and to look after Kyoko, Shigeru, and Yuki. With an envelope full of Yen, Akira must figure out how to pay the bills and care for his siblings until she returns.

The promise of love is a terrible beast. You try over and over, hoping this one will be the one who stays around, but something goes wrong—you fuck it up, they fuck it up—and you're alone again. To try again, some folks would call that resilience. Others would call it stupidity.

When kids are in the picture, people might call you selfish. My mom was someone I considered selfish. She would start relationships with volatile men, bringing them into our home. ""Am I not allowed to be happy?"" she would say when we'd ask her why she kept trying. Last I heard, she married again.

The textures of everyday life fill every scene — each moment feels indescribably human, from the children's piano on the shelf to the new grocer having trouble opening the bag.

As the film covers a year, filming took place over a year, with everything filmed chronologically, so the passage of time is authentic. It helps that Kore-eda used discreet cameras to capture several of the children's performances. He also didn't give them ""roles,"" encouraging the kids to be themselves and let character derive from that. The resulting performances are remarkable.

My heart hurts so much from watching this — I started crying around 20 minutes in, and it didn't let up. Unlike <i>Shoplifters</i>, which explored similar themes, this film does not dissolve into melodrama. The result is tragic and unbelievably beautiful.

Bol and Rial flee South Sudan with Nyagak, only to lose her on the boat ride from France to England. In England, a committee summons Bol and Rial to grant them probational asylum in London, with strict restrictions—weekly check-ins, a £74 allowance that they may not supplement with work, and a house of the government's choosing that they may not move from. They must follow these rules, or the government will deport them.

The government assigns them to a rundown house full of trash and broken appliances, telling them they are lucky for getting a place all to themselves. Their case worker, Mark, encourages them to assimilate and be ""one of the good ones."" Bol takes this to heart and does his best to assimilate, but Rial does not want to abandon their roots.

At night, Bol hears Nyagak's voice in the walls. The sound of tenement neighbors accosting them collides with the screams and cries they heard in South Sudan. But the experiences grow stranger, as though nightmares bleed into reality. What evil lives in their walls? What can they do to appease it?

How much grief is enough to move on? Can you decide that for yourself? Or must you be subject to the body's mourning process, day after day, when all you want is a moment where it doesn't hurt so much? You can change your life and try to start anew. You can hold the cherished memories at arm's length. But grief will end when it will end.

The film explores the refugee experience of belonging nowhere and the eternal debt asylum countries put on refugees. The specter in their house is a mirror—the impossible promise of safety in return for an unknowable price all encased in the incomprehensible trauma they faced and the guilt of surviving when others did not.

It's a shame they couldn't get a cinematographer or lighting team experienced with filming black skin. Wunmi Mosaku and Sope Dirisu disappear in the already too-dark scenes. I've seen worse, but it's disappointing all the same.

In a deluge of horror films exploring grief, this film finds an underexplored avenue through our refugee characters and their cultural background. The arcs are familiar, but the textures are fresh.

Distraught, Laura drives home and takes her own life.

Six months pass. Richard wants to take the kids to their lodge up north for Christmas. Richard would drop them off to spend time with Grace while he worked, then return to spend Christmas with them. Aiden is horrified, knowing that Grace is the subject of one of Richard's books, and believes Laura's suicide is Grace's fault.

That night, Aiden and Mia sneak into Richard's office to read what they can about Grace. Grace is the only surviving member of a mass suicide led by a Christian cult and the daughter of the cult leader. They also found a video Grace made of all the deceased cult members when she was 12 years old.

Still, the trip continues. The children are hostile towards Grace. But how will Grace handle all of this?

Like the directors' previous film, <i>Goodnight Mommy</i>, the movie plays with our expectations around family dynamics and perspective on what is happening. This extends to Thimios Bakatakis's cinematography, which uses genre conventions to suggest the type of movie you're watching.

Casting Riley Keough and Alicia Silverstone was a brilliant choice. The two bear more than a passing resemblance, adding further to the general distress.

Riley Keough is excellent in this. Her character's progression holds the entire movie together, and she nails it. From the children's disdain to Richard's infantilization, she is a character we only meet after everyone's assumptions are in place. It's up to the audience to find our way to who Grace is.

It's 1958, and 10-year-old Michael is having a hard time. His family just moved to a new state. He's awkward, has a demented sense of humor, and has terrible nightmares. While his mom is loving and supportive, his dad isn't helping with his odd pep talks about darkness and adulthood. When Michael jumps into bed at night, he imagines the sheets sinking into an endless pool of blood.

Michael meets fellow newbie Shiela at his new school, who claims to be from the moon. Things are looking up until he catches his parents engaging in a bizarre ritual where their clothes are off, and their mouths are all over each other's bodies. Additionally, they've been eating leftovers every day since they moved, and Michael isn't sure where the meat comes from.

Bob Balaban brings a Lynchian lens to childhood, where the membrane between nightmare and reality is thin, and everything is weird and terrifying. You don't know how the world is supposed to be. And when you ask hard questions, parents and adults aren't interested in giving you straight answers.

The filmmaking beautifully serves this surrealism. The cinematography does so much storytelling and tone-setting, giving even the most mundane moments an aura of menace. Angelo Badalamenti's score is raspy and dark, with more texture than music, adding to the discomfort of each moment.

Randy Quaid is so good as the father. His eyes hold a steely coldness. His slow movement feels like a killer stalking his prey.

This movie might make me a vegetarian. I mean, probably not, but at least for the rest of the night.

 Similar to the idea of the benevolent benefactor, it takes the systemic problems out of the equation and positions us to pray for the benevolent teacher who has all the time, jokes, and smarts to save the day and the kids.

Trish and her brother, Darry, drive through the North Florida countryside in Trish's 1960 Chevy Impala. Darry drives recklessly, stressing out Trish. An old truck one-ups him, tailgating as though trying to drive them off the road, but eventually passes. The experience reminds them of an urban legend about a couple who disappeared on prom night.

Later, they pass by the same old truck parked outside a church. From a distance, it looks like the driver is dumping bodies wrapped in blood-soaked sheets down a pipe. Trish grabs Darry's cell phone, but it's dead. The truck driver careens onto the road to chase them down. It slammed repeatedly into the back of the Impala, stressing me out because the car was in such good condition.

Any sane human would check the car, wait a while for the truck to get some miles ahead, and continue. They could reach a payphone and call the police to investigate. But Darry is a horror movie character, so he convinces Trish to return to the church and see what the truck driver dumped.

<blockquote><i>You know the part in scary movies where somebody does something really stupid, and everybody hates them for it? This is it.</i></blockquote>

Trish and Darry's antagonistic but loving sibling relationship is a clever start to the movie. By the time the action starts, we have solid characterization and expectations around their responses, no matter how ridiculous they may feel.

The first act has top-notch pacing. It's one of the best starts to a horror movie I've seen from this era. The fakeout scares are not throwaway cliches but slow burns that give the audience enough time to get caught up in the fear.

Is this the movie that made Justin Long a scream queen? Because he's great in this! Darry is annoying, but believably so. He gets to be the ""hysterical"" one that no one believes.

The movie pivots hard after a point. I'll discuss this further in the spoiler section below. It doesn't get terrible, but it's such a departure from what I liked that it's disappointing.

Due to budget cuts, the writer rewrote the third act during production. So, instead of whatever the original plan was, we have a psychic black woman show up to explain away the monster. Then, we have an epic battle with the creature, which happens entirely over police radios. When we see it, it looks like a Buffy monster of the week.

You're telling me this monster that has been hiding for decades, feeding in the dark, suddenly makes itself known to police forces in multiple counties because it wants to eat Justin Long's eyes?","amazon prime, hooptober, hoop-tober",2025-01-24

A frazzled Jess rushes around to get ready to meet Greg at the harbor. She tries to take her son, Tommy, with her, but he is resistant. We meet Greg and the gang on the boat. Jess arrives just after Victor, looking distant but amicable. Jess goes inside the ship and naps. Victor tells Greg that Jess doesn't seem to remember where her son Tommy is.

The trip goes smoothly until the wind suddenly stops. In the distance, a patch of black clouds approaches, almost like watercolor paint bleeding into the painting. Greg checks with the Coast Guard about the sudden change in weather, only for a distress signal to come in over the radio. A woman says, ""She's killing everyone. They're dead. They're all dead.""

The storm rages, capsizing the boat. Everyone gets on the overturned boat, and the storm leaves as quickly as it came. Soon, an ocean liner approaches. They board, but no one seems to be aboard. As they explore the boat, Jess gets a sense of déjà vu.

The film follows the gang as they explore this strange, vacant ship and a mysterious presence that follows them.

The dialogue is pretty weak, but it gets the job done. By the time we're at the end, it approaches eye-rolling in how mechanical it is. The film also makes a blatant visual reference to another movie that, if you've seen it, will tell you what is happening in this movie.

That said, the movie has fun with visual cues and effects. We spend most of the runtime paying attention to details to see how everything will come together.

I don't know why all these Aussie and Kiwi actors are putting on American accents. Most hold it down, but the Aussie accent slips in more than once.

An aside that doesn't affect anything but annoys me is that the film confuses Aeoluses from Greek myth. The ruler of the winds, Aeolus, is not the father of Sisyphus — that one is the eponym of the Aeolians, one of the four major tribes of the Greek people.

Michael watches a video of his best friend, Chris, ranting, shooting guns, and breaking down in a rural area. The video is accompanied by a map with a marker for Chris's location. Michael wants to find Chris and help him, but his wife, Jennifer, thinks it's a terrible idea.

Michael arrives to find Chris ranting and shooting at birds. They sit and talk for a bit. Chris hits his crack pipe. Michael asks Chris to let him take Chris to rehab for a week. Chris refuses, citing that he loves his life as it is. So, Michael subdues Chris with a stun gun, chain cuffs Chris to a pipe, and enforces a cold turkey detox on Chris.

As Michael spends time with Chris, he wanders around the area, finding strange items and meeting a cast of unusual characters. Each item tells a story with a fucked up ending. What do they mean? How does it all tie together?

The film is more comedy than horror for most of its runtime. While Michael is out finding stuff, Chris is going through withdrawal and gives zero fucks about Michael's experience. In that way, the film has a meta quality, where it feels like the detox house is where the characters discuss the movie they're in. It also reflects the characters who don't like their life, looking for something to change it — Chris, through crack, and Michael, through helping Chris.

Humans are storytelling creatures. It's how we make sense of the infinite. From creation myths to that asshole who cut me off on the way to the grocery store, the moment it leaves internal experience and comes out, I transmute it through story. Artists put on themselves the idea that they must tell these stories through their art or capture some essence that transcends the story. But every story has a beginning, middle, and end.

Making a movie about that is fascinating in concept but not always the most interesting to watch. That said, if you can remain open and curious, the movie has some compelling ideas. I wouldn't call it a horror movie, though.

And that's a wrap on Hooptobers! I missed 11 last year, but looking at the criteria made me want to claw my eyes out, so I probably won't be doing them anymore.

<blockquote><i>In nature's scheme of things, there are certain plants which are carnivorous or eating plants. […] There is much still to learn about these fascinating eating plants. […] [A] newcomer, trifidus selectus, [was] brought to earth on the meteorites during <b>The Day of the Triffids</b>.</i></blockquote>

An unprecedented shower of meteorites rains down across the globe. Most burn up from the intense heat before they reach the earth. Bill Masen listens to the radio discuss the phenomenon while lying in a hospital bed, his eyes bandaged, frustrated by his inability to see what's happening. He begs Dr. Soames and his nurse, Miss Jamieson, to remove the bandages, but they deny his request, reminding him they can come off in the morning.

A security guard for a greenhouse makes his rounds while all this is happening. He passes a set of plants that seem to dance in the flashlight's glow. When he turns to face them head-on, they remain still. After he passes, the plants grow at an otherworldly rate. He sits for a tea break. He hears movement but doesn't see anything. The plants unroot themselves, creeping through the greenhouse. By the time the guard notices what is happening, it's too late — the plant slashes his face and pulls him into its body, consuming him. The triffids have arrived.

Bill awakes at nine, desperate to finally get his bandages removed. He calls for Miss Jamieson and Dr. Soames, but no one replies. He stumbles around the hospital room. A scream erupts from down the hall. Bill removes his bandages himself, letting his eyes adjust. He finds the hospital in total disarray a la <i>28 Days Later</i>. A stumbling Dr. Soames runs into Bill, who takes Dr. Soames to his office. The glare of the meteorites the previous night has blinded him and most of the world. Bill is one of the few people left on earth with sight.

How will the world handle this crisis? What can they do to stop the triffids?

The film explores the different mentalities of how to approach a crisis like this. Those with privilege can hide away and wait it out, even if it's only a prolonged wait until death. Bill has the privilege of seeing when few others cannot, so he sees it as his responsibility to help however he can.

The film does a great job of establishing chaos in London. Bill isn't safe in the city as desperate people roam around, fighting each other for a chance to speak to a sighted person. Out in the country fog, the triffids grow and stalk their prey. Regardless, Bill isn't looking for safety—he's looking for answers.

The triffid design is fun. Several folks find them hokey, but I haven't seen monstrous plant designs like this one.

I haven't read the book or seen the canonical 1980s adaptation, so I can't speak to what this movie did right or wrong there. The comparison I made to <i>28 Days Later</i> earlier applies throughout the film — they share several similar story beats.

I can't say this is the most exciting story, but I enjoyed myself.","tubi, oh my horror, omh2025, omh, post-apocalypse, nature attacks",2025-01-26

Eddie Cusack walks alongside a trash truck, emptying bins. He looks around. The track truck driver, Dorato, looks around. A guy on the balcony looks around. Folks, we have a sting operation on our hands.

Doc picks up Spider, and the two head to the sting site. Cash changes hands and bundles of coke come out. But who are these bozos in the paint truck? The painters enter the building across from where the coke deal is going down. They assemble semi-automatic weapons and line the windows.

One of the cops notifies Cusack about the painters. Cusack catches on and rushes the building. But he's too late. The painters open fire, taking out several drug dealers. Cusack and the gang give chase to the painters. Craigie, an older cop, accidentally kills an unarmed bystander. Panicked, he plants a gun on the kid. Cusack walks in on the scene, and Craigie forces his partner, Kopalas, to agree that the kid had a gun.

But Cusack knows Craigie, and this ain't Craigie's first mistake. Will Cusack join his fellow officers and uphold the code of silence? Can he handle the police politics and get to the bottom of the drug kingpin rivalry, especially when nobody squeals?

The film explores violence and the myriad ways we misuse it. The police err on the side of violence, putting innocent people in danger. Here they're also investing in robot cops—more guns without brains. The Luna crime family, who sent the painters to the drug hit, has a leader who is trying to start a gang war without thinking through the consequences to those he loves. The Commachos, the ones dealing the Columbian Coke, know they don't have the resources for this gang war but are driven by a thirst for revenge.

Chuck Norris has always been a weak actor who makes up for it with his stunts and fighting capability. This movie asks more of him than he can manage, but his stoicism is sufficient to get him through. Chuck Norris helps all the set pieces, some of which require some physical prowess that he can handle. No stunt double makes for more consistent tension.

The pacing is satisfying, giving us plenty of plot to experience without rushing through all the details. We spend time with characters from all facets of the story, so we watch the pinpoints slowly converge.

On paper, this looks like yet another cheeseball Chuck Norris flick. But this film has an emotional core that helps this movie stand out from your typical cop thriller fare.","tubi, cmc, cmc2024",2025-01-26

<b>Before Travis Bickle or Archie Bunker, there was Joe Curran.</b>

Melissa Compton lives with her boyfriend, Frank. Frank is short on cash, and their heroin supply is running low. But Frank's got a deal in the works that should put them in a better place. Melissa begs him not to. He gives her a pill to chill her out. Instead, it puts her in a delirious frenzy that lands her in the hospital.

Melissa's parents, Bill and Joan, come to fetch her. Bill proposes rehab, then goes to Melissa and Frank's apartment to pick up her belongings. Frank comes home to find Bill there. Frank makes some snide remarks about Melissa, sending Bill into a rage. Bill ends up beating Frank to death. He takes some drugs to make it look like a robbery, then hits a bar nearby.

At the bar, Joe Curran is on a tirade about black people and hippies. Bill comes in and tries to settle himself. Joe talks about wishing he could kill a hippy. Bill, for some reason, blurts out that he just did. When Joe realizes Bill isn't joking, the two begin a strange bond that will change Bill's life.

<blockquote><i>Do you ever get the feeling that your life, and everything you do, is a crock of shit?</i></blockquote>Peter Boyle's Joe is the prototype for similar characters in the 1970s, including Archie Bunker. Like <i>All in the Family</i>, the intent is a dark irony about a conservative losing his head over the state of the world. But, more importantly, it's also about how similar-minded the liberal and conservative are—the conservative is just more honest about it.

Here, Joe loosens up Bill and gets him to realize aspects of himself he hadn't come to grips with. After all, a level-headed guy doesn't murder his daughter's boyfriend, regardless of the circumstances. Joe blames minorities for all of his woes, which is why he adores Bill so much. Bill is aspirational, not just in spirit (Joe wants to kill hippies, but Bill does it), but in wealth, since Bill is a wealthy executive.

That solidarity has a lot of political power. We're seeing it unfold in real-time in the USA.

The film takes its time developing the story, letting each moment linger and expanding on the emotional quality of the environment. In some ways, this helps the story feel true in its world, but when you look at each piece separately, it feels contrived. The film doesn't explore what it suggests with as much depth as I would have liked.

Boyle's performance makes this movie worth watching. I find the comedy hard to enjoy, but I can appreciate the intent.","tubi, cmc, cmc2024",2025-01-27

A lost man named Wayne wanders up to Cyril, tinkering with his motorbike. Wayne has the name of a house but no street or directions—just that it's somewhere near King's Cross. Cyril takes Wayne up to his flat, which he shares with his partner, Shirley, to see if she knows where the place might be. Shirley makes Wayne some tea while they sort it out. She introduces Wayne to her cactuses, named Bollock, Dick, Turd, Brains, and so on. Out of ideas, they send Wayne to find a cabbie.

Cyril and Shirley hop on his motorbike to visit Cyril's old lady. She's pushing 70 and done with it. Cyril tries to wind her up, but she's having none of it. He laments how the neighborhood has changed since his youth, with the middle class taking over. The couple is socially conscious and aware of how the lower classes stab themselves in the foot by voting Tory. The conversation carries on all the way home and into the night, eventually leading them to a talk of kids, the one area where the two seem at odds.

Then, Wayne shows up, still lost. Wayne's a bit thick, but his heart is in the right place. So, the two offer him a place to stay for the night. The film follows Cyril and Shirley interacting with people from different social classes and backgrounds.

The film explores the culture clash because of social differences. Initially, the movie takes a comedic approach, but as the movie carries on, the ramifications of these social differences create dramatic tension. Cyril's mum has difficulty living alone, finding herself in predicaments where she isn't sure where she's left things. Her community has moved away or died, so asking for help is no easy task.

Ruth Sheen has British Shelley Duvall energy. Her performance is the standout of the movie. She and Cyril have a desirable relationship—two people who care about people and each other, accepting folks where they are and unafraid to offer help where they can. They have their hangups — Cyril's a Marxist without an aim and righteous anger against the folks who meet, discussing the revolution but not doing anything about it.

Why the hell does Criterion have Americans writing closed captions for British films? There are so many [inaudible]s throughout and for every accent.

This film is the first Mike Leigh I've seen that resonated with me. Granted, I haven't seen many, but it makes me optimistic to watch more in the future.","criterion channel, birth year challenge, solidarity, british social realism",2025-01-27

Folks gather at the Kao Villa to celebrate Lord Kao Pang's marriage. Suddenly, a stealth of ninjas forms at the entranceway. Following behind is Pak Chung Tong, a sworn enemy of Kao Pang's father. Though uninvited, Pak unveils a present for the young Lord: a pig's head. A fight breaks out. The blood of swordbearers from both sides paints the walls of the villa. Kao Pang fights his way through, but his men knock him unconscious so they can take him to safety.

While Grandmaster Chen Guan Wu tends to Kao Pang's wounds, Kao Pang vows vengeance. Chen Guan Wu won't let him fight in his condition. Instead, the Grandmaster encourages him to hire the Divine Blade, Chang San.

Kao Pang tails Chang San to observe his mettle. They observe Chang San protecting children, caring for his mother, and fighting on behalf of Tsing Yi. But when a traveling swordsman named Pray challenges Chang San, Chang San runs. Kao Pang approaches Pray with an offer, setting off a complicated game of deception, revenge, and honor.

Before John Woo became known in Hong Kong for his heroic bloodshed films, he made this film as a tribute to his mentor, Shaw Brothers director Chang Cheh. Woo's choice to make a wuxia pian in the age of kung-fu films was unfashionable, especially for Golden Harvest, who released the film. But Woo had already made a name for himself as a young director who knew how to transform genre.

Here, we see several of Woo's preferences: a heroic duo, high body counts, and graphic violence. Though present in Cheh's films, Woo also draws from Sam Peckinpah and Akira Kurosawa. Woo lets the camera roll to convey fully the actor's skills.

With so many fight sequences, several have fun set pieces to help them stand out. For example, Tsing Yi is an avid wine drinker, drinking from a pot of wine while taking out a hoard of men. In another fight, Chang San holds a flag to block hits from his opponent, and the flag gets shorter as the fight continues.

Though Woo's hypermasculine (see homoerotic) take on wuxia loses some of what I enjoy about the genre, I still appreciate the inventive craftwork here and had a lot of fun.","criterion channel, cmc, cmc2024, criterion, chopsocky, wuxia",2025-01-28

Boy, this script is a mess. The dialogue has the aching desire to be funny or clever, but it dodges both with graceless fervor. The first act has its charms, with its array of screwball characters, but that isn't the movie. It's a Maguffin-finding adventure with a touch of psychic powers. So, like, every movie that comes out these days.

Lung and Chen stand in Chen's new apartment. Chen wears a baby blue suit and thick sunglasses. She lists appliances that could go on shelves in the bedroom. Lung is in khakis and a polo, smoking a cigarette, and pretending to swing a baseball bat. He worries about the cost of fixing up the place, but Chen's boss, Ms. Mei, has promised Chen a promotion and raise. When Chen moves in, Lung will be in LA.

Cut to some time later, when Lung is coming back from America. The apartment is decorated and full of appliances. Chen's boss, Ms. Mei, quit due to a construction error that led to another company acquiring them. Chen worries that her position may be in jeopardy. Her colleague, Mr. Ke, is also planning on leaving. The two overlook the city. Mr. Ke laments that he cannot distinguish the buildings he designed from all the others, considering it a sign that his work is no longer meaningful.

Lung visits Mr. Lai, his old Little League coach. Mr. Lai asks Lung about LA. Lung says it isn't that different from Taipei. He also spent a week in Tokyo. That night, he goes with Chen to visit her family. Chen announces her move-out. Her father notes how times have changed, a daughter moving out before marriage. Lung leaves to drop off tapes at Mr. Lai's place. When Chen asks about Tokyo, Lung tells her he was only there for a layover.

The film follows Chen and Lung as they look forward and figure out what that means for them.

The Chinese title of the film is 青梅竹馬, or ""green plum, bamboo horse,"" is a Chinese idiom referring to childhood sweethearts. The title suggests a melodramatic love story about lovers meant to be. The film is anything but. With sparse cityscapes and little non-diegetic music, this film is about the world as it is.

The English title, Taipei Story, performs a subtle political move. Edward Yang and Hou Hsiao-Hsien (who stars in this as Lung) remind audiences that Taiwan is outside and independent of mainland China. Not only that, but Taipei was a city embracing the globalization of the 1980s and the Western values that came with it.

Much of the film explores the contrasts between traditional life in Taipei and the life that globalization has brought to the city. It's less about one vs. the other and more of an interrogation of what it means to live in a city going through an identity crisis. As we've seen, industrialization increases the cost of living, and few have the means to live as they did.

That identity crisis spreads to our two characters. Chen has embraced Western values and longs to emigrate to the States with Lung. But Lung is unsure about the emigration and falls into nostalgia for his past and, by extension, the city's. Lung grows distant, leaving Chen at a loss for how to move forward.

One of my favorite little moments is when Chen's sister, Ling, comes by to ask for money. To soften up Chen, she pulls out a wind-up Pepsi-Cola can that walks when let go.

Also, the night photography is so gorgeous. Every Tumblr photographer aspired to this aesthetic in the 2000s.

<blockquote><i>Inflation, shortages, unemployment, crime wave. Government invokes emergency powers</i></blockquote>

The streets are on fire, trash and debris clinging to every gust of wind. Jimmy takes a jog through the red-glowing industrial wasteland of Syndey. He makes it back to the safety of his home. His brother, Frank, gives him a lift down to the takeaway. Frank drives a tow truck—one of many that follows police calls to lay claim to cars. He also has to fight off roving gangs who also try to lay claim to the cars. Jimmy wants to do what Frank does, but everyone tells Jimmy that he's too skinny and too weak to do the work.

Jimmy takes Frank's red 1956 Chevrolet Bel Air Convertable to pick up his girlfriend, Carmen. They go to the local Star Drive-In to do, well, what teens do when they go to the drive-in. While they're fucking, the car drops beneath them—someone has stolen their wheels. Jimmy runs outside to find the police loading the wheels into the back of their truck.

Jimmy goes to the entrance to file a complaint, but the owner says he must camp there for the night. When he wakes up in the morning, he finds that most of the cars from the previous evening are still parked there, some converted into hovels. They go back to the entrance to file a report. The owner gives them meal tickets and tells them they're stuck until the government decides what to do with them.

Aussie punks trapped in a drive-in converted into an internment camp is a fun idea. It's youth trapped in a prison without a future — a metaphor not unlike Mark Fischer's hauntology. Add to it the slow creep of Nazi punks looking to take over, and you have some outright cultural relevance.

There's a moment in the movie where police drop off hundreds of Asian people, and the camp loses it, demanding the police remove them. Carmen is worried that they'll rape her. Jimmy tries to help her understand that Asian people are prisoners, just like them. 

All the pieces are in place for something compelling. But the movie does almost nothing with the setup it's given us. It mentions these ideas without exploring them with any curiosity. Ultimately, the film suggests that collective action is only viable to make things worse and that it takes a Rambo to save himself.

The music rules. The movie looks best at night, full of fire and neon. The Jesus statue with the neon halo is sick. For a few minutes, we even get some killer car stunts. Still, the movie left me wanting more from the ideas it introduced.","cmc, cmc2024, carsploitation, post-apocalypse, scifiploitation, ozploitation",2025-01-29

<b>Guy Fawkes Night, 1892, London</b>

As people run the street with fireworks and sparklers, Oscar Wilde and Lord Alfred Douglas take a horse-drawn carriage to Alfred Taylor's lavish brothel in Westminster. While Douglas (Bosie, as Wilde calls him) heads downstairs to see what mischief he can find, Wilde goes upstairs to find a stage set and a couch made. On the couch is a book containing Aubrey Beardsley's illustrations for the first English edition of Wilde's play, Solome.

When Taylor greets Wilde, they play a guessing game before Taylor reveals that he, the clients, and the courtesans will be staging Wilde's play, Salome. Lord Chamberlain banned the play from public performance, so Taylor wished to gift Wilde the opportunity to see it staged. The curtains pull back, and Bosie is in a cage, tortured by topless guards. The play has begun.

This film falls into a similar vein as <i>Gothic</i>, where it takes real people and sets up a fantasy around one night of their lives. Here, we have Wilde's play performed near verbatim, with the slight framing device as mentioned above.

Ken Russell shot the film for just over $1 million, and its small budget shows. The camera mostly observes the play with little of Russell's usual playfulness. All this is because Russell took a bet that he couldn't make a movie under $1 million.

The play in the movie has long bouts of tedium because we know where it's going. But Oscar Wilde's gotta do his wordplay thing.

The costumes and staging are entertaining. The pinnacle of the movie is the Dance of the Seven Veils, which amusingly plays with gender.

Her captors, two reptile-adjacent puppets, watch in fear. Eiko's chastity belt around her arm goes off. This can only mean one thing: the frog monster is attracted to her. It licks her face, triggering the chastity belt, turning her into a superhero: Star Virgin.

Star Virgin breaks out of her binds, grabs the frog monster's tongue, and ties it around a tree. She draws her sword to kill the beast, but it runs away. Safe from harm, she runs to her ship and flies off the reptile planet to her next adventure.

While on her ship, she slips into a bubble bath and records a captain's log of her first week of vacation. Tired of visiting uncivilized planets, she decides to visit a planet on the cusp of civilization called Earth. Once there, she boards her flying scooter and hits the streets.

<blockquote><i>1954. You don't get years like that anymore. It was my favorite year. […] In 1954, television was live, and comedy was king. Comic stars like Milton Berle, Sid Caesar, and Jackie Gleason kept America in front of their TV sets. I was the freshman writer on The Comedy Cavalcade starring Stan ""King"" Kaiser, Saturday nights at 8:00. </i></blockquote>

Benjy Stone makes his way out of 30 Rockefeller Plaza in NYC carrying a cardboard cutout of his idol, Alan Swann, a swashbuckling adventure star from the 1930s and 1940s. That week, Swann will be the guest star on The Comedy Cavalcade.

When Benjy gets to the writer's room, he finds out Swann has gone missing on a sex and booze-fueled bender. When Swann finally shows up, he's plastered. King and the execs want to dump him, but Benjy begs them to give Swann one more shot. So, King assigns Benjy to babysit Swann every day until showtime.

An episode of <i>30 Rock</i> features Kenneth meeting his idol, Bucky Bright, only to learn of the traumatizing horrors that Bright engaged in during the early days of television. I'm pretty sure this movie inspired that episode. In fact, the sets, illogical plot developments, and permanent manic energy remind me so much of <i>30 Rock</i> that this movie has to influence the show.

Cameron Mitchell shows up as Karl, a Jack Donaghy-type boss, gruff-voiced and suited expensively, with whom King has a long-standing grudge over a recurring skit impersonating Karl.

I love that Herb is too shy to say his jokes out loud, so he whispers them to Alice.

The worst scenes are Benjy ""romancing"" K.C. Mark Linn-Baker is charmless, despite the movie's best efforts. Jessica Harper is underutilized and relegated to the humorless love interest. You could cut these scenes and affect nothing else in the film.

Fire and electricity crackle. Water fills the halls. A mass emerges from beneath—a body, long dead. Hands pull at chains that bind them to the water sprinkler system. A face appears in the reflection of the water—the lead singer of Bodybag, Sammy Mitchell. Rasping breath walks the hallway. Clawed hands emerge. The chained hands grab a blade to destroy the shackles. When that doesn't work, one hand chops off the other.

Alex wakes up. The Devo score kicks in.

Cut to the following day. Alex leaves class with Jack and Marty. One reads in the newspaper about the US closing Alcatraz to tourists after the band Bodybag, who was touring the facilities, turned up dead and mangled. The tour guide discovered the lead singer in a cellblock, chained to the water sprinkler system.

But forget that! Alex and Jan have to grab burgers while Alex's brother, Richard, and Richard's girlfriend, Krista, fuck. Jan is trying her best, but Alex is distant and weird. He feels the wall flexing behind him. A clawed hand reaches through the wall. But when he looks behind him, nothing has happened.

Dreams and reality are blurring together for Alex. Are they premonitions? A warning? Thankfully, one of Alex's teachers is an occultist who explains everything. What she can't answer awaits him at Alcatraz.

Krista tries to get Jan to hook up with Alex, but Jan has major sapphic friend desire:
<blockquote><i>— How do I look?
— Even the small percentage of male hormones in my body tingle just to be near you.
— I hope Richard's do the same.</i></blockquote>

I wouldn't say this movie has a promising start, but it at least has consistent nightmare moments. Once they arrive at Alcatraz, the energy peters out for most of the runtime. Like, when you throw in a montage of all the gore scenes thus far an hour into the movie, you know you're struggling to keep the audience interested.

When Alex was a child, an associate of his father's entered the house with a gun and killed both his parents. The associate wore a mask made from a fox pelt. The memory has haunted him ever since.

As an adult, Alex is an aspiring writer. His brother Jack wants Alex to join his company, but Alex won't abandon his dream. He still sees the man in the pelt mask, but his friend Danny assures him he's making something out of nothing. Danny gives Alex a pill to keep him from dreaming, but the void that comes with it is hard to bear.

Danny introduces Alex to Maggie. Though they have a rocky start, the two start dating. Everything is looking up for Alex. But his internal world is falling apart. What is a nightmare, and what is reality for Alex? 

The film is cheap and not well-acted, but the script is pretty decent! The cinematography makes some artistic choices in places that work for me. I mean, it sort of disintegrates in the third act twist factory, but it never loses me.

The characters are terminally unlikeable, but that's such a common problem with horror movies that I tend to tolerate them if I'm into the story. Best of all, the direction is sharp—too many women second-unit directors were relegated to cheap horror and erotica.

Alex's fixation on Maggie has classic disorganized attachment written all over it. He falls in love with her while barely knowing her, then totally derails when he learns anything about her, especially if what he thought wasn't true.

I'm not saying this is a lost classic. I'm just saying this movie is better than any straight-to-VHS psychological horror ought to be.

We open on an elaborate setup with a show rehearsal, but it's just fodder for a woman changing and two murder scenes, each performed by a killer in a monster mask with clawed gloves.

Melanie sends her daughter, Clarissa, to a friend's place. With the house to herself, she makes herself a sandwich and sits on the couch to watch TV. But they're talking about the masked killer, which freaks Melanie out. Then, she gets a call from her drunk husband. She tells him to stop calling her.

For whatever reason, Melanie pulls out her breasts and looks at them in the mirror for a bit. Then, she receives a separate, much more obscene phone call from someone else. She reports it to the police. Then, they call again. From the house phone. And then walk in while on the phone. It's the monster mask guy, surprise. He lifts his mask, but the camera pushes in so we can only see her dead-eyed stare.

Cut to the hospital. Melanie has somehow survived the killer's attack. Detective Clark and Dr. Willow are on the case. But there's only one problem—Melanie has amnesia from the experience and cannot remember her name, let alone the identity of the killer. If she's still alive, though, the killer will try coming for her again. Will Clark and Willow be able to stop him in time?

Claudio Fragasso, who also wrote and directed <i>Troll 2</i>, showcases a similar tin ear for dialogue, poor comprehension of story, and inability to direct tone changes. Folks speculate on whether Fragasso is aware he's making terrible movies, but to arrive at this movie intentionally is a feat no irony-poisoned trash director has managed.

The movie will cut to random murder scenes unrelated to the main story. I assume that these are Bruno Mattei's contributions.

We join a lingerie photoshoot. Sylvia robes up. David congratulates her on the shoot and assigns her to an upcoming music video called ""Blades."" An older man calls Alex, the assistant, asking for a date with Sylvia. Alex tries to decline, but the man threatens to call the police.

The models attend a house party at Alex's and relax in a hot tub. The older man joins them, jumping on Syliva. The other models tell Sylvia that he's an important friend and not to worry. She fights him off, but the other models hold her down while the older man SAs her. Sylvia escapes and drives off in Alex's 1987 Autobianchi Y10.

Alex meets with David, who shows Alex a strange blade for the upcoming music video. Alex claims Sylvia disappeared, so David tries to do the video without her. During the shoot (which is to Frankie Goes to Hollywood's ""Warriors of the Wasteland""), Police Lieutenant Brandam speaks with Alex about his car, which police discovered in a ditch. The gas tank exploded, and they found the charred remains of someone in the driver's seat. Alex gives Brandam the details but omits the presence of the older man. 

What happened to Sylvia? Was this an accident, or is this part of an elaborate scheme? I mean, probably the latter, right? When Melanie takes Syliva's place in the shoot, she finds herself taking over Syliva's life. Meanwhile, the other models start dying under mysterious circumstances.

The score is so good — horny guitar and lurid synths for days. The soundtrack picks are also pretty stellar. I'd never heard ""Certain Things Are Likely"" by Kissing the Pink, but it's a jam. It pivots mid-movie to a Psycho riff that I'm ambivalent about, but thankfully it's used sparingly.

The movie features several computer shots, from Alex playing something called ""Porno Game"" to forensic scientists recreating Sylvia's skull.

The film feels like it's going for a Tony Scott slo-mo fest. Director Dario Piana had worked in commercials before this, so the highly stylized aesthetic makes sense. I don't know how much it adds beyond verisimilitude for the video shoots—the same aesthetic applied to a lingerie shoot and putting sheets on a bed is pretty funny—but beautiful cinematography helps the slasher go down.

<b>Auvers-sur-Oise, France, 1890</b>
<blockquote><i>On Sunday, July 27, one Van Gogh, aged 37, Dutch painter staying at Auvers, shot himself with a revolver in the fields, but being only wounded, returned to his room, where he died two days later.</i><blockquote>

<b>Arles, France, 1891</b>
<blockquote><i>We cannot speak except by our paintings.</i> — Van Gogh</blockquote>

So, here's a movie that tries to do all the speaking for him.

The camera pulls out of the east-facing window of Van Gogh's asylum room in Saint-Rémy, from which he painted Starry Night, morphing into the streets of Arles. Armand Roulin punches a man in the face on behalf of his father, Joseph, before entering Café de la Gare, the subject of The Night Café painting. A policeman inquires about the fight, learning that it was over ""Crazy Red,"" a nickname given to Van Gogh.

Armand dropped a letter in the scuffle, written to Theo van Gogh, Vincent's brother. Geno, Vincent's old landlord, found it among Vincent's things when clearing the place and gave it to Joseph. Joseph gave it to Armand to deliver to Theo. Joseph finds Vincent's suicide hard to believe and hopes that Armand can learn more about what happened.

Armand isn't keen to deliver the letter, as the town had put together a petition to kick Vincent out of town, and his father didn't sign it, making the Roulin family pariahs. The subject of Vincent's painting, La Mousmé, vocalizes that she signed the painting. For some reason, the film turns the Japanese woman in the painting white — I guess because they hired a white actor and the painters didn't want to take ""artistic liberties."" 

Anyway, through flashbacks and investigation, Armand learns about Van Gogh's final days before his death.

<a href=""https://boxd.it/69nxzt"">I saw The Peasants</a>, the follow-up from these directors when it came out. Like this film, the gimmick is impressive. In both cases, it's apparent that the movie was filmed and made, and then artists rotoscoped over each frame. 

Here, at least, the artistic style centers the film (except for the flashbacks, which are in a similar representative style to The Peasants). While the story is equally slight, it has more intrigue at its center. (Even though the film takes wild liberties with Van Gogh's life, I would not trust any biographical information it relays.)

I'm not saying, ""Therefore, it's bad."" I am saying that if the story cannot stand up without the style applied, then the style isn't worth much to me. Add to that the insult of a narrative so overwrought and overexplained that it makes one wonder what the filmmakers's interest in Van Gogh was in the first place if they cannot leave a single second to abstraction or interpretation.","amazon prime, anti-criterion challenge 2024, acc2024",2025-02-01

<blockquote><i>Memory is a selection of images, some elusive, others printed indelibly on the brain. The summer I killed my father, I was 10 years old.</i></blockquote>

It's evening in Eve's Bayou in 1962. The Batistes, well-off descendants of the French aristocrats who founded the town, throw a house party where people dance, drink, and gossip. Eve Batiste walks around with a box of chocolates, offering them to her uncle Harry and her younger brother Poe. Their mother, Roz, watches the mischievous Eve affectionately. When Poe fills his mouth with them, Eve tells Poe they're chocolate-covered bees. Their older sister, Cisely, stops them with Shakespeare and recruits them to hand our champagne.

Louis, their father, steps onto the dance floor with Matty Meraux, a family friend. After the song, Louis takes the drink tray from Cisely's hands and puts it in Eve's so he can dance with Cisely. Dejected, Cisely runs out to the carriage house, napping in a carriage. The sound of moans and clanking wakes her up. She sits up to see her father having sex with Matty.

Louis asks Matty to leave while he talks with Eve. Louis walks with Eve, dotting her with affection and attention through champagne-stained words.  Roz finds the two talking and sends Eve upstairs to bed. Upstairs, while getting ready for bed, Eve breaks down and tells Cisely what she saw between Louis and Mrs. Meraux. Cisely refuses to believe it, telling Eve that Louis and Matty were sharing a joke and that Eve misinterpreted what she saw.

That night, Eve dreams of her uncle Harry dying. When she wakes up, she learns that it is true. The film follows Eve that summer through dreams and memories, secrets and premonitions, that show her a world much different than she thought it was.

The film explores the world of grief, secret-keeping, and pain that Black women carry, especially those who try to uphold the nuclear family. When the family comes apart, the women bear the burden of what is lost—less privileged than the men in their lives and afforded far fewer passes for any perceived slights or sins.

Though the film isn't horror, it contains cinematic elements often reserved for the genre. Kasi Lemmons pulls a similar tone blend in The Caveman's Valentine, though more effectively here.

Both Eve and her Aunt Mozelle have visions. The images are black-and-white montages, disparate elements that only add to a whole for those who know the truth. What we see doesn't tell us the complete story, and what we recognize doesn't get us any closer.

Perhan feeds and cares for his sister Danira. His grandmother, Khatidža, brings home a turkey. Perhan plays the accordion while the turkey gobbles along. Azra comes over to hang out with Perhan. That night they go to a movie and make out under the bleachers. He stops to show her his psychic abilities by moving a can. Later, he goes to Azra's to ask her family to grant them a marriage. Azra's mother refuses. 

So, Perhan drafts a suicide note and swallows it so that no one will know his shame. He hangs himself from the rope of the bell tower, but a townsperson finds him pulls him down, and takes him home. Khatidža explains that Azra's mother will not allow the marriage because Perhan is the illegitimate son of a Slovenian soldier who impregnated his late mother and left her destitute.

At the Feast of St. George, Azra and Perhan make love in a boat. So, Perhan decides he will do whatever it takes to win Azra's mother over. If she wants wealth, then Perhan will determine how to make money. Perhaps his psychic powers can help him?

The film is a Dickensian parable about legacy and morality. Perhan is a boy who wishes to live an honest life but is dealt a tragic origin from which he cannot escape, and people around him take advantage of his earnest nature. The culture he comes up in is Yugoslav Romani, a people without a land to call their own—eternal nomads, hated and scorned by those around them. He isn't doomed to a life of crime, but his naivete makes him an easy mark.

Also, the boundaries between magic and reality are blurred. Khatidža has the power of healing. Sometimes, people will float — I thought this signified a dream, but nope, they just do that. 

The movie goes to great lengths to build its world. I felt lost (in a good way) as I waited to see what story emerged. I felt a little disappointed when the story kicked in. It's another, ""The dishonest way to wealth will always bite you.""

Asmae El Moudier works with her father, Mohamed, to create a miniature recreation of the street she grew up on in the Sebata district of Casablanca. Using the set, she recreates memories from her childhood perspective while folding in stories she learns from her family. The story begins with a lie her grandmother Zahra told the family: that taking a photograph is a sin.

As a child, Asmae slipped out of her house during Laylat al-Qadr, a festival where children dress as adults in traditional clothes. Little girls could dress as brides on the Amaria throne and get their photos taken. Because Asmae could not afford the throne experience, she got her photo taken in front of a backdrop depicting Hawaii. This would be the first photo of her and her last for a while.

The film travels to the neighborhood to capture footage of the area to accompany the miniatures and to inform the miniature depiction, as the family has no documents of their experiences.

In confronting this lie her grandmother told, the director is not chasing capital-T truth but rather a proliferation of perspectives and the understanding that comes with them. With no documented photos of events, her household contained multiple interpretations of the same events.

Asmae spent years trying to convince her grandmother to be in the documentary. After all, this would be documenting her. It was only through hiring a woman to tell her grandmother's stories that she relented.

What feels like a gimmick at first arrives at a place of catharsis and processing of trauma for people whose stories went unheard until this documentary. Through this form of storytelling, the documentary unveils darker stories, such as the violent military crackdown in Asmae's neighborhood during the 1981 Bread Riots.

<blockquote><i>The African Kingdom of Dahomey is at a crossroads. A new king, Ghezo, has just taken power. Their enemy, the Oyo Empire, has joined forces with the Mahi people to raid Dahomey villages and sell their captives to European slavers, an evil trade that has pulled both nations into a vicious circle. The powerful Oyo have new guns and horses, but the young king has his own fearsome weapon: an elite force of female soldiers, the Agojie, led by a general, Nanisca. Now, these warriors are all that stand between the Oyo and Dahomey’s annihilation.</i></blockquote>

The Agojie raids the Mahi village to save the Dahomean women they abducted to sell as slaves. Horseshoes prove Nansica right—the Oyo were responsible. They’ll need stronger warriors to prepare for the coming battles.

White people have released fetishized historical epics since the dawn of cinema, hitting the peak with movies like <i>Braveheart</i> and <i>Gladiator</i>. However, they’ve never been accurate historical epics—in fact, they often rewrite history to make heroes out of objective villains. Entertainment, not education, is the goal.

Finally, we get a big-budget historical action flick directed by and starring black women. The film rewrites history, portraying slave traders as reformed heroes. However, if the aim is mere equality, the film should receive the same leniency as its predecessors.

I hate <i>Braveheart</i> and don’t give a fuck about <i>Gladiator</i>. I didn’t like Robert Eggers’s attempt with <i>The Northman</i>. This was never going to be something I loved.

This movie was wildly successful, and it would be idiotic for studios not to fund more projects like this. Just because I’m not the target audience doesn’t mean I don’t support it being made.","hulu, anti-criterion challenge 2024, acc2024, written by women, directed by women, edited by women",2025-02-03

At a genetic research facility, two scientists look at a strange growth on an X-ray of a cat. They bring the beautiful orange boy in, but he slips away. The scientists sound the alarm, and a patrol of hazmat suits chase him down, tranquilizer and crate in hand. They tranq the cat, only for a smaller, mutated cat to crawl out of its mouth and kill them all.

A lockdown goes into effect. One of the scientists grabs a security guard's gun as they sweep the parking deck for the mewing little dummy who doesn't know what's happening. But the kitty manages to take them all out and escape through an air duct into the bustling city.

Meanwhile, Suzanne and Bobbi, dressed for spring break, try to stay at a luxury hotel, only for millionaire Walter Graham to take an interest in them. He feeds them dinner and offers them a spot on his luxury yacht, which takes off at midnight. Little do they know that Walter has set up this rendevous as a means of escaping criminal prosecution from the SEC. 

I could describe the plot machinations that lead the cat to be on the boat. It involves a mugging, a car wreck, and the word ""arbitrageur."" Regardless, Suzanne finds him at the dock and brings him on. Suzanne and Bobbi also invite some horny boys, so the cat has more folks to murder.

<b>Watching the Fade to Black & White version</b>

Thirteen years ago, Lee Geum-ja went to prison for abducting and killing Park Won-mo, a 6-year-old boy. Not only that, she eagerly confessed to the crime. A preacher, when watching a tabloid piece on her on TV, believed he saw an angel. So, he visited her in prison, leading to a conversion, after which Geum-ja became a model prisoner, caring for others and praying diligently.

In 2004, a line of Santas, led by that preacher, sing hymns to welcome Geum-ja back to the world as the prison lets her go. The preacher presents her with a block of tofu, a symbol that she will live white as snow and never sin again. Geum-ja flips the plate over and tells the preacher to screw himself.

Geum-ja calls in favors with those she met and cared for in prison. That night, Geum-ja dreams of leading a man with a dog's body to a wintry ridge and shooting him in the head. The next day, she puts her plan into motion for revenge.

The thing is, the detective in her case never believed she did it. Still, he provided her with crucial details to make her confession believable. Why? What is this plan? 

<blockquote><i>It has to be pretty. Everything has to be pretty.</i></blockquote>

The film is, obviously, a meditation on revenge. The film is the third in a trilogy of movies that focus on revenge. What is the appropriate revenge for killing a child? Your child? Multiple children? How do you arrive at justice? Where is the line between a thirst quenched and a new guilt born? In the fantasy, it is as simple as pulling the trigger. In reality, the world is not as black and white as all that. Or… is it?

Though <i>Oldboy</i> was the first Park Chan-wook movie I saw, <i>I'm a Cyborg but That's OK</i> was the first movie of his I fell in love with. I bring it up because Lady Vengeance bears several tonal similarities with that movie in how it shuffles around events and pieces the story together. They also share a dark humor that hits a sweet spot for me.

Don't get me wrong — this movie has levity that only increases as the movie continues. The Fade to Black & White version I watched emphasizes this with the slow removal of color from the movie, ending in black and white. This movie fucked with me in ways only Park Chan-wook can. I'm never prepared for where it goes. And yet, he'll pull a laugh out of you at the strangest time imaginable.

Lee Young-ae, who plays Geum-ja, has such charisma and complexity in her performance that holds the film together. Her journey is so multi-faceted. It would've been good without her, but she makes it truly great. Her makeup is fucking on point too.

I feel totally manipulated when I watch Park Chan-wook films. He is a cruel jester who uses his mastery of cinema in the most bizarre ways, and I adore it. This movie had a chokehold on me within seconds. When it let go, I was asking for the safety of the chokehold.","tubi, asiancinemachallenge2023, asiancc2023, asiancc2023week3",2025-02-03

<b>Champaner, 1893</b>
The agricultural village of Champaner gives a lagaan (a portion of the farmer's harvest) to the king as a tax. The king, Raja Puran Singh, keeps one share and gives the rest to the British, who promise to protect the king from neighboring attacks while promising the other kings protection from Raja Singh. It is monsoon season, and the village has seen no rain all year.

Bhuvan throws rocks at impalas to startle them and prevent British Captain Andrew Russell from shooting them. He catches on and threatens to shoot Bhuvan the next time he tries. Russell meets with Raja Singh, who hopes to clear a way for his people to pray at Siddheshwar temple. The village believes that praying there will end their hardships. Raja Diler Singh, an enemy of Raja Puran Singh and a friend of Andrew Russell, rules the land. Russell will do it if the king, a Hindu, will eat meat. The king, of course, refuses, so Russell doubles the lagaan.

On hearing the news, Bhuvan leads a group to speak to the king and plead for a waiver. The guards make the men wait while the Britsh play cricket. They observe the similarities in this game to the kid's game, gillidanda. The ball rolls over to the men, and Bhavan picks it up, so they arrest him. The king hears their plea, as does Captain Russell. Russell offers to cancel the tax if they beat the British in a game of cricket. If they lose, the British will triple the tax.

As a nearly 4-hour film (aka average length Bollywood picture), it takes around 45 minutes for the premise to come into focus. As an underdog tale, it also lends itself to criticizing the caste system and allowing someone of a lower caste to join the team based on their skill. It's not complex or anything, but it's there.

The movie lacks any tension until the final 45 minutes when the movie lets us non-cricket watchers in on what needs to happen for a win. I still relied on when characters cheered or groaned to know, but at least I had a foothold.

Similar to how <i>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</i> introduced many Westerners to wuxia, this movie introduced them to Bollywood epics. Both hoped to make these regional films more popular in the US, but neither made any impact beyond their award-winning years. <i>R.R.R.</i> came out 20 years later with similar hopes for Tollywood, but no dice.

While this is a better-made movie than <i>R.R.R.</i>, it lacks the absurd physical feats that made <i>R.R.R.</i> such a blast. This movie, however, has much better music, thanks to A.R. Rahman. They're different cultures, so it's like comparing mandarins to pomelos. But still, this movie has some catchy songs.

Gracy Singh, who plays Gauri, is the best actor in the movie. She hits the sweet spot between comic and sincere, even when the script relegates her character to pine after Bhuvan. Aamir Khan commits to the stoic expressionlessness of a handsome protagonist whose intrigue comes second.

This movie is surprisingly easy to watch for its 4-hour runtime. But much of what it does isn't what I enjoy watching, whether Hollywood or Bollywood.","anti-criterion challenge 2024, acc2024",2025-02-04

Allan goes running one morning, only to be hit by a truck. The hospital performs spinal surgery, saving Allan's life but rendering him quadriplegic. Allan's mother tries to tend to his every need—for those she can't, she hires a nurse named Maryanne to assist.

Allan, finding the adjustment to his new life unmanageable, attempts to take his life. Geoffrey, a friend of Allan's, suggests a program that trains capuchins to assist people with disabilities. But Geoffrey has an ulterior motive. He has been experimenting with capuchins in his lab, trying to create a serum that makes them more intelligent. Geoffrey's efforts in the lab have hit a wall, so he wants to test his capuchin, Ella, in another environment. So, he gives Ella to a woman who specializes in training the monkeys, and she helps train Ella for the job.

What could go wrong?

The movie gives us a heads up before it begins that Helping Hands at Boston Univeristy trained the capuchins featured to assist people with disabilities and that none were harmed, despite appearances. It also ensures in the credits that no cases like this have ever occurred in their program. Due to states outlawing primates in homes and the Americans with Disabilities Act recognizing only dogs and mini horses as service animals, the program has since pivoted to tech/AI solutions.

The film contrasts how the scientists who train capuchins to assist people with disabilities draw out the heretofore unseen potential in their intelligence vs. Geoffrey's method of injecting it into the animal and asking it to play chess. It speaks to our limited understanding of what intelligence is. Behavioral scientists have long limited their scope on what constitutes intelligence in animals. Meanwhile, we continue to witness complex rituals, linguistic patterns, and mannerisms that we previously only thought humans were capable of.

Like other work by Romero, it also explores hubris and the cost of wanton experimentation with only an eye on the bottom line and not on the ramifications.

You'll be disappointed if you watch this expecting a schlocky horror movie. This film is sci-fi horror in the most classic sense. The film dedicates the time to letting us get to know our characters and what is at play. The movie's first half could easily be mistaken for a lighthearted drama if not for Geoffrey's monkeying around 😏.

Though the characters treat Ella as the film's antagonist, she is not the villain. She is a product of the experimentation done on her and the hostile environment of Allan's home. Her sensitivity to Allan's every need creates a codependence where his anger becomes hers and hers his.

<b>Actor talk:</b>
Stephen Root appears as Dean Burbage, the earliest movie role I've seen him in. 
Jason Beghe seems like such a boy scout, so every swear word out of his mouth sounds like his first time saying it. 
Boo, who plays Ella, is so sweet and such a tremendous animal actor. The filmmaking ensures only a few cutaways occur when she performs complex tasks so we can see what she is capable of.

Like many directors, Romero was constantly frustrated with the studio's handling of the film. Although this was only his second studio film, Romero returned to independent films for the remainder of his career.

Because of studio meddling, we must evaluate the movie as it is rather than what Romero wanted. Thankfully, it's still a pretty great movie.","plutotv, birth year challenge, byc, nature attacks",2025-02-04

<blockquote><i>Ripe plums are falling… may a fine lover come for me while there is still time.</i></blockquote>

New Day Books is an independently-owned New York bookstore where the New York intelligentsia mingle. The store is celebrating its fundraising goal and ability to stay open another year. Isabelle, who works at the store, walks around, picks up trash, and checks on folks. Isabelle prides herself on knowing famous writers, publishers, and editors and longs to be part of that world herself.

Local author Anton Maes notices Isabelle and ushers Isabelle over. Through awkward exchanges, he signs one of his books, The Cave Dweller, which the store has featured in their window for three weeks, and gives it to Isabelle.

Back at her apartment, Nick surprises her and follows her in. He offers to stay the night. Isabelle asks about his wife, Katrina. She agrees.

The next day, she takes the subway across Delancey St. to the Lower East Side to visit with her bubbe Ida, who gives her $500 for ""pulling whiskers."" At the park, Ida surprises Isabelle with a shadchanit (Jewish marriage broker) named Hannah. Through her, Isabelle meets Sam, who runs a corner picket stand.

Isabelle's options are appearing, but is she open to these possibilities? She claims to be happy with her life among the literati. But life doesn't write stories. It composes music—sometimes familiar melodies, but always room for surprises.

The film explores modernity vs. tradition and how it affects Isabelle's future. Isabelle is THE modern woman (as of 1988): independent, successful, and happy. Her bubbe lives in an area of New York that has historically upheld traditional Jewish culture from Poland and the Russian Empire. To cross Delancey is to step back into a tradition that Isabelle has moved away from, living in uptown Manhattan. She hires the marriage broker, much to Isabelle's chagrin, but meets Sam, who challenges her idea of what a successful man looks like.

Even the modern Gentile Anton talks of ripe plums falling, a Confucian poem about growing old before you can bear children. But Anton is also worldly, speaking French to the wait staff and writing poetry in conversation. He represents the epitome of what Isabelle wants for herself. Of course, Anton is also married and has a tumultuous relationship with his wife, who he rarely sees anymore.

The movie also interrogates the loneliness of modern city life. When one becomes independent from tradition, they are separate from social groups they may have joined. Modernity promises new cultures and a global menu of spaces to which you can belong. But if you are picking a little of this and a little of that, then where is the commitment? If Isabelle is looking for a life partner, can she find it in the modern world?

Neither option is perfect for Isabelle. She must change something about her life to accommodate a man. Also, dating blows no matter how you cut it.

You may think you know where this movie is going, but, you know, music, surprises, and all that.

Man, this one crept up on me! I love the Roches soundtrack. I love Peter Riegert, Reizl Bozyk, and David Hyde Pierce. This film is a rom-com that earns both parts of the genre.","criterion channel, anti-criterion challenge 2024, acc2024, criterion, written by women, directed by women",2025-02-05

What works in this movie is cinematography. While the plotting is tedious, the flick has some stellar sequences, including a slow-motion flashback that had me floored.

The set is pretty decent—I'm always a sucker for gothic castles.

Honestly, my biggest problem with the movie is the treatment of the cats. All the cats are in that small cage, crawling over each other. One gets thrown around, and one gets held underwater. It's not my thing.

Vadym, a sound engineer in Kyiv, has earned extra income through field recordings. While he was previously employed on a movie set, he has since resigned. Furthermore, Vadym requires funds for an expensive dental surgery he recently underwent.

He drops off some recordings for a Ukrainian video game studio and asks if they have other opportunities. They have an offer from a Canadian video game studio that wants local Ukrainian fauna for their Noah's Ark video game. But they have a head office position in Canada for Vadym if he can capture the song of the near-extinct Fussy Mallad that you can only find at Lake Chendesh in Transcarpathia and who only sings once a year.

So, Vadym jumps on the train back to his hometown of Uzhhorod. He plans to have his grandfather drive him around while he's there, but he backs out. So, Vadym will have to stay with and get rides from his taxi-driving, Victoria Beckham-obsessed mother, Halyna. Will he be able to get the sounds he needs?

The film starts with an absurdist sense of humor. A dentist explains that all maladies (except tooth decay) can be healed through positive thinking. A young woman cleaning the rotating glass doors of an office. When we see her again, she turns into an old woman. Vadym's alarm goes off, and he can't get it to stop, so he follows the wire around the whole house. It leads him right back to the alarm.

As it goes, it turns into a road movie, where Vadym observes the quiet suffering his mom has experienced. This part of the movie dragged for me because it hit too many of the same notes. But as the third act comes in and the story takes a couple of unexpected turns, the purpose comes into focus.

The history of Ukraine is one of crushing defeat. From the Ottoman Empire's takeover of the Kingdom of Hungary in 1526 to the occupation of Crimea and the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War, Ukrainians have known the boot of an oppressor on their neck for centuries and borders that have ruptured brotherhoods. And yet, the people find a way. Their victories are not epic Hollywood moments. They are small, almost unrecognizable at times.

Vadym feels defeated in his life, both personal and professional. The Canada offer is a victory after years of defeat. But the request is so absurd that it feels like a miracle must occur for him to find it. On his journey, he meets people who have lost loved ones and whose brothers have become their enemies. He also experiences the brutality of raw authority with no aim other than to exercise it.

More simply, the movie is also about motherhood. From Mary the Mother of Christ to Halyna, these are women who gave everything for their children and had to deal with the possibility of losing them. I can't say too much because everything gels in the final few minutes of the movie.

I'm pretty unfamiliar with Ukrainian history, so if I've misrepresented something here, call me out. I've tried to do some reading for this review to understand why Ukraine considers this one of their best movies.

I can't say I fully understand. I can say that the movie treats its audience with intelligence, building a subtly clever and reflective film that made my mouth drop when the credits rolled.","torrent, anti-criterion challenge 2024, acc2024",2025-02-06

Julien, a 14-year-old boy, walks down the street in a gi, walking like a side-scrolling video game character, throwing punches and kicks. He is recreating the moves from his favorite arcade game, Kung Fu Master. The objective is to fight through the floors of a pagoda to rescue the damsel in distress. 

Lucy, also a teenager, throws a party in the backyard. Lucy's mother, Mary-Jane, watches from the balcony, checking on Lucy's sick younger sister, Lou. Mary-Jane finds Julien in the bathroom, sitting on the floor drunk. She shows him a trick to induce vomiting. As the kids are leaving, Julian watches Mary-Jane sing to Lou. She tells Julien to go home. Lucy tells Mary-Jane a joke that Julien told her. Mary-Jane reflects on Julien's eyes as he watches her sing. How pathetic, yet how wonderful. 

Mary-Jane drives to Lucy's school to see if she can run into Julian. Instead, she accidentally taps him with her car. Mary-Jane sees his hand is scuffed, so she offers to take him to a café. She buys him a Coke and gives him 5 francs to play Kung Fu Master. Mary-Jane watches him play and explain the game, inching closer to him.

Back home, the quietness of domestic life feels lonely. Mary-Jane thinks of seeing Julien again. She tells Lucy about being her age and loving a man 20 years her senior, unable to touch him, but talking and talking. Looking back, she wasn't that into him, just flattered that he was so into her.

The movie follows Mary-Jane as she looks for opportunities to see Julien again and Julien, her.

In 1971, Serge Gainsbourg released a concept album called Histoire de Melody Nelson, describing a romance between the middle-aged narrator and a 14-year-old girl, portrayed on the album and the cover art by Jane Birkin, who was Gainsbourg's partner at the time and 20 years his junior.

While filming Jane B. par Agnès V., Jane Birken presented Agnès Varda with a story she wanted to tell about an older woman falling in love with a teenage boy, or the teenage boy falling in love with her. They stopped filming Jane B., Varda wrote the script, and they filmed Kung-Fu Master before resuming Jane B. Varda chose her son Mathieu to play the teenage boy. Jacques Demy, Mathieu's father, was hesitant until Jane brought her daughters, Charlotte Gainsbourg and Lou Doillon, onto the project.

Loneliness finds fixations. Limerance is its favorite pastime. But people have feelings and their own fixations. It's easier to long for what you can't have: an ex, a memory, an expensive trip. People who have a partner, the family, the vacations love to tell you that love will find you when you least expect it. Or urge you to have fun on their behalf because you're single and they aren't. It's all projections of desire.

We open with a black-and-white documentary about Darkest Peru, where a British explorer discovers a new bear species. He intends to kill it to have a specimen for the British Museum, but one bear stops him and saves him from a scorpion. So, as is the British tradition, he introduces the bears to the most advanced technology, from telescopes to marmalade. To his surprise, the bears are capable of human speech. He names the bears after people he knows, Pastuzo and Lucy.

Years pass, and Pastuzo and Lucy care for their orphaned nephew. The nephew forages oranges and introduces them to an industrial assembly line to produce marmalade. Pastuzo and Lucy dream of traveling to London to visit their British explorer friend—after all, he is the one who civilized these creatures. An earthquake sends the bears running to their shelter. Pastuzo does not make it, and the nephew finds Pastuzo's hat, assuming he has died.

So Lucy stows the nephew away on a boat to London while she moves into the Home for Retired Bears. ""They will not have forgotten how to treat a stranger,"" says Lucy. From the boat, he jumps on a mail truck and arrives at Paddington Station. The sea of white Londoners, quite accustomed to ignoring immigrants and minorities, pass by the nephew without a second thought. The Brown family leaves a train. Henry, the father, sees the nephew and encourages the kids to keep their eyes down and ignore him. But Mary, the mother, finds the nephew's exoticism charming. Finding his birth name too difficult to pronounce, they name him Paddington after the station.

The film follows Paddington and the Browns as the Browns learn to love Paddington and help him navigate a London that distrusts migrants of all species.

The film has good intentions in its exploration of British colonialism. We are supposed to see Paddington arriving ""as he is,"" and the lesson for Londoners to accept him rather than send him back where he came from, as is the current majority mindset. But in this story, Britain has already assimilated Paddington's family. They speak English and are aware of British technology and idioms. They've even adopted industrialization. When Paddington arrives in London, he shows an earnest politeness and deference to authority—all classically ""British"" traits.

Yes, this helps clarify the point: if all that is different about Paddington is that he is a bear, then why all the distrust? But when the story paints Paddington as ""one of the good ones,"" the analogy only gets so far.

The film is cute and more thoughtful than most children's movies in how it approaches its subject. Some of the jokes made me chuckle. But the whiteness on screen and in the filmmaking crew only highlights how little progress Britain has made post-colonialism.","hulu, anti-criterion challenge 2024, acc2024",2025-02-07

The team gathers in an armored truck and plans a raid on an apartment block. The MBC target is a crime lord named Tama Riyadi, who has an army of ""pushers, gangs, and killers."" He has been running out of this block for 10 years, with police unable to approach. It's time to change that.

When the MBCs get into the building, they find two spotters. They shoot one, but the other can radio in that the police are here. Rama turns the radio off, but it's too late. Tama is standing in front of the surveillance center, calling for backup. Tama's men wipe out most of the team. Tama then announces over the intercom system that anyone who takes the rest of the team out gets permanent free residence at the building.

And that's the movie. We get some minor twists, but it's more or less 100 minutes of fights. If you like pencak silat, this movie's got a bunch of it.

A younger me would have loved this movie, but today, I need more to keep me interested. I recognize that this movie is beloved among action fans and hugely influential—there's no <i>John Wick</i> without this movie.  It does what it says on the package, and not one iota more, and I can't fault it for that. But that doesn't mean I have to love it.","asiancinemachallenge2023, asiancc2023, asiancc2023week4",2025-02-07

<blockquote><i>[I] employed the term Chocolat for its 1950s slang meaning, ""to be had, to be cheated,"" and therefore the word's association of ""to be black and to be cheated.</i> — <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20070909025426/https://www.sensesofcinema.com/contents/cteq/01/17/chocolat.html"">Claire Denis</a></blockquote>

France Dalens, a white woman, sits on a beach in Cameroon, watching a black man and his child play in the waves. The man and his son lay down on the dark brown sand and let the waves ripple. France gets dressed, glances back at them, and walks towards Limbé. Some time passes, and a car pulls up, driven by the man from the beach. He offers her a ride to the bus station, but when he finds out she is also going to Douala, he offers her a ride there. As they drive along, France recalls her childhood memories of growing up in Cameroon.

We join France as a child riding in the back of a truck next to Protée, one of her family's house servants. The car pulls over to the side of the road. Her father, Marc, talks about widening the road. Her mother, Aimée, opens a picnic basket and doles out food. France takes the apple given to her and runs to the back of the truck, where Protée sits alone. She gives him some bread. He crosses the road to a small anthill and spreads the ants over the bread before bringing the bread back. He offers it to France in exchange for the answer to a riddle.

The film observes the day-to-day colonial life of the Dalens in French Cameroon from France's perspective. Through this, we learn about her relationship with Protée—what they share, spoken and unspoken. At times, we get glimpses of Protée's experience outside the Dalens, allowing us to see the contrast between his identity outside and within the home.

Throughout the film, we witness the friendship develops between France and Protée. When France eats, Protée stands by the table—she demands that he eat with her and feeds him some of the soup he prepared for her. For Protée, his riddles seem complex, but France knows their answers almost immediately. There is a kinship to their experience as observers of other people's lives. 

We also discover sexual tension between Aimée and Protée. Though neither addresses it directly, Aimée's frustrations manifest in how she bosses around Protée and the excuses she has to bring him into her presence.

<blockquote><i>When you look towards the hills, where there are no more huts and trees when the earth and the sky touch, it's the horizon. […] The closer you get to the line, the further it gets. If you walk towards it, it moves further away—it escapes you. […] You see the line, you see it, but it doesn't exist.</i></blockquote>

Denis's camera is a still observer, moving mostly in pans to connect disparate moments—from France to someone else or vice versa. Most motion comes from the camera riding in the car, surveying the African landscape. We, like France, must watch as the story unfolds, unable to intervene or change the circumstances. 

Though Abdullah Ibrahim's score covers some facets of the movie, most are silent, especially when surveying the landscape. In a rare moment, an Englishman visits, diegetic music scores their slow dance.

Though Denis's first film and her first exploring her childhood in French colonial Africa, it would not be her last. Her prior work with Jim Jarmusch and Wim Wenders shows in the stillness of this movie. It's a language that she will further refine in subsequent movies into something all her own.","criterion channel, birth year challenge, byc, written by women, directed by women",2025-02-08

<blockquote><i>When I was a kid and I got scared, the Rain Man would come sing to me.</i></blockquote>

Across the smoggy LA horizon, a crane carries a red Lamborghini, making it look almost like it's flying. The crane sets it down next to three other Lamborghinis. Charlie Babbitt looks over his purchase before driving off in his Ferrari 400i to the warehouse where he runs Babbitt Collectables. Charlie has a buyer for the Lambos, but the EPA is holding his cars at the port because they don't pass emission tests. In the meantime, Charlie has employees, Lenny and Susanna, lying at both ends of the deal to compensate for the holdup.

Satisfied, Charlie drives off with Susanna to Palm Springs. On the road, Lenny calls to inform Charlie that his estranged father, Sanford, has died. The funeral is tomorrow in Cincinnati, where they'll also settle the estate. Despite their rocky relationship, Susanna goes with Charlie to the funeral.

In the estate settlement, Charlie receives his father's 1949 Buick Roadmaster convertible, which was the cause of their estrangement (it doesn't matter how), and his father's rosebushes. The remaining $3 million estate goes into a trust fund for an unnamed beneficiary. Not content to let it lie, Charlie digs and finds his father directed the money to Wallbrook, a local mental institution. Through labored exchange, we get the reveal at the 20-minute mark: the money is going to a brother Charlie knew nothing about named Raymond, a man with high-functioning autism and savant syndrome.

So, Charlie steals Raymond from the facility for a road trip back to California in the Roadmaster. Will Charlie milk the $3 million out of Raymond? Will Susanna finally leave Charlie? Will Raymond get anything out of this experience?

What a slack, cheap movie. The script is stuffed to the 9s with hammy dialogue that explains how every character feels and how you should feel about it. Every scene seems 2-3 minutes longer than it needs to be.

See, Charlie is SUPPOSED to learn how to express his emotions. That's what Susanna complains about, how Charlie never talks about where he is or how he feels. So, in the light of someone with a neurodevelopmental condition that prevents him from expressing his emotions in a socially understood way, Charlie's frustrations with Raymond become Charlie's frustration with himself. 

It was also before Hollywood trusted people with autism to act, uh, autistic, so we have Dustin Hoffman's dedicated but sorely misguided performance. Sure, they decorate Wallbrook with people with autism, who can walk silently by and add verisimilitude.

Thanks to this movie, continuing down the line to Sheldons and Good Doctors, people continue to conflate autism and savant syndrome. Yes, folks with savant syndrome sometimes have savant syndrome, but the condition can arise from other neurodevelopmental conditions or brain injuries.

I like the cars. I like the neon lights. I like watching Tom Cruise throw a fit. I like some of the filmmaking decisions.

Joanna Kramer tells her seven-year-old son Billy that she loves him, running her hands through his hair as he falls asleep. She grabs a bag from the closet and packs some of her clothes. She sits on the couch and smokes until Ted gets home.

Ted Kramer sits with his boss, Jim. Ted realizes how late it is and tries to get home, but John offers him a promotion, putting him in charge of the Mid-Atlantic account. So, the two walk down the street a while longer before he finally makes it home. There, he ignores Joanna and makes some business calls. Joanna tells him that she's leaving him. He's annoyed that she picked now and tries to stop her. He wrangles her bag out of her hand, but she takes the elevator and leaves.

The film follows Ted and Billy as they adapt to this new life. Will Ted be able to show up as a father and continue his all-hours job? Will Joanna find happiness after six years of an unhappy marriage?

With a title like <i>Kramer vs. Kramer</i>, you think you would get both sides of this divorce. But no, Streep spends most of her time offscreen while Hoffman rants about his bitch wife, women's lib, and so on until he realizes he likes his kid and wants to be different.

Dustin Hoffman went method, which I guess means he had to hit, groupe, and taunt Meryl Streep, reminding her of her recently deceased fiancé, John Cazale, to ""draw a better performance out of her."" Streep wanted to rewrite her character to make her more sympathetic—though she couldn't make headway on the script, she succeeded through her performance. I understand every choice she makes, except for the last one.

The script is what shines here. I love how it captures Ted's changing priorities in small bits—walking at night hearing his boss's stories vs. walking during the day hearing his son's stories, then telling his boss stories about Billy.

My eyes glazed over during the court scenes. Also, the ending is total nonsense. Still, as a child of divorce, I think this movie got enough of it right that I appreciated what the movie did.","anti-criterion challenge 2024, acc2024, 1001 movies",2025-02-10

The glass shatters, and Tomek drops from the broken window. He enters an A/V room with a flashlight and surveys the tech on the shelves. There, he finds a telescope that he takes with him. Back home, he sharpens the focus on the apartment opposite him.

Magda arrives at the post office, where Tomek works at the front desk. She hands over a notice. He looks through the files for the corresponding money order. When she looks away, he glares at her. He tells her there is nothing for her. Frustrated, Magda storms out.

Tomek's godmother, with whom he lives while her son is away, invites him to watch Miss Poland. He obliges briefly before his alarm goes off. He turns it off, unveils the telescope, and looks through it to see Magda returning home. He makes instant coffee and buttered bread, watching, biting into his food when she bites into hers. Toek calls her to hear her voice but says nothing. When she hangs up, he calls back to apologize and then hangs up himself. A man comes over and starts fondling Magda. Tomek turns the telescope away. This time isn't the first he's seen her with someone, and it isn't the same man each time.

When Tomek learns that Magda is having problems with milk delivery to her apartment, Tomek takes the job to be closer to her. But Tomek will experience the stark difference between fantasy and reality.

<blockquote><i>— Why do people cry?
— You don't know? Haven't you ever cried?
— Once. A long time ago.</i></blockquote>The film expands on an episode from Decalogue, a ten-part miniseries where each episode focuses on one of the ten commandments. The original episode focused on ""Thou shalt not commit adultery."" In that sense, the title is ironic—this film is not portraying healthy love. Like all of the Decalogue episodes, it neither condones nor forbades— it merely observes.

In Decalogue, each episode features the Man in White, an ambiguous character one can view as God, the Devil, or no one. One reading suggests that he gives the characters their wish fulfillment so that they may learn the error of their ways.

It wouldn't serve much purpose if this film were only an expanded remake. Instead, the film revises elements of the story to explore a different approach. Grażyna Szapołowska, who plays Magda, contributed a different ending, which is no less bleak but plays into conventions surrounding romance, fantasy, and projection.

The film also expands on Tomek's mental state, giving us a more complex sense of what he is fundamentally missing inside, whether through repression or imbalance. He doesn't want to consummate any relationship with Magda—he only wants her to occupy his loneliness. He only breeches his line because his antics cause her suffering.

We also get a better sense of Magda's pain and why she would entertain the attention of a 19-year-old peeping tom. So many men have come and gone in her life—love starts at arousal and ends at orgasm. She carries a self-loathing that she deems the root of her problems in life—she isn't a good person, so why should anything good come to her?

We open on an Orthodox procession downstairs to a door on which the leading priest knocks. A voice on the other side refuses to open the door. So, the priest goes to the side door, kicks it down, and, we assume, beats the guy up.

Elia Suleiman sits outside a house at night, smoking a cigarette. Smash cut to daytime, where he waters a small tree in his home. Outside, Elia hears the church bells ding, so he pushes the minute hand of his grandfather clock 15 minutes ahead to be in sync. While drinking espresso outside, he sees a man in his lemon tree stealing lemons. The man assures Elia that he is not stealing because he intended to ask permission, but Elia doesn't answer the door.

Smash cut to him walking up the street. He hears shuffling and sees a group of men running toward him. But as Elia turns, the men slow their run to a walk to avoid suspicion. He turns around again, and they run past him, dispersing.

The film continues in these little vignettes. Eventually, Elia takes a plane to Paris and then to New York City. Strange experiences seem to follow him wherever he goes. Tanks roam the streets, police harass people, and everyone totes a gun.

The quiet absurdity of the style reminds me of Roy Andersson, but it is not quite as melancholic or grotesque. I thought I knew where several scenes were going, but they took an uncertain turn. 

I believe I watched something brilliant, but I would be lying if I said I understood the movie in total. I can't say if every scene has some political undertone—some scenes felt absurd for their own sake—but the commentary is unambiguous in places.

Even if I walked away understanding nothing about what the movie was saying, it was still a weird and hilarious experience.","anti-criterion challenge 2024, acc2024, edited by women, solidarity",2025-02-12

<blockquote><i>Sometimes, men are more harmful than ghosts.</i></blockquote>

The wind scatters leaves across the ground toward a door. The torn paper of the sliding doors reveals a light behind them. Inside, a man reads poetry, only to have his eyes distracted by Nip-Siu-sin dancing. His lamp tumbles over as he reaches up to her. She places his hand inside her shirt. The storm grows more intense as she sits atop him. Something rushes in from the storm and kills the man.

Ning Choi-san is a debt collector traveling in the pouring rain. He comes across thieves running from Hsia-hou. Hsia-hou decapitates one and slashes up the other, retrieving his bag. Once Ning arrives at his destination, he pulls out his balance book, only to find the rain has caused the ink to spread, making it impossible to decipher. Without a record, he cannot collect the tax.

So, Ning asks a nearby shopkeeper for a place to stay. The shop-keep suggests the Orchid Temple, which silences all townspeople in his vicinity. As night falls, wolves chase Ning to the temple. There, he witnesses Hsia-hou and Yin Chik-ha sword fighting. Hsia-hou escapes to the caves below to nurse his wounds. Yin Chik-ha warns Ning of the dangers inside the temple. Still, Ning enters and finds a place to rest. 

Beneath the temple, Hsia-hou finds Nip Siu-sin. As they kiss, shriveled remains come to life, and something rushes into Hsia-hou and sucks the life out of him. Nip Siu-sin watches tearfully. Yin Chik-ha, aware of the disturbance, finds Hsia-hou's body shriveled like the others. Meanwhile, Ning hears the clanking of bones upstairs and starts to investigate. But before he can, he hears a song. He follows the sound to find Nip Siu-sin.

Will Ning befall the same fate as others, or will he listen to Nip-Siu-sin and Yin Chik-ha's warnings? Or will he find love in a hopeless place?

The effects are so much fun! Cinefex Workshop was HK's first special effects studio—folks were teaching themselves stop-motion animation while working on the movie. The subtle animations of ghost spirit movement are such a nice touch.

The film has wuxia-style fights. The wind, costumes, and Dutch angles are incredible.

One character gives us some gender fuckery — I don't want to spoil it, but she rules.

It makes sense why this HK ghost movie broke through in America. It's fast-paced, funny, and full of surprises.

Beside him is a woman's purse, but no other bodies. They believe it to be Ko Jing-Min and call his younger sister, Ko Fon-Jiao, to identify the body. 

Wang Yi-Ming waits for his wife, Ruiyun, but neither he nor his employee, Miss Liu, know where she is. Ko Fon-Jiao, who lives next door, determined that Ruiyun and Jing-Min were lovers and had eloped. Humiliated, Yi-Ming becomes repressed, leaving his daughter Shuyuan feeling abandoned—she sings a song about it and everything. Meanwhile, Fon-Jiao becomes Shuyuan's friend and watches her when Yi-Ming is out.

Some time passes, and Ruiyun's sister, Ruimei, comes back to Taiwan from Singapore. Miss Liu sends Ruimei a letter to hire her as Shuyuan's tutor. Miss Liu hopes that the resemblance to Shuyan's mother will comfort Shuyan. A passenger on the train, recognizing the seal on the letter, fills Ruimei in on Yi-Ming's debauchery and abandonment of his daughter, predicting a terrible fate for her if she goes. It turns out that this is Fon-Jiao's younger brother.

What secrets await Ruimei? No one found her sister's body. Is she still alive? Or will Ruimei befall a similar fate?

Based on the Gothic novel Mistress of Mellyn, the Taiwanese Ministry of Culture considers this film one of the pinnacles of the first wave of Taiwanese-language cinema that ran from 1955-1972, starting with <i>Descendants of the Yellow Emperor</i> and fading with the influx of genre films in the 60s and 70s. Critics at the time considered the mix of family melodrama, romance, and supernatural elements to be quite experimental for the time.

This is the earliest Taiwanese film that Letterboxd categorizes as horror that I've been able to find. In 2018, the Taiwan Film Institute restored the film from a scratched-up print. The restoration looks outstanding. While some of the more ambitious effects are rough around the edges, the filmmaking is sharp.

The score combines scores from different movies, lifted to match the particular tone of the scene. In the climax, the James Bond theme plays—it works, but it's so recognizable.

My apologies for the mixed-up Hokkien and Mandarin renderings of the names. The movie is in Hokkien, but the info outside the movie I could find was in Mandarin. The movie doesn't say everyone's name, so I had to go off what I could find.

The film has a ton of setup to get through, but once things get going, it's pretty fun! It certainly contradicts <i>Film History: An Introduction</i>, which seems to believe that Taiwan only made propaganda and shlock before 1982.",taiwanplus.com,2025-02-13

Waldemar Rekowski steps out of his apartment with a couple of buckets. A rag drops from several stories above in front of him. He takes the rag to the trash room, where another tenant throws away old bread. A cat mews and Waldemar voices his distaste for cats. He takes his buckets to his taxi, turns on the radio, and cleans it. A young woman named Beata picks up a delivery, and Waldemar leers at her, offering her a ride somewhere. Meanwhile, a couple waits for his services. He drives off, ignoring the couple.

Jacek Łazar surveys a listing of movies showing at the theater. The camera is so close we can only make out his silhouette. When we cut to a wide shot of him, we do it through the theater's warped, dirty glass doors. When he approaches it, we see bars across the window and Jacek looking through them. He wanders the streets—he witnesses two men drag a third away into a room. Jacek gets to Castle Square, where he waits for a taxi, but sees a long line. He stands at the overpass over the highway as he waits. He sees a rock on the ledge, pushing it onto the road, causing an accident.

Piotr Balicki gives his final interview for his bar exam. They ask him why he wants to be a public defender, and he hesitates. When Piotr entered school, the answer was simple. Now, four years later, he isn't sure anymore. As to whether it gives his life meaning, the answer grows more unsure. His answers allow him to pass the exam, which sends him ecstatically riding through the city.

We follow our three characters as their lives overlap. Jacek will soon kill Waldemar. Piotr will have his first court case representing Jacek.

Each scene is rich with details that give us insights into these characters. Kieślowski is not content to showcase archetypes but flawed and complex characters with competing motivations. Waldemar is bitter, but deep within is a kindness he only shows to those closest to him. Jacek is traumatized by his sister's death, leaving him aimless and antipathetic. Both characters have a ""senseless malice"" to them, as Charles V. Eidsvik puts it in his 1990 review. As much as we get to know about them, we still do not understand their choices. 

Piotr is our least complex main character, as he argues the film's thesis, but he is no less compelling. He wants to know people he wouldn't otherwise meet and hopefully save their lives. He sees capital punishment not as a means of reprimanding the criminal but as a deterrent from others committing the same crime.  He cites Article 50 of the Poland Penal Code, which allows the courts to publish the sentence due to the ""social effect."" In other words, he finds it a questionable justification for cruel punishment.

Unlike the other episodes of Dekalog and A Short Film About Love, this movie has a yellow tint achieved with green filters, bold contrast, and strong silhouettes around the rim, narrowing our focus and obscuring the edges. Sometimes, the silhouette only lets through the main character onscreen—the other side of the film looks burnt away. Also, the film is shot with handheld cameras, getting us closer to the actions, as opposed to the stillness of the other Dekalogs.

I can't say these stylistic choices add much. They were cinematographer Slawomir Idziak's and not Kieślowski's. I like the handheld footage, but the filters and silhouettes feel arbitrary in places.

The film has almost no score. When it plays, it is dark and tense. Otherwise, the sounds of the city fill many scenes, creating a wall.

These features were present in Dekalog: Five, which focused on the commandment, ""Thou shalt not murder."" Here, Piotr's role is expanded, events are ordered differently, and more details about the arrest are provided. Most importantly, the film eliminates the voice-over from the episode, creating a more nuanced presentation of the events.

This film was released in 1988, the same year Poland finally suspended the death penalty. Some say this film is the reason, but I can't find definitive proof.

While the film lacks the aesthetic nuances of Kieślowski's best work, it's still a must-watch.","criterion channel, edited by women, birth year challenge, byc, łódź, solidarity",2025-02-14

Yang Mi-ja sits in the hospital waiting room with several others. She comes to the doctor regarding her arm feeling prickly. She struggles to find the word for it—she's been forgetting words lately. The doctor is more concerned about this than her arm—she's 66 and should see a specialist in Seoul. As she leaves the hospital, she passes a woman crying because her 16-year-old daughter has drowned from an apparent suicide.

On the way home,  Mi-ja sees a flyer about a poetry class at the cultural center. She comes home to find her 16-year-old grandson, Jong-wook, curled up on the bed, his music blaring throughout the apartment. Because they're in the same grade, Mi-ja asks her grandson about the girl who killed herself, but Jong-wook doesn't have much to say about her. Later that night, per the doctor's request, Mi-ja works her arm by playing badminton with Jong-wook outside. He soon stops when he receives a text and runs off to hang out with his friends. Mi-ja tries to stop him from going out so late, but he ignores her.

The next day, she attends the Cultural Center for the poetry class. The teacher tells them the most essential aspect of poetry is seeing—if you learn to see for the first time, words will come naturally. The assignment is to write one poem by the end of the month-long course.  Mi-ja takes notes about the things she sees, such as flowers. Soon, she sees more about her life than she realized.

If you've seen any Lee Chang-dong films, such as Burning, you know that his style is slow, letting details accumulate like sediment in a river. As a novelist, his movies have a patience that doesn't always feel immediately rewarding, but it makes sense when it all comes together.

Like many women actors, Yoon Jeong-hee had a prolific acting career from her twenties and thirties but found less work as she grew older. Her last movie before Poetry was in 1994. Poetry, her last film before retiring, won her the most acclaim. Her performance is graceful and nuanced, eliciting empathy with so little. Her character becomes enigmatic as we wonder what motivates some of her choices.

The film explores the surface way we see life versus the inner details that make it rich and complex. When we meet a stranger, we may find their sense of humor off-putting but learn of a tragedy in their past where humor is their coping mechanism. It doesn't forgive the humor but adds color to the understanding.

Nature, as a whole, has a sense of pure beauty—but when scaled down and surveyed, we find endless waves of suffering and pain that sustain the ecosystem. We don't have to love or participate in it, but it is a truth we cannot ignore when building our understanding of the world.

Perhaps then, we can genuinely appreciate beauty when we see it. Or it will swallow us into oblivion.

Lapland miners ascend the stairs, shutting off the lights as they go. They join other miners at the top of the stairs as one wires up a fuse and blows up the mine, shutting it down for good. Among the now out-of-work miners is Taisto Kasurinen, who takes off his gear and throws it away before hitting a cafe with an older coworker. The coworker gives Kasurinen the keys to his 1962 Cadillac convertible before walking into the men's room and shooting himself.

So, Kasurinen packs a suitcase, throws it in the back of the Cadillac, and hits the road. Kasurinen pulls all his money out of the bank. He can't get the convertible top to release, so he drives in the snow with the top down and a scarf wrapped around his head like a babushka. By night, he makes it to Southern Finland, where he stops to buy a burger. Two men see Kasurinen open his billfold and all the cash in it. So, they pretend to take an interest in his car, smash him over the head with a wine bottle, and take all his cash. When he awakens, he puts some paper on his head, wraps his head in a scarf, and hits the road.

The next day, Kasurinen arrives at a dock and waits with other men for daily work. While many men drive forklifts, Kasurinen loads sacks onto pallets for the forklifts to move. After his shift, he finds a coat in the trash that belonged to a worker who died in a forklift accident. He picks up his 256 marks and finds a homeless shelter to stay for the night. He takes his hard-earned cash to the bar and drinks himself under the table.

Irmeli gets off her shift as a hotel maid and changes clothes for her shift as a meter maid. She writes a ticket for Kasurinen's Cadillac as he's walking up. He asks how they can expedite the matter. She says dinner wouldn't hurt. So, he quits her job, and they drive off. What does the future hold for these two? Will Kasurinen's luck change, or is this the start of another tragedy to add to the books?

<blockquote><i>— Are you always this confident?
— No, this is the first time.</i></blockquote>

The film has such a sense of resignation. Terrible things happen, and Kasurinen moves on. The lack of affect and constant dogpiling are funny in its relentless tragedy. But I guess that's the point. The world has given up on Kasurinen—what can he do but continue? What can we do but laugh at his terrible luck?

The lack of non-diegetic music only heightens the ambiguity of how we're supposed to feel.

In the wilderness of the mountains, a father opens the camper to wake his son so they can go hunting. Darby Hinton plays the son. He played Cody in the classic Malibu Express! The son wants an opportunity to bond with his dad, but his dad wants to hunt. When his father isn't looking, the son removes the bullets from his gun. The father nearly shoots the kid in the head, But then spinning hairy jellyfish fly through the air like ninja stars and cling to the dad's face and body, sucking something out of him. When the son picks up his now-empty gun to shoot, it's too late. A spinning hairy jellyfish gets him, too.

Beth and Sandy meet up with Beth's boyfriend, Tom, and a boy named Greg, whom Beth and Tom are trying to set up with Sandy. Like every teenage journey in horror, they must stop for gas at a weird country gas station. A bobcat body hangs from the tree. They try to pay for gas and find the place cobwebbed and full of taxidermy. Jack Palance (Joe) comes out of the back, cranky as hell because there are teens in his gas station. The kids mention they're going to the lake, and Joe warns them in that affectless Jack Palance way. They claim they won't go. But you know they're gonna go.

Down at the lake, a cub scout group hikes around. The group leader stops and speaks about leading men like them into the wildness. He pulls out his compass to show its trustworthiness, but the needle is spinning erratically. He finds the father and son's camper. He looks around for them and finds the gun and one of the son's books. SPINNING HAIRY JELLYFISH to the back, and the scout leader is down. Meanwhile, the group sees a strange, tall shadow that scares them off.

 What is this humanoid creature? What are the spinning hairy jellyfish? Are our teens gonna make it?

Kevin Peter Hall plays the Humanoid and went on to play the Predator, as this movie influenced Predator.

The movie is about the disconnect between youth and adults who cannot figure them out.  From the adults, they feel like they've tried to prepare their kids for the world, but the world changes around them thanks to their fuckup Boomer kids. They try to warn the kids about danger, but they don't care—they'll do whatever they want.

The gore effects are pretty good! The victims have goopy, fucked up faces that look pretty gnarly. The spinning hairy jellyfish look silly, but I think they're neat.

The movie tries for character moments, but they don't do much to humanize these paper characters.

Christopher S. Nelson looks like Jeffrey Combs got stuck in an Osmond machine. I don't know what that means, but I think it makes sense. Anyway, he sucks. Tarah Nutter gets NOTHING to do other than smile and follow Nelson around.

Like <i>Uninvited</i>, the title is factually incorrect. Everyone in <i>Uninvited</i> was invited, and the teens went into the woods with ample warning. Also, like <i>Uninvited</i>, this has entertaining moments, but the thread in between leaves much to be desired.

In the summer of 1981, Brian Lackey, then 8 years old, lost five hours of his life. His sister, Deborah, found him in the closet wearing his Little League uniform, blood trickling out of his nose. He remembers that and standing on the roof with his sister and mother as a UFO passes over them.

In the summer of 1981, Neil McCormick, then 8 years old, came for the first time while watching his mom and her then-boyfriend, Alfred, hook up outside. When Neil's mom signed him up for Little League, Neil fell head over heels for his coach, who strongly resembled the men he'd seen in his mom's Playgirls and like Alfred. The coach also fell for Neil, as he became a star player, earning him a night alone with the Coach, eating pizza and playing video games. This leads to recording Neil's voice and taking photos of him. One night led to many more. This happened before the night he watched his mom and Alfred.

In October 1983, Neil met Wendy Peterson, who was one year older than him. They became the closest of friends. They torture a kid by putting firecrackers in his mouth and lighting them. When the shards embedded in the kid's face, Neil jerked the boy off, just like Coach had shown him. Brian lost his glasses and got lost in the woods, where a mysterious figure approached him, triggering his nosebleeds. He awoke an hour later, unsure but convinced that this moment was connected to the one from two years ago. Brian needed to figure out what had happened. He believes his answer may be in the stars and among extraterrestrials.

The film follows Neil, Brian, and Wendy into their teens and all the tiny tragedies that come with it.

Shoegaze showers and drowns us throughout, pulsing and gushing like an open wound. The surreal becomes not just an uncanny experience but a very real one in which a character shifts, rationalizes, or misunderstands.

I'm happy I read about how they filmed the grooming and child abuse to protect the kids. They filmed a lot of scenes with characters facing the camera, and the kids were never in the same room when the adults said the fucked up stuff. The staring into the camera becomes a motif.

The transitions fade to black or the quickest crossfade, creating the sense of lost or disoriented time.

Men like Neil and Brian's coach really fuck up a kid's sense of what is safe touch and what isn't. It becomes hard to trust an innocent hug from their father or even say goodbye to a friend. What is soothing and what is sexual is all bundled up, making intimacy and authenticity challenging to present, let alone parse. How do you learn who you can trust?

Lest you think this is a bleak drama, this is Gregg Araki we're talking about. His sense of humor comes through in classically unusual ways. The film has a deep empathy for its characters, and while it isn't afraid to break our hearts, it isn't trying to torture us. He's giving some of us that meaningful reminder that we're not the only ones with fucked up childhoods—that other people also spent too much of their life waiting for someone else's ship to land.

Everyone is sooo good in this! I am always happy to see Michelle Trachtenberg and Mary Lynn Rajskub. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is at his all-time peak here. Jeffrey Licon is so adorable.

I love Brian and Eric's friendship!!

In 1853, Solomon Northrup told his story to David Wilson about how Northrup, a black man born free in NY, was tricked into going to DC, where he was kidnapped and sold into slavery in Louisiana. There, he was in bondage for 12 years before being able to reach out to friends in NY, who secured Northrup's release with the aid of the state. The book is vital in building a picture of what slavery looks like in the United States.

Per Steve McQueen's request, John Ridley wrote a screenplay adapting the memoir that became this film. Having history and screenwriting experience, Ridley had the opportunity to expand Northrup's work and bring into focus the institution of chattel slavery and the systems that upheld it. Instead, Ridley used Northrup's horrific experiences as background fodder for a ""romance"" between white enslaver Edwin Epps and enslaved woman Patsey, as much as you can call their dynamic a ""romance."" The film also invents scenarios out of whole cloth to instill further how ""real"" slavery was.

This latter effort has received the most praise in Steve McQueen's film. I use ""real"" in quotations because the film seems only concerned with the what, not the why. In the process, it implies that racism was only a problem in the South and that the South was an intrinsically evil force that did not represent the US as a whole. Though unintentional, the film also suggests that Northrup did not belong in slavery while those he saw around him did.

The film ignores the systems at play that not only perpetuated slavery then but do so now through the carceral system and the racism intrinsic to the institutions that uphold it. It reduces the system of oppression to the sadism of individuals, which grants a collective burden lifted from white people's shoulders. I believe this is why so many white filmgoers have championed this movie: because it showcases the horror of slavery without insinuating they have any role in its aftermath.

Jane Birkin saw Agnès Varda's movie Vagabond. Afterward, Birkin wrote Varda. Varda couldn't read Birkin's terrible handwriting, so Birkin met Varda in person to decipher it. They talked about their children. While walking in the park one Sunday, Birkin lamented turning 40 soon. Varda said, ""Don't be silly. It's a wonderful age. Perfect time to do your portrait."" 

They intended to counter the tributes to deceased actresses by showing clips from their old movies and interviews. This film will have clips from non-existent movies and fabricated interviews.

<blockquote><i>We played with the false to get at the real. We were in it together, the woman filming and the one being filmed, like painter and model.</i></blockquote>

The resulting film is one of the most personal documentaries I've seen. The artifice is present in every shot, whether it be Birkin talking to the camera or the camera in the shot with Birkin. Varda gives herself the role of camera, showing up to explain the rules. The camera captures every wrinkle and pore so lovingly.

The credits present several examples of traditional Georgian dance before introducing us to Merab, a Georgian dancer training at the National Georgian Ensemble. He performs a sequence with Mary. The teacher, Aleko, stops Mereb from being too soft in his movements and critiques Mary for letting her eyes wander instead of the stoic stare at the floor, which conveys purity. In other words, remove all sexiness from the dance. Then, Irakli, a replacement dancer with a glib attitude, interrupts rehearsal. Still, Aleko has him step in for Mereb and shows himself to have the traits that Merib lacked. 

Merab and Mary also work part-time waiting jobs. Merab helps his mother pay bills with his earnings. That night, he brings some leftovers from work home. His Nona chastises him for accepting the handout like he's poor. Merab's mother wakes up to join them at the dinner table, asking about Merab's brother, David, whom neither has seen lately. David shows up the following morning, hungover and exhausted, just in time to go to class.

Ioseb, Merab's father, used to be a dance ensemble member. The director brings it up when he stops by the class for an unexpected visit. He grills Merab on Georgian dance, reminding him that dance is the very spirit of Georgia. The class learns that the ensemble is holding auditions. In the women's locker room, Mary discovers that Zaza, the dancer they need to replace, was beaten severely when a group of men caught him having sex with another man. Meanwhile, in the men's locker room, Irakli stirs the ire of the other boys, including Merab.

The film follows Merab as he navigates his family's financial problems and dance training, all while navigating the complexities Irakli introduces into his life, especially when both audition for the ensemble position. 

The film takes place in Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia, which has a 95% Christian population and a profoundly conservative bent. The plot is rather conventional in its exploration of queer longing. It gains its power by exploring it in such a repressed state. The film received numerous cancellations and protests from conservative groups, leading to several screenings having mobilized police troops guarding them.

The film explores tradition vs. individualism. The National Georgian Ensemble is an inherently traditional establishment. The dancing has no room for individual interpretation or any dance that does not convey conventional gender roles. Moreover, the traditional dances used to be softer, but around 50 years ago, they hardened the moves to further emphasize ""strength"" in dance. Merab has been dancing since childhood but finds it difficult to conform to the precise movements. Throughout the film, Merab discovers feelings for Irakli and that he may be gay— through this journey, he develops a dance language of his own that communicates what he doesn't know how to say. This individual form of expression directly contrasts with the rigidity of traditional Georgian dance.

Levan Gelbakhiani, who plays Merab, looks like an attractive Ethan Slater. His performance is so sweet. Bachi Valishvili, who plays Irakli, can get it.

Georgian cursing hits hard! I gotta learn some so I can hack in someone's face while calling them a bastard.

The scene with Robyn's <i>Honey</i> lives up to the hype. Also, I wish they hadn't cut so much in that final dance scene, but that dance goes hard.

It's WWII, and the Nazi party has established a military occupation and control in northern and western France. Marie lies in Cherbourg and gathers food with her two children: her young son Pierrot and little Mouche in her arms. Pierrot cries at the prospect of eating what they have. They walk the empty streets of their town to their flat. At the flat, their neighbor Ginette kisses her husband, Bernard, before he ships to Germany. Bernard is going off to save prisoners of war—maybe he will find Marie's husband, Paul. Pierrot asks if his mother was happy when he was born. She tells him, of course, because having a boy is always correct.

Marie dances and drinks with her friend Rachel at a cafe that night—the men in the cafe watch with half-drunken smiles. The owner shuts them down at the prospect of Krauts coming by and seeing them. Marie and Rachel walk the streets, Marie singing and dreaming of one day singing on stage. She stops by Ginette's to pick up her coffee mill when she comes home. She finds her sitting in a bath of mustard to try and induce a miscarriage. Marie tells her it won't work.

The following day, Marie sends her kids out to play in the torrential rain, demanding they don't return until lunch. Ginette brings the supplies that Marie requested. Marie cuts the soap into the boiling water before letting it cool on the sill. They move the table so Ginette can lie on the floor. Marie pulls the cooled water into a hand pump with a spigot, working one end into Ginette and pumping. Marie asks if she can keep the leftover soap.

A couple of days later, Ginette miscarries. She gifts Marie a record player. Word spreads about Marie's skills as a faiseuse d'anges (female maker of angels). The film follows Marie as she helps other women and herself, especially as her husband returns and she loses her feelings for him. One woman, a prostitute named Lulu, plays a central role in her new life.

<blockquote><i>— I've been a slave since I was 14. And I don't see how it'll ever change.
— Like most women.</i></blockquote>

The film uses the real-life story of Marie-Louise Giraud to explore women's roles in a repressed society. Pregnant caretaker or sex worker, they receive nothing but disdain if they're not fucking or keeping the house afloat. Marie has the opportunity to live a male power fantasy — she has her lover, her illegal business, and a long line of people to keep quiet.

<blockquote><i>Six in seven years of marriage—having a bloated body nine months a year for six years. And always a starving little one hanging at my breast. I feel like a cow. I hate myself. </i></blockquote>

The film has biopic energy in a way I find hard to ignore. But Isabelle Huppert is incredible, and the story is captivating. The story handles its bleak subject matter with such precision, never moralizing the behavior you see, only speaking about the character's actions and their consequences.

<blockquote><i>— Do you think babies in their mother's belly have a soul?
— Their mothers would have to have one first.</i></blockquote>

Though I detest the biopic formula, this is a person worth making one about. Somehow, this subject is still in contest in the USA.

But shouldn't that be a choice and not a last option?

We open in the year 1621, after the first Thanksgiving. A nipple fills the screen. We zoom out to a pilgrim woman hiding behind a tree. And yes, her breasts are out. She breaks into a run, chased by something with purple Predator vision. She trips on a rock. When she looks up, she sees Turkie, a talking turkey wielding a tomahawk, who says, ""Nice tits, bitch,"" before killing her.

Cut to the present day, on the Loyola Marymount University campus. Billy runs out of a building and rips his shirt, exhilarated to be on Thanksgiving break. Johnny walks out behind him and shakes his head with a smile — classic Billy. Ali sees and wishes to join in, so she lifts her shirt to show off her bra. Kristen shames her, saying, ""It's Thanksgiving, not Titsgiving."" Darren runs up to join the group. Johnny tries to give him a high five, but Darren reaches for a handshake. The five college students pile into Johnny's Jeep to head home for the holiday.

Meanwhile, Oscar lets his dog out to pee. The dog finds a totem pole to pee on, waking Turkie, who kills the dog. The college student's Jeep breaks down, so they camp in Crawberg for the night. Darren recognizes the town name and tells us how Turkie came to be.

Will these kids survive Turkie's wrath? Or will they figure out a way to stop him in time? Do you care?

Look, this is a $3500 student film, with only porn star Wanda Lust getting paid to be in it. Everyone else is a friend or family member of the filmmakers. The script riffs on holiday slasher conventions, if you could call this riffing.

The lack of real actors sometimes makes the cutaways funny, as we'll see someone with a dead face waiting for their turn to speak.

Overall, this movie isn't funny. It suffers from 2008's tolerance of every slur except the n-word, which is often The Joke. But every once in a while, it pulled a laugh out of me, intentionally or otherwise.","tubi, anti-criterion challenge 2024, acc2024, nature attacks",2025-02-20

A girl in a glowing white dress jumps rope while counting each star and giving its name. In the foreground, a bird of prey hangs from a gibbet. The girl's jump rope and the bird's eyes glow at night. A drunk couple ambles past her as she counts. The Southwold Lighthouse spins its guiding light. She gets to one hundred and stops.

<blockquote><i>Once you've counted to 100, all the other hundreds are the same.</i></blockquote>

We meet the drunk couple as the man pours her a bath. They strip down, and the woman screams in delight, running out into the night to get her bath. Cissie, the man's wife, arrives on the scene and holds her husband's head underwater. He drowns and dies.

Throughout the film, we meet three married women named Cissie Colpitts. We follow their story as each woman drowns her husband, and the coroner covers up for them.

The movie introduces a conceit in which the numbers 1 to 100 appear throughout the film—if you've seen the <i>How I Met Your Mother</i> episode, you understand immediately.

Each scene has a dense composition of elements, like a classical painting. You can pause the movie at nearly any point and see painterly images. Often, they feel like scenes from an I Spy book, where the filmmakers have carefully arranged objects and characters. In that sense, it also reminds me of Wes Anderson's fussier films.

There's an inherent Britishness to this movie that prevents me from fully understanding it. While playful and absurd, I found it difficult to care about much. So much of the film is Smut giving rules to non-existent games, and the repetition, while thematic, is tiresome.

The film is, in fact, two: Distant Voices and Still Lives. They were shot two years apart but with the same cast and crew.

<b>Distant Voices</b>
Mother brings in the milk from outside. She calls for Eileen, Tony, and Maisie to come down. We watch the stairs, hear the footsteps, and hear the voices, but we do not see the children coming down. They take a photo together, dressed in black, coming home from her husband's funeral. We experience their memories of their father and the violence he brought into each of their lives.

<b>Still Lives</b>
Years later, the children we have met are now adults. Everyone has married, some have kids, and none are happy with the choices they've made in their life.

The film is about the lingering effects of domestic violence on those who survive it.

Terence Davies' films have a curious feel that never feels unmotivated but isn't always opaque. Some moments are poses for pictures, but the camera pulls in. In the background is a photo of Davies' father.

The film's performances have stage acting vibes — broad movement and no energy given to microexpressions. It was hard to get used to, but I eventually adapted.

There are so many singing moments—drunk, mourning, hiding, loving—there's a song for every moment. Memories get attached to songs, and hearing them can take us back to that place—which is not always where we want to be.

Weirdly, this is a case similar to <a href=""https://boxd.it/8TXNkh"">Drowning by Numbers</a>, where the Britishness makes the film harder for me to connect to.

The greyback cane beetle is a native Australian beetle. It lays its eggs in the soil, and its larvae hatch and feed on sugarcane roots, killing or stunting the plant's growth. In adulthood, the beetles eat the leaves of the sugarcane. Sugar was one of Australia's major exports, so these beetles threatened the economy.

In the 1920s, Puerto Rican farmers used the cane toad as a successful pest control. Entomologist Raquel Dexter wrote a research paper in 1932 that demonstrated this effect, which led to American entomologist Cyril Pemberton introducing the cane toad to Hawaii in the early 1930s.

On June 22nd, 1935, Australia imported 102 cane toads from Hawaii to Gordonvale. Within two years, they had multiplied to around 62 thousand. As of 2011, their population was at over 200 million. While the cane toad adapted to their new surroundings, an obvious problem with this solution arose: the beetle could fly, and the toads could not. So far, we have no substantial proof that the cane toad has affected the cane beetle population in Australia.

In 1945, Australia introduced the pesticide Gammexane, which finally killed the cane grub and beetle. However, the cane toad remained.

The documentary interviews farmers, experts, and residents to understand the situation. It does so primarily from the perspective of the cane toad.

To create the effect of looking up from a cane toad's point of view, DP Jim Frazier developed a set of lenses that created the appearance of a massive depth of field, allowing foreground and background images to be in focus. Panavision picked up the lenses and sold them as Frazier lenses. They're still widely used in Hollywood films and nature documentaries.

Though the film talks about people who regularly kill cane toads, director Mark Lewis made sure to avoid killing any toads. Of course, we see dead cane toads, and we watch cane toads eat all sorts of weird shit. They'll eat ANYTHING smaller than them, including other toads, which has been an ecological disaster for Australia.

<blockquote><i>Love is the genesis of everything.</i></blockquote>Bugs looks through the code and finds a Modal. She enters and sees a scene reminiscent of the beginning of The Matrix, but it's different. The agents spot Bugs, and she runs, only to be pulled aside by one of them. They realize they are in Thomas Anderson's apartment. The Agent goes over his awakening and realizes that he is Morpheus and has to find Neo.

<blockquote><i>The choice is an illusion. You already know what you have to do.</i></blockquote>Thomas Anderson works at Deus Machina on a game called Binary. On his desk is a Game Award for The Matrix, a game trilogy he developed in 1999. He still has a monitor running old Matrix code, running a Modal experiment. Modal is how Anderson develops game characters. It's throwing an error he doesn't understand. At Simulatte, a cafe Anderson frequents, he sees Tiffany, a married mother on whom he based the Trinity character. His coworker Jude tries to get them talking. When Tiffany and Anderson shake hands, they have a sense that they've met before.

<blockquote><i>We can't see it, but we're all trapped in these same repeating loops.</i></blockquote>Anderson's boss calls him up. He's one of the Agents we saw in the Modal. His boss is worried about Anderson and wants to ensure he continues his therapy. Anderson experiences ""episodes"" in which he cannot distinguish between reality and dreams. Warner Bros. is making a sequel to The Matrix with or without Deus Machina. The experience rattles Anderson, and he discusses it with his psychoanalyst. The psychoanalyst reassures Anderson and refills his medication prescription, little blue pills. Anderson swallows one. In his reflection, we see a balding older man, but that isn't what Anderson sees.

<blockquote><i>I know you said the story was over for you. But that's the thing about stories—they're never really over, are they?</i></blockquote>Will Neo be able to escape The Matrix again? Will Bugs and Morpheus find him? Why did the machines go to such lengths to keep Neo alive and hide him?

The rumor train spoiled this movie for a lot of folks. Most notably, people believe that Lana Wachowski made this movie at gunpoint, afraid of letting anyone else touch the project. This theory contradicts The Matrix's history, as The Animatrix was primarily other people touching the project and the subsequent video games. Yes, Warner Bros. was entertaining treatments written by others in hopes of making a reboot, but the studio wanted the Wachowski's blessing. Yes, Warner Bros. constantly approached the Wachowskis, asking them to make another Matrix movie, but they had declined until 2019, when their parents died, as well as a close friend of Lana's. This script was her way of processing that grief—by bringing back Neo and Trinity, she could experience a rebirth impossible in the real world. For Lilly, revisiting these characters seemed like the opposite of what she needed in this time of grief. Yes, the film lambasts the idea of revisiting The Matrix, making several jokes about the nature of reboot culture in Hollywood. And yet, here the film is.

The special effects look awful. For a movie worth $190 million, this is a step back from where The Matrix was. I can give a canon reason why that would be the case, but the fact remains.

Folks are upset that the movie abandoned martial arts in favor of the Heroic Bloodshed style, which was always present in the movies but not the sole means of fighting. I think the problem is that the fight choreography isn't that good. Again, this is a step back for the series. We get a recreation of the kung fu scene from The Matrix, and it tells us everything we need—the actors aren't up to the task.

But I don't care <b>that</b> much about effects and choreo. I care about the story. And the story is Lilly's chance to make what was implicit in The Matrix explicit. In 1999, she was still an egg. While trans people recognized the prominent themes present in The Matrix, the vast majority of audiences saw yet another Gen X ""escape the capitalist system"" narrative. Which it was, too, but it wasn't <b>only</b> that. The film discusses people's perspective on what the movie ""is"" as though it was only one thing—hence, the red pill subreddit and so many fragile male egos sopping up the opposite message.

<blockquote><i>They took your story, something that meant so much to me, and turned it into something trivial. That's what the Matrix does. It weaponizes every idea, every dream—everything that's important to us.</i></blockquote>That's the lesson this movie hits us with—it's not a binary. Few things ever are, even choices. Because choice is an illusion when you know what the right choice is.

<blockquote><i>I remember wanting a family, but was that because that's what women are supposed to want? How do you know if you want something yourself or if your upbringing programmed you to want it?</i></blockquote>So many have lived their transition not in the real world but through games like Second Life and other MMOs. But as more and more of those spaces go dormant, so too does the life sublimated. The detransition back to the world is painful and all too common. So, the film also says to them, ""It's not too late to try again.""

We didn't have to revisit The Matrix—or maybe we did. It doesn't live up to the original experience—it never could. Regardless, this is probably the best way we could have returned to this world.

The Facade Band's Say the Word plays as we watch Sam Nash, Independent Voice reporter, take photos of all the college activities at the University of Miami. He runs into Lauren Daly, instantly falls in love, and helps her avoid getting her red Chrysler Le Baron towed.

After some hijinx, the notorious Frank Duffy, a fellow school reporter, asks Sam about breaking into Dr. Ethridge's office to see what he's doing to those poor monkeys, but Sam's too scared. And what is he doing? The movie tells us that he's injecting baboon brains with a serum that theoretically revitalizes dead blood cells. Except oops! This stuff actually makes the baboon rage out. 

Since Sam won't break in, Duffy does, and he catches pictures of the baboon, only to accidentally let it out. The baboon bites him, then runs out into the street to instantly die from a head-on collision.

Sam and Duffy go on a double date with Lauren and Lauren's new brilliant roommate, Debbie Gilbert. Sam and Lauren hit it off. So does Duffy and Debbie. That is until he gets violent with her and bites her. When Duffy goes to the school doctor, his wait is too long, so he rages out and destroys the place.

Uh oh! Looks like Duffy's got a case of Primal Rage™️.

So explains Helga to her eight-year-old grandson Luke, who is visiting from America on vacation, as she makes candles. When Luke asks if the witches hunted Helga, she shows him the missing pinky on her left hand. Helga has tried to find The Grand High Witch, who rules over all other witches, but believes no one has seen her. Helga describes what happened to her childhood friend—how a witch stalked her and trapped her in a painting until she died. That's how witches kill—not by conventional means like weapons, but through curses that hide them in plain sight.

One day, the police come to Helga's door to inform her that Luke's parents were killed in a car accident, making Helga Luke's legal guardian. They move to England, where Luke starts school. There, he uses the knowledge of witches Helga gave him to avoid a witch who attempts to seduce him with snakes and chocolate, two things little boys love.

For Luke's ninth birthday, Helga gives him some mice, which Luke names William and Mary. But Helga falls ill, and her doctor suggests rest and a summer by the sea. So they pack up and head to Hotel Excelsior in Bournemouth. Little do they know that the hotel is also hosting the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, a covert convention for witches. And who else is attending but The Grand High Witch herself?

What do these witches have in store? Will Luke and Helga be able to stop them? 

Based on the Roald Dahl book of the same name, this was the last film based on Dahl's material before his death. Dahl was vocally incensed about the movie, specifically how it changed the original ending—I'll avoid more details and spoilers.

This film was the last that Jim Henson worked on before his death. Jim Henson's Creature Shop provided prosthetics for the witches and animatronics. The prosthetics will look familiar to Henson and/or <i>Dark Crystal</i> fans because they are total nightmare fuel.

Anjelica Huston has so much fun with this role. I don't know what accent she's going for, but she never sticks to it anyway.

Rowan Atkinson is perfect as the uptight hotel manager. I imagine his performance inspired Tim Curry's in <i>Home Alone 2</i>.

Two teens sit in a rowboat. The boyfriend is grumpy and fishing, while the girlfriend is bored AF. So, she decides to strip down and swim in the lake despite seeing sewage dumped into it. But just before she takes off her top, the boyfriend feels something slimy on his bare feet, and something pulls him into the lake.

By the way, even though the girlfriend calls him Wayne, he's credited as Boy in Boat. I wish my one IMDb credit were ""Girl in Boat."" Where was I? Oh, right. Boy comes up as a rush of pulpy blood, triggering the S-tier credits sequence. It's slugs but inverted and blue. Random screams are thrown into the score because the filmmakers aren't sure if they are conveying how scary this movie will otherwise be.

<i>SLUGS</i>

When the credits end, we see Ron Bell, drunk as a skunk, walking in the street at night. A car full of teens harasses him as they pass, sending him to the ground. Ron Bell eats the fuck out of the scenery when his dog sidles over and helps him up. His dog squeals as he nips the bottle in his jacket. His one beloved dog becomes his mortal enemy as it keeps squealing, making Ron angry. He sits on the couch, and I guess his house has a bunch of slugs. So the slugs eat him.

<i>SLUGS</i>

Mike Brady and his wife, Kim, are on a double date with Maureen and her husband, David. Maureen wants to dance, but everyone else is far too straight and white to pretend they can dance. So Mike and Kim leave, only to run into Don Palmer and his wife, Maria. Don's the county sanitation supervisor. Don tries to get Mike to stay for a drink, but Mike's gotta get home for his early meeting with the sheriff tomorrow, where they go by Ron Bell's house and evict Ron Bell.

That night, Kim puts on black lingerie and asks Mike if he finds Maureen attractive. Because Kim is a teacher, Mike uses the epic pickup line, ""Say, teacher, what do you say we start our homework?"" Just those words send Maureen into orgasmic bliss. Meanwhile, slugs crawl on their window.

<i>SLUGS</i>

Thankfully, the movie fulfills the promise of letting us see Mike drive to the sheriff's office to meet up with the sheriff and head over to Ron Bell's house to evict him. An officer receives a call from his wife, and the officer laughs at his wife, saying he won't come home to kill a couple of snails. His wife corrects him. He says, ""Snails? Slugs? What's the difference?""

<i>SLUGS</i>

Mike and the sheriff jump into the car. Brady tries to light a cigarette — what a rebel—and the sheriff stops Mike from messing up his lungs. Oh my god, finally, they got to Ron Bell's house. Funny, he isn't answering his door. Notorious town drunk we're about to evict Ron Bell always answers his door! Could it be the slugs we saw 10 minutes ago? They find Bell's skeleton, covered in viscera and crawling with slugs.

<i>SLUGS</i>

Mike has to go back in and see what's up. Which I guess means pointing his flashlight at a shit-stained toilet for at least 15 seconds. After that, however, we see the streaks of goo running down the hallway in formation. Some zig-zag. Some terminate, suggesting the slug evaporated mid-stride. Mike follows the trail down to the basement. His first horror is the amount of trash Ron kept down there. You could breed slugs in that sort of compost!

<i>SLUGS

Mike tells the sheriff he thinks rats killed Ron. The sheriff rightfully treats Mike like an idiot. Because it ain't rats, Mike, It's

<i><b>SLUGS</i></b>.

Actually it's BIG SLUGS, but the movie doesn't establish that until 25 minutes and three deaths later.

This movie is so fucking good. Every choice is inspired. I didn't mean to summarize it in that much detail. Don't worry. That's just the first ten minutes of this movie. I had to stop myself from pausing and writing another paragraph.

It is based on the novel Slugs by Shaun Hutson. Weirdly, the book is about a baseball player who gets recruited into the army, so Slugs takes on a double meaning: the hits he makes while playing baseball and the falling bullets as he shoots his fellow man in the name of freedom. It reflects on the morality of war vs. the price of liberty.

Actually, that's not true; they are the same slugs as in this movie.

If there's a double meaning anywhere, it's in the film's no-so-covert condemnation of drinking. Our hero evades it with wuxia-like dexterity TWICE at the bar with friends. The two known alcoholics in the movie are marked for death: Ron Bell, immediately, and Maureen Watson. One of the teens, who looks at least thirty-five, stops initiating sex with his girlfriend to drink Captain Morgan. It makes their behavior sluggish, so the slugs consume them. It also punishes those who are reticent to do chores—might as well be a drunk, as useless as you are to the economy.

Mike has uglier Ted Danson energy. I'm not saying Ted Danson is ugly; you could mash your fingers into his face like Play-Doh and get this guy's face.

The gore effects, while cheap, are copious.

The strength of these slugs! I didn't realize they could combine their strength and pull an adult human around.

The film understands the inherent eroticism of slugs. I need to rewatch <i>Pieces</i>—I think I misunderstood it the first time.

In her dreams, Anna visits the house, asking for help. A boy comes to the window and tells her not to come in—it's dangerous around here. Anna awakens with a fever and is drenched in sweat. She adds more and more details to the house.

The film follows the progress of Anna's relationship with this boy and the real-world consequences of what Anna draws.

The film sometimes feels like Terry Gilliam, but it arrives at a more maudlin story than expected. It has the most literal depictions of ""fever dreams"" in a movie.

Hans Zimmer's score is bombastic but effective! It hit in a couple of scenes—I was not prepared!

<blockquote><i>Most things in life, good and bad, just happen to you.</i></blockquote>

Brian Flanagan, a recently discharged army member, gets a ride from his fellow soldiers to catch a bus to New York City, his hometown. He reads a book titled How to Turn Your Idea into a Million Dollars, hoping to learn the secrets held in this mass-market trade paperback. Brian arrives at Pat's Place, run by his Uncle Pat, and Brian immediately starts critiquing the place. Pat asks about Brian's plans, and Brian leaves it vague, ""Make a million,"" so Brian says he'll work with McDougal to get Brian a job, just like Brian's father. But Brian refuses to become his father.

Brian heads to Wall Street to get a high-powered business job. He talks about his drive and how he reads the Journal. But without that college degree, Brian's going to get bupkis. He passes a bar looking for help, where he meets Doug Coughlin. Brian assumes the job will be simple. Doug allows him to learn otherwise. Brian pulls off his sweat-drenched socks at the night's end, feeling defeated. But Doug gives him the gig.

While bartending, Brian starts business school to get that coveted college degree. The economics go over Brian's head, but the bartending flairs come like second nature. And just like that, Brian is crushing it. But all the late nights are leaving him falling asleep in class. But Doug has dreams of his own—maybe they can make them happen together in Jamaica.

Or maybe this movie will turn into a cucking contest.

Heywood Gould wrote a semi-autobiographical novel about his experiences bartending in New York. The book focuses on an older guy who started bartending when he was younger. As the years went on, he kept bartending and felt like his life was passing him by.

Gould wrote the screenplay that would become this movie, going through several changes. First, when Universal picked it up, they wanted a more likable protagonist. Then, when Disney took over, they wanted a younger protagonist. Finally, when Tom Cruise got the lead role, the script had to change further to protect his image, taking away most of the bite of the original novel. It makes sense why Gould directed what he wrote from this movie on.

 So, instead of the Paul Schrader-esque character study of the novel, we get a fluffy, misogynist blip of a movie. The film is such a bizarre fantasy where being a bartender is the single sexiest thing you can do as a human. Then again, look like young Tom Cruise, and it may be true.

Bryan Brown is a good actor who brings massive energy to the role. Tom Cruise has a charming smile and energy but no character to work off of. Gina Gershon brought her ability to meld into any tone, just like she later did in <i>Showgirls</i>.

However, this movie's worst contribution to culture was the song Kokomo by The Beach Boys. That song was everywhere in my childhood, including in my head. It's a good day when I don't have to hear that song. Oh my god, this soundtrack sucks.

There are worse ways to spend your time than watching hot people make out and simulate sex in exotic locales. But nearly 2 hours of it with such unlikeable characters tests anyone's patience.","birth year challenge, byc",2025-02-24

<blockquote><i>One does not create by adding but by taking away.</i> — Robert Bresson</blockquote>

This film is an anthology of seven segments from seven directors. Some are documentaries, some fiction, all touching on the COVID-19 quarantine lockdown. 


<b>Jafar Panahi — Tehran, Iran **.5</b>
The Panahi family's pet iguana watches a pigeon outside. It longs to eat the bird's eggs. Jafar's mother-in-law comes over, dressed head-to-toe in protective clothing. The documentary focuses on the mother-in-law's concern about coronavirus. It compares the mannerisms of the iguana and the mother, both aging and in need of regular care.


<b>Anthony Chin — Tongzhou, China ***.5</b>
A man squats on the floor of his kitchen, watching his wife hold their crying son. The woman's father calls and FaceTimes with them, lamenting that they haven't come to see him, but they'll do it once this virus blows over. They watch the Chinese New Year from their window. The short follows the couple as quarantine tests their relationship.

Girl, leave this manchild. Is their kid named 小号??


<b>Malik Vitthal — California, USA ***.5</b>
Bobby Yay Yay is trying to get back his kids while continuing his job working with troubled youth. His three children live in three different foster homes after a poorly handled divorce. All this while the quarantine is underway.

The short combines footage from phone and Skype calls with animation to convey abstractly what the footage cannot capture, such as Bobby's state of mind.


<b>Laura Poitras (with Forensic Architecture) — New York City, USA ***</b>
One month into lockdown, Forensic Architecture asked Laura Poitras to join them in investigating NSO Group, an Israeli cyberweapons manufacturer. The doc uses voice memos, recorded Skype calls, and footage from Poitras's apartment and outside her windows.

I love that you can see Nan Goldin's photos on Poitras' wall. She also worked on the Nan Goldin documentary All the Beauty and the Bloodshed. This one is terrifying but really dense.


<b>Dominga Sotomayor — Santiago, Chile ***.5</b>
A woman works in her greenhouse. She receives a text. She puts on her headphones and records herself singing in the bathroom. She gets a call about one of her daughters. So, she locks up the house and walks to a remote location where she finds her daughter trying to pitch a tent. The daughter could have the police had caught her breaking quarantine. The short follows the mother and daughter's cohabitation and their effort to see the other daughter's newborn child.


<b>David Lowery — Texas, USA ***</b>
A woman digs through a storage unit. She grabs an unopened can of seltzer, taps the piano, and finds a box of letters. She returns the letters to her car, drinks the seltzer, and goes through the letters. The first one is post dated Feb 22, 1926. A gunshot interrupts her letter reading, sending her driving off. Through the letters, the woman finds directions to a grave where the letter writer buried his son.

<blockquote><i>There is no shortage of ugliness in the world. There would have been more ugliness if man had closed his eyes to it. But man is a problem solver.

We open on a woman affected by Hansen's disease, or as it's colloquially known leprosy. She was one of several people with the disease who were kept in the Bababaghi Hospice leper colony. A child reads from the Qur'an a passage thanking God for creating him.

Forough Farrokhzah was a poet and film director. This film was the only one she made before her death in 1967. After making this film, she adopted one of the children named Hossein.

Critics considered this film the forerunner to the Iranian New Wave. The film resembles Italian neorealism in its unwavering depiction of people affected by Hansen's. But it has a poetic quality that surpasses neorealism's grounded objectives. It doesn't just ask you to look at these people's suffering—it conveys their joys, humanity, and faith despite everything.

The science of the film is out of date in a number of ways. Most importantly, the disease is not as contagious as common knowledge suggests. When this movie was made, the disease had become resistant to all known treatments. As of 1982, we have a cure for the disease but have not eradicated it completely.

Red bell peppers line the balcony on a humid summer day at the country estate of La Mangdrádora. Outside, Mecha, Gregorio, and friends sunbathe around the pool. Mecha's shaking hand fills her wine glass with a stained bottle of cabernet sauvignon and a handful of ice. Mecha's drink rings with the clanging ice. All at once, the bodies stand, dragging their chairs to another spot to better catch the sun. Mecha's daughters, Momi and Verónica, lounge in bed to escape the heat. Momi offers a whispered prayer to God, thanking him for Isabel, one of Mecha's Amerindian servants. She goes to lie with the napping Verónica, tears in her eyes because Mecha plans to fire Isabel, who is supposedly stealing towels and sheets.

Gunshots ring out from a hunting expedition in the nearby hills led by Joaquín. Mecha stumbles around, collecting everyone's wine glasses. She collapses, breaking the glasses. Gregorio checks on Mecha, who claims she is fine, so he grabs another glass of wine. Isabel and Momi run outside to help her up. Blood covers Mecha's chest from glass cuts. Momi carefully pulls shards of glass from Mecha's chest while Isabel grabs towels to help sop up the blood. The rain starts, and one of the daughters, too young to drive, must drive Mecha to the doctor, as Mecha refuses to let Isabel drive her anywhere.

Tali, Mecha's cousin, talks on the phone about all the travel she cannot do—her husband, Rafael, is busy with work, and she has the kids to look after. Well, they have the hired help, Agustina. Her son, Luciano, comes inside to play with the dead hare on the table. Two girls run in, drenched from water balloons outside. Luciano jumps on the counter, his leg now bleeding, trying to clean the blood off in the sink.  Tali rushes Luciano to the doctor, learning of Mecha's condition—stomach pumped and tranquilized. Gregorio was so drunk he couldn't give blood. The doctor provides Luciano with some stitches, but he's otherwise fine. While Mecha is recovering, Tali and Luciano join all the convening family members at La Mandrágora. Meanwhile, a news report comes in about locals seeing apparitions of the Virgin Mary.

The film follows the family for the rest of the week.

I started watching this movie several months ago with someone I was seeing. We had intended to finish it, but we broke up before we could. So, the film has an extratextual pain associated with it. I mention that only to remind myself why I tagged them.

This movie is chaos. The camera trembles with the drunks and races with the runners—all the children calling for attention to their crises of the moment. Things happen—not illogically, but suddenly, and the direction of the scene changes. The cinematography is a lesson on conveying male leering without overtly casting a male gaze. It's also a game of I Spy, where scenes are cut away before they are complete. In the following scene, we see the effects of the previous scene only once the camera moves. It's all disorienting, but that feels intentional.

Lucrecia Martel based her screenplay on her childhood experiences but took them to unusual places to heighten her memories of the familial class structure and the pitiful wealthy who seem helpless and demand others to look after them. The older rich characters are absurd, unable to understand when the world doesn't bend to their whims. Despite being too young, Gregorio gets upset when Verónica won't get her license. But the young ones, too, have their strange demands, especially of the indigenous Ameridians, treating all of them in town as servants. One child lists off the most racist remarks, clearly learned from a parent in its strange specificity.

This film excels at showcasing two things: the manic energy of family gatherings and how the wealthy view everyone other than themselves.","criterion channel, criterion, criterion challenge 2024, cc2024, queer, written by women, directed by women, sight and sound",2025-02-25

Bare feet run down the pavement at night. Christina, in only a trenchcoat, waves down anyone who will stop for her. Desperate, she steps out in front of a passing 1951 Jaguar XK 120 Roadster. Mike Hammer swerves to the side, his car unable to start. Christina jumps into the passenger side, and they drive off. The credits roll while Christina catches her breath. When her breath settles, she asks him to take her to the first stop they find in Los Angeles. But soon, they hit a police stop. The officer is looking for a woman who escaped a psychiatric hospital nearby. Mike acts as Christina's husband to get them through.

Christina reads Mike—his car tells of how self-centered he is, how he takes and never gives. A car pulls in front of them. Out pours a gang of men who knock out Mike and take Christina. The gang tortures Christina until she dies (we can only assume based on her screams and the tools in the men's hands). They put Mike and Christina's body in his Roadster and send it careening off a cliff.

When Mike comes to, his partner, Velda, stands over him. As soon as he leaves the hospital, the Interstate Crime Commission pulls him aside to question him. They're unsatisfied with Mike's lack of cooperation but have a folder of information on the guy. Back on the street, he decides Christina is attached to something big. He's going to figure out what that is.

<blockquote><i>""They."" And who are ""they?"" They are the nameless ones who kill people for the great whatsit. Does it exist? Who cares? Everyone everywhere is so involved in a search for what?</i></blockquote>

Mike Hammer is the most noir name I've ever heard. His office has a reel-to-reel answering machine!

The film uses Schubert's Unfinished Symphony as a motif for when Hammer approaches a discovery. It reflects all of the circuitous searching Hammer does, all the futility in trying to finish a job with no end. Love is right at his fingertips with the caring Velda, but his greed is incapable of seeing it. Hammer is a fatalist who only knows pain, given or received. When money doesn't get the information he needs, Hammer takes immense pleasure in doling out pain. And every choice he makes gets himself or someone he cares about hurt.

This film is where Quentin Tarantino got the glowing case image from—the quintessential MacGuffin. The French New Wave, and Truffaut in particular, cite this movie's manic camera and constant flow of energy as a significant influence on their filmmaking.

It wasn't until 1997 that Glenn Erickson recovered the movie's original ending, dramatically changing its tone. If you watch the altered version, the film is bleak and hopeless. The original suggests a tiny sliver of hope, however small. <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20071010115722/http://www.imagesjournal.com/issue03/features/kmd1.htm"">Glenn Erickson's post about finding and restoring the ending</a> is pretty interesting.

On the outskirts of Nazareth in Israel, Santa Claus runs from a hoard of children, his sack of toys on his back. As he runs, toys fall out of his bag. The kids ignore the toys and continue after him. He scales Mount Fear to the ruins of a Franciscan chapel before the kids corner him, stabbing Santa in the chest.

This opening tells us the tone of the rest of this movie—we will see absurd things, but underneath is the common thread of the Israeli military occupation of Palestine. This military doesn't want a victory—they want a bloodbath.

We follow Palestinian Elia Suleiman, his father, and his girlfriend, who lives in the West Bank city of Ramallah, through a series of sketches depicting a day in their lives.

By the way, the movie's subtitle is ""A Chronicle of Love and Pain.""

I recently watched Suleiman's <i>It Must Be Heaven</i>, so I was prepared for his filmmaking style. He never betrays his absurd sense of humor to ""say something""—the saying is in the humor. The movie has moments of levity, but they are more heart than message.

Perhaps watching <i>It Must Be Heaven</i> ruined some of the surprises this movie would have, But there's a potency here that doesn't entirely saturate <i>It Must Be Heaven</i>. I think the ""fuck you"" to Israel is way more explicit here.

Nosey Barbon rides his bicycle to H.M. Prison Wormwood Scrubs. He greets Gulley Jimson, who just exited prison after a one-month sentence. Nosey has seen Jimson's paintings and wants to be a painter himself. Jimson tries to tell Nosey to fuck off, even going so far as to ring the door and ask the prison to let him back in. But the prison is done with Jimson and wouldn't let him back in if he tried. So, Jimson tricks Nosey into buying him a pack of cigs while Jimson steals Nosey's bike and rides away.

Jimson calls his sponsor, Mr. Hickson, the very act that landed him in prison in the first place by calling a few too many times. He calls, as different characters, trying to extort Hickson for more money. Hickson catches on immediately and has the police trace the call to a red telephone box. Because Hickson is merciful, he won't press charges. So, Jimson thinks of another strategy.

Alec Guinness wrote the screenplay, based on an Irish novel of the same name, with the hopes of playing the lead. By this point in his career, he had secured a reputation as a brilliant actor. This reputation led to director Ronald Neame giving Guinness little to no direction, and it shows. Guinness labors through each scene with his put-upon gruff voice and eccentric demeanor.

I'm not saying the movie isn't funny, only that it goes to great lengths to arrive there and only occasionally. The film hits on something I felt while in art school: to be an artist is, in one way or another, to be an extortionist. You cannot merely create something—somebody must buy it, and the artist's character sells the art just as much as the art itself.

I appreciate the film's intentions and always enjoy Guinness—even his worst performance still has its charm. However, unless you are nostalgic for a particular style of British humor, I'd say skip this one.","criterion channel, criterion, criterion challenge 2024, cc2024, edited by women",2025-02-27

Osman rides a donkey, leading another one in front of him with lumber attached to its sides to his farm. He tells his younger brother, Hasan, his plan to dam the spring on his land, preventing water from flowing into the valley. Osman knows the summer will be too dry to provide enough water for all the farmers. Once Osman can irrigate his land, he will remove the dam. Hasan begs him not to, knowing the ire this will stir. Still, Osman carries forward with his plan, telling the farmers to figure it out.

Hasan's fiancee, Bahar, stands across the way, using a handheld mirror to create a glint and attract his attention. She applies perfume to draw him deeper into the reeds when she knows he is coming. There, they discuss their love and their future. Bahar's mother says they cannot marry until after the harvest, but Hasan doesn't want to wait. So, the brothers conspire to steal Bahar away from her mother (with Bahar's consent).

Osman's greed extends to his brother's wife as he covertly watches them have sex (after getting married, of course). There's an excellent cut from Osman talking Bahar to hands going up Bahar's legs. The hands are Hasan's, but Osman wishes they were his.

Tensions brew in the village as the dry season brings fires and the farmers react.

The film explores the contradictions in claiming what was here long before us. The farmer owns land to make a living—when this movie came out, agriculture was the dominant economic force in the country. But those borders don't apply to the water that runs over and beneath the land. And yet, people still lay claim to water sources, privatizing the world's access to it.

Though Osman's move is selfish, it also reflects the hoarding mentality that capitalism fosters. Those who can possess a resource can police other's access to it. In the film, Osman has the law on his side.

These themes carry over into the treatment of Bahar as yet another resource to exploit. Osman wants Hasan and Bahar to have as many children as possible so they can work on his farm. He also recruits Bahar to work the farm and perform household chores. The film doesn't explicitly mention the unpaid labor and care that tradition heaps on women's shoulders, but the mirroring of Bahar and the water is intentional.

My biggest complaint about the movie is the number of scenes with nearly identical dialogue. It's not unrealistic but gets repetitive and doesn't move things along. Still, the film has dynamic and creative cinematography and a steady, building energy that keeps it from feeling slow.

It's worth mentioning that this film depicts actual animal deaths. Osman cuts off a chicken's head. Also, someone shoots and kills a dog, and we see the bloodied body multiple times. Both scenes are graphic, so be warned.

Though this film received a Golden Bear and had a brief run in the US, the Turkish Ministry of Interior's film censorship board banned it for its ""negative images of Turkish society."" We can watch a restored version thanks to filmmaker Fatih Akin, who brought this film to the World Cinema Foundation's attention.

The vast emptiness of the Tiboonda outback greets us. A line of railroad tracks cut through the township, with a single stop, a hotel, and a tiny school. Bored middle school children watch their teacher, John Grant, in silence while they wait for the six-week Christmas holiday to begin. The government assigned John to this post through a financial bond—he got a university education but had to work a two-year stint at a school of their choosing. Hence, Tiboonda. John dismisses the class and has a middy at the hotel bar with the barkeep, Charlie, before handing over the keys. He hears the train whistle and rushes out to catch it.

A small pack of hooligans drink beer on the train and sing songs together. Kids from John's class wave the train off. John pulls out a wallet photo of his girlfriend, Robyn, whom he's traveling to see for the holidays. He dreams of drinking a Tooth's KB Lager and watching Robyn swim in the waves. The train stops in Bundanyabba, where John will fly to Syndey the following day.

John hits a nearby pub at 8:25 PM that is supposed to close at 6:30 PM. The place is packed, but John finds a wall to lean against. He befriends local policeman Jock Crawford. They polish off a middy, and Crawford orders them another. John tries to move along, but Crawford chugs his beer and orders them another. Once Crawford gets John properly sloshed, he takes him to an RSL club (think VFW if you're American) and introduces him to two-up, an illegal gambling game that may be John's chance to pay off his bond early.

The film puts middle-class John, intelligent, well-bred, and allergic to hospitality, in a space where he feels superior to everyone around him. His arrogance becomes his downfall, and he learns the difference between simple and safe.

The film tests Western notions of ""progress"" and ""respectability"" against a wild world made of Westerners trapped in the purgatory of the outback. What does progress mean when every day looks the same? How does civility sustain itself under brute force? It doesn't. It's a lesson neoliberalism refuses to learn.

The film has an uncanny quality — John meets his fair share of characters. Small towns know how to breed them, and the barren expanse of the outback is as small as it gets. It reminds me of Blue Velvet, but it's not the same.

Gary Bond is hot. We get to see his swimming trunk tanlines if you know what I mean. He's also a tremendous actor—it makes sense he mostly did stage work. He originated the role of Joseph in Joseph and the Technicolor Dreamcoat.

I love Chip Rafferty. When I saw him, I said, ""Now, THIS is an Australian."" I looked at his Wikipedia page, and they called him ""the living symbol of the typical Australian."" Sadly, he died of a heart attack shortly after completing this role.

Donald Pleasence appears as Doc Tydon, an alcoholic who understands that discontent is a luxury available to the well-off, so he might as well appreciate where he is. This performance might be his most unhinged.

I should warn you that this film includes actual animal deaths. The filmmakers filmed a kangaroo hunt. I'll spare you the details, but it's a bloodbath. I hate kangaroos, but it's one of the most upsetting scenes I've seen. The kangaroo is now a critically endangered species because of hunts like this—this movie didn't originate it and isn't the most heinous example.

Howard Armstrong, aka Louie Bluie, was a member of America's last known black string band. A multi-instrumentalist and artist, Armstrong started performing in 1930 and recorded his first record with guitarist Ted Bogan in 1934. Though the recording was a rag, Armstrong was just as comfortable playing Gershwin, Italian, or country—he met his audience where they were.

In this doc, we spend time with Armstrong and Bogan, hearing their stories and watching them perform at home and on stage.

Armstrong's inventive humor and eccentric experiences are more compelling than I anticipated. He has a terrific collection of photos from his early performing years and drawings he did of his childhood, where he lived, and people he knew.

I didn't expect to enjoy this as much as I did! I wish they'd been able to scan or take more photos of his handmade book, ABCs of Pornography.","criterion channel, criterion, criterion challenge 2024, cc2024",2025-02-28

<blockquote><i>In China, on the Portuguese island of Macau, there lived until the end of the last century an immensely rich merchant whose name was Mr. Clay. He had a magnificent house and a splendid equipage, and he sat in the midst of both, erect, silent, and alone.</i></blockquote>

Mr. Clay once had a business partner named Louis Ducrot, whom Mr. Clay bankrupted and threw into the street. Louis committed suicide, and his daughter, Virginia, ran off with a sea captain. Clay took over Louis' house, where he now lives.

His gout kept him up at night, so his bookkeeper, Elishama Levinsky, would read the old account books to him. Tired of these, Levinsky reads a prophecy from the Bible. However, Mr. Clay believes the only thing one should ever write down is what has already happened. Mr. Clay recalls a story about a wealthy older man who pays a sailor five guineas to impregnate his wife. But Levinsky finishes the story, having heard it from other seafarers, and assures Clay that this story has not happened either.

So, the film follows Clay and Levinsky as Levinsky works to make the story happen and, therefore, true. For the role of the wife, Levinsky knows just who to hire: Virginia Ducrot.

This film is a dramatic departure for Orson Welles in several ways. Most notably, it is Welles's first movie filmed in color and the last fictional film he made in color. While the camera sometimes makes a quick cut, most scenes are shot with straightforward compositions and prolonged takes.

The script follows the story on which it's based, by Danish writer Karen Blixen—this includes the repetitious nature of Clay's speech, reflecting his fixations and inability to accept a world that does not mirror his notion. The circuitous patterns create a consistent rhythm that gives the film a parable-like quality.

The score is sparse but primarily uses Erik Satie's compositions. While this is a tired cliche now, this film was the first to do it, setting the now-overused trend.

Perhaps these deviations from Welles's proclivities helped me enjoy this movie more than his other work from the period. This film does, however, lead into Welles' fixation on the line between story and reality, which he explores in exhaustive detail in his documentary <i>F for Fake</i>.","criterion channel, criterion, criterion challenge 2024, cc2024, written by women",2025-03-02

Somewhere in the Philippines, Dr. Alan Holder and his assistant Norma inject a black substance called Death One into a dead human test subject's IV drip. The test subject, held in a glass chamber, lay dormant. But then, the test subject opens his eyes and starts convulsing. He vomits a black substance as Alan and Norma back away. His head deforms as growths form under the skin.

Dr. Holder resigns. An armed military group escorts Holder and Norma to the copter when a van pulls up, ambushing the facility and stealing the Death One serum. The helicopter chases the man down, shooting him but breaching the Death One container as well, spilling onto the thief. The infected thief checks into the Sweet River Resort.

The military can contain the spread, killing everyone at the Resort. But they made one fatal mistake: they burned the body of the infector. His ashes enter the air, spreading the disease.

The film is an unsubtle allegory for the dangers of pollution. A DJ on the radio says as much, so it's not subtext. It talks about the dangers of the hole in the ozone layer, and when a character ignores it, they get the disease.

While the movie doesn't do much for the zombie genre, especially compared to Fulci's <i>Zombi 2</i>. The production was fraught since Fulci left partway through, leaving a cut of about 50 minutes. Mattei and Claudio Fragasso finished it but left directing credit to Fulci.

That said, the movie has some fun and gory sequences, especially once the flamethrower enters the picture. I get why genre fans love this one. While I don't share their enthusiasm, I did enjoy myself.","amazon prime, cmc, cmc2017",2025-03-02

Emily Rief rushes to the bathroom to take a pregnancy test, her face drenched in dread. The test confirms her fears, but we do not see what that is. Leaving the bathroom, she eyes Maria, the janitor, with disgust.

Emily sees Brian, one of the former kids she taught in her kindergarten class, sitting on the curb. She shows him a surprise she has put together for some friends she is meeting later, as well as the manuscript for her first children's book. The book is about a dog named Little Snow, whose fur the book praises for its whiteness. When the janitor rolls past again, she encourages the boy to chastise the janitor. Brian's mother arrives to see, confused and takes Brian home.

Emily walks down a neighborhood alley. She receives a call from Jeff, an inmate at the County Correctional Facility. She declines the call and puts her phone in her bag. Leslie walks by. They walk together to the church, where they meet Kim, Majorie, and Alice. Emily unveils the surprise she showed Brian earlier—a pie with a swastica carved into it. On the whiteboard, we see the group's name written out: ""Daughters for Aryan Unity.""

The film follows the group in real time as their meeting continues, and Emily's past comes back to haunt her.

I don't know how valuable this film is. It would be different if white supremacy were the backdrop to the action we see onscreen. Green Room is an excellent example of this. But the film spends SO MUCH of its runtime just listening to these women talk about their disgust with immigrants, feminists, and other ethnic minorities.

I can say the casting is excellent—the white women look and behave like white supremacists, for what it's worth.

The film is yet another single-take gimmick. The filmmakers did multiple one-takes and seamed them together through digital transitions. The feeling that it's a single take helps with the momentum, especially when things escalate in the latter half.

Otherwise, the filmmaking is quite well done. By design, I am supposed to feel disgusted, and I haven't felt this repulsed during a horror movie in ages. So, like, how do I rate this?

I'm still curious to see what Beth de Araújo does. In the meantime, I might check out some of her shorts.","oh my horror, omh, omh2025, directed by women, written by women, edited by women",2025-03-03

<blockquote><i>The wind rises, we must try to live. — Paul Valéry</i></blockquote>

<b>Japan, 1918</b>

Jiro Horikoshi lay sleeping. In his dreams, he climbs to the rooftop, where a bird-like plane waits. He primes the engine and cuts it on. The plane lifts vertically—the clouds part. The aircraft, with wings like a bird, flies over the landscape. As he ascends, he sees enemy airships. He puts on his goggles to commence engagement, but his eyes spread apart from each other, doubling his vision. Sputtering out of control, he tries to remove the goggles. An enemy shot collides with his, sending him careening to the ground.

He awakes, his nearsighted vision blurred until he puts on his glasses. A teacher gives him a magazine that discusses Italian aircraft designer Giovanni Battista Caproni and his Caproni Ca.60. Outside, he stops some boys from bullying a small child. Bruised and beaten, he returns home, where his mother reminds him that fighting is never the answer.

He lies on the roof at night, hoping staring at the stars will fix his eyes. That night, he dreams of Ca.60s bombing a city and going down in a fire. He also dreams of Caproni, who claims they are sharing a dream. Caproni tells Jiro that building planes is better than flying them. 

Years pass, and Jiro attends Tokyo Imperial University as an aeronautical engineering student. The film follows Jiro's life designing airplanes, falling in love, and the World Wars in which his planes fly.

The film fictionalizes the real-life aeronautical engineer Jiro Horikoshi and combines aspects of the Japanese novel The Wind Has Risen. Like Miyazaki's other final film, <i>The Boy and the Heron</i>, the resulting movie is a mishmash. The story is more coherent, but Jiro is an avatar of a character—a hero who never falters from his ideals.

Though structured as a biopic, the film is not interested in Jiro Horikoshi's life as much as it focuses on Miyazaki's love of airplanes and disdain for how the military uses them in war. The film follows a similar mentality as <i>Oppenheimer</i>, where it does everything possible to make the designer of the war machine innocent and barely touches on the tangible impact of his aircraft. 

To clarify, Jiro Horikoshi designed the Mitsubishi A6M Zero, Japan's most-produced combat aircraft in WWII. Towards the war's end, the Japanese used them for kamikaze operations. However, for Miyazaki, these details are inconsequential.

The film becomes more interesting when it leans on The Wind Has Risen. Those moments are more literary, symbolic, and heartfelt. While the filmmakers weave it through, it takes about half the movie before it kicks into gear.

Of course, the animation is beautiful, and the filmmakers render the aircraft with meticulous detail.

Why did they get Hideaki Anno to voice the lead? His voice is so affectless.

The use of voice effects for the sound effects is a fascinating choice. 

It deeply saddens me that Miyazaki made this instead of his planned sequel to <i>Ponyo</i>. I would have preferred it to this or <i>The Boy and the Heron</i> any day.","max, cmc, cmc2017",2025-03-03

The wagon for Professor Powers Original Mammoth Medicine Show rides along the coast. The professor died, leaving his daughter Mary in charge of the medicine show. She didn't want to continue, but ""Flash"" Farrell persuaded her to carry on, taking the helm. They enter the town of Hickoryville, looking for who might agree to let them run their medicine show in the city. A local tells him it would be Sherrif Jim Hickory, but he isn't one for medicine shows.

Sherrif Jim Hickory and his two brawny sons, Leo and Olin, are respected members of the Hickoryville community. Jim's youngest son, Harold, however, lacks their muscle. He makes up for it with his intuition for solving problems, but the family doesn't see it that way. Harold stays behind when Jim, Leo, and Olin leave for a town meeting regarding a new dam. For fun, Harold wears his father's badge and holster.

Flash rides up, believing Harold is the sheriff. He tricks Harold into signing the ordinance, and hijinks ensue.

I was initially worried about Harold's relocation from the city to the country. But Lloyd and his team packed the movie with clever gags and impressive stunts. The cinematography brilliantly supports the jokes. When Harold climbs a tree to say goodbye to Mary, the camera follows him up—the moment gave me such a big smile. And the boat setpiece in the third act is so well-utilized!

The story has several subplots to keep things interesting: a strongman who wants Mary, a Mary-Harold romance in which she thinks Harold is the sheriff, a rivalry between Harold and Hank Hooper, and the conflict over the town dam.

Everyone has their favorite between Keaton, Chaplin, and Lloyd. As much as I love Keaton and tolerate Chaplin, Lloyd remains my favorite. This film is a delightful experience I wish to revisit in the future.","criterion channel, criterion, criterion challenge 2024, cc2024, 1001 movies",2025-03-04

Sam and Mark are actors out of work as the UK enters its third lockdown. While running from the police, Sam stumbles across the Vinewood Bowl, an amphitheater based on LA's Hollywood Bowl. He thinks about putting on a play on the stage, and Mark gives a speech from Hamlet.

So, Sam sends an online message that they will perform Hamlet at the Vinewood Bowl. As he finishes his message, a guy lands on the stage in a helicopter.

So, let's get this out of the way — this isn't a documentary. Its scripted nature becomes more apparent when other online players join in. Also, moments of fun seeming randomness come to a grinding halt with discussions of COVID, lockdown, and joblessness.

Master Sung Wu-Yang walks the temple grounds when a gang of fighters surrounds him. Although he is a pacifist in principle, he doesn't understand their intent but fights them nonetheless.

Chih-Hao, a disciple of Master Sung, receives a letter that Ta-Ming is passing through. He shares it with Master Sung's daughter and Chih-Hao's love interest, Ying Ying. They hear the fight outside and come to Wu-Yang's rescue. The fighters scatter, but Wu-Yang cannot take them on.

Ta-Ming arrives, and Wu-Yang marvels at Ta-Ming's master, Shen Chin-Pei. Chih-Hao believes Ta-Ming will be ready for the tournament at this rate. Recognizing that his age affects his ability to train Chih-Hao, Wu-Yang sends Chih-Hao to study under Master Shen. If Chih-Hao can win the tournament, he will also win Ying Ying's hand in marriage.

The film follows Chih-Hao's journey through its ups and downs. As a beginner, he must start from the bottom.

The action takes a long time to get going—we get plenty of fights, but it takes an hour before they turn from petty brawls into something with consequences. Once it does, though, this becomes quite fun.

Martial arts aficionados will balk at the fighting here—the poses are for visual purposes, not for any practical use. While I appreciate ""legitimate"" fighting choreography, I'm more interested in visually striking fights than practical ones.

This film was the first Hong Kong film to top the US box office, paving the way for Bruce Lee's <i>Fists of Fury</i> and kicking off the kung fu craze of the 1970s and 1980s. If you've heard the genre term ""chopsocky,"" this film inspired Variety to coin the term—not disparagingly but as a way of referring to the variety of martial arts films coming out of Hong Kong.

I was surprised to learn that Shaw Brothers, a HK company, made movies primarily in Mandarin. Historically, however, this makes sense—their primary audience was the Nanyang (南洋) market, which spoke Mandarin. After the Chinese Civil War and the establishment of the PRC, this market relied entirely on HK for Mandarin films.

<i>King of Jazz</i> is a musical revue. The film includes musical numbers, sketches, and an animated sequence created by Walter Lantz and Bill Nolan, who also created Woody Woodpecker.

The film is a first in several categories and an early adopter in others. It uses the volatile two-color Technicolor process—a compelling challenge for the presentation of Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue, as the two colors, red and green, do not make blue. I love the turquoise they were able to achieve as their second tone. It's so pleasant.

It is Bing Crosby's first appearance. The animated sequence is the first Technicolor animated cartoon segment, featuring a cameo from Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks's first creation, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit.

The movie feels equal parts quaint and progressive — the innocent love stories and the queer characters. The costumes are so elaborate, especially in the wedding dress bit. The sets are massive — a mainstay of the time that we have lost. So, while these sets would not have excited audiences at the time, they're pretty stunning to see today.

The Rhapsody in Blue intro has, uh, not aged well. Also, what's with Mr. King of Jazz showing up holding a black child? For what it's worth, at least we don't get full-blown minstrel blackface.

The Melting Pot number is so sinister when they melt the people down!

The film has some palpable symbolism that gives some of the darker moments an almost literary quality — blood on the flowers, an ant on a book, a pinprick while sewing.

Two Mormon missionaries, Sister Barnes and SIster Paxton, sit on a bench in Boulder, Colorado, comparing the Book of Mormon to magnum condoms. That is, we grow up hearing magnums are so much bigger than regular condoms, but Sister Paxton heard they are pretty close to the same size as regular condoms. If you grew up hearing the Book of Mormon is fake, wouldn't you fall into a similar trap? Perhaps it was the advertisement on the park bench that sparked the conversation. Regardless, the conversation leads to Paxton believing that God is real, while Barnes cannot muster the same conviction.

After some unsuccessful on-the-street proselytization (including a teenage girl pantsing Paxton to confirm she wears ""magic underwear""), the two arrive at the last address Sister Hall gave them to visit for the day: the home of a Mr. Reed, who had mentioned at some point that he was interested in hearing more about the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. As the rain picks up, they knock on the door. He cheerfully greets them at the door, reluctant but not uninterested. Mr. Reed offers to let them in, but they won't unless another woman is present. Mr. Reed tells them that his wife is inside baking a blueberry pie, so the young women enter.

Mr. Reed locks up their bikes and takes their coat. They wait in the entryway as Mr. Reed fetches them sodas, telling them that the walls and ceilings are lined with metal. When he returns, he informs them his wife is shy but will show herself soon enough. They start discussing the Mormon faith. Mr. Reed produces his heavily annotated copy of The Book of Mormon. His questions become more direct, personal, and awkward. Finally, the missionaries ask to meet his wife. He leaves to fetch her. Sister Barnes notices the candle on the table is blueberry pie scented.

Three people told me to watch this movie just this weekend, so I bumped it up on the list to check out. I've hesitated to jump on it only because I've heard the movie is r/atheism in moving picture form. 

Straight away, Sophie Thatcher and Chloe East are outstanding here. The two actors grew up Mormon, drawing from that experience to inform their characters. I had a conception of their characters, but the movie delighted me with some choices.

God, Hugh Grant sure talks a lot. I got a little excited when he mentioned The Landlord's Game because I regularly mention it, to the chagrin of my friend group. If anything, this movie has convinced me never to bring it up again.

In my religious journey, it took me some time to reach this point—that whatever your religious convictions, so long as you are not bringing harm to others, live your life. Many religious people are, but it's not people like Sister Barnes or Sister Paxton.

The score sounded like <i>Legends of the Hidden Temple</i>.

The cinematography has moments of beauty that almost feel accidental.

Marc sits before a mirror, applying his makeup before a show. He steps onto a stage and performs pop songs for his audience of older adults at a retirement home. Backstage after the show, Madame Langhoff stoically thanks Marc for bringing them so much joy. She makes a pass, pulling his hand into her lap. When he resists, she shames herself as an old slut and runs off. Marc packs up his van to head south for a Christmas gala. Mademoiselle Vicky sees him off, paying him and giving him a tearful hug. Madame Langhoff watches from the window. Marc pulls himself away and hits the highway.

As he drives, the fog grows more dense. He stops to consult his map and spots a sign for the Bartel Inn. Something passes in front of his car, and he cannot get it to start. Outside, the rain picks up, and darkness falls. He dons a coat and checks under the hood, unable to find anything wrong. He puts batteries in his cell phone when a man named Boris presses his face against the glass, looking for his dog. Marc asks Boris to help him get to the inn.

Forced to abandon his van, Marc follows Boris into the woods. They arrive at the dark inn, where Boris calls for M. Bartel. Though the inn has no other occupants, Bartel has a clean room for Marc. The following day, Bartel tows Marc's van to the inn, offering to fix it for him as a sign of solidarity between performers — Bartel is, after all, a retired comedian. When Marc goes for a walk, Bartel warns him to stay away from the village.

What lies in store for Marc? Will Boris ever find his dog?

The film is an absurdist black comedy that, unfortunately, tries to integrate genuine horror. The use of the name Bartel suggests the filmmakers's familiarity with Paul Bartel and perhaps hints at the tone the film is chasing. The humor is pretty hit or miss, especially as things get more disturbing.

The film deals with loneliness and the lengths people go to overcome it. Everyone Marc encounters sees him as the thing missing in their life, whether it be a good lay, a long-lost love, or the metaphorical second coming of Christ. It also looks at gender roles, putting Marc in what may traditionally be a feminine role, complete with makeup, and subjecting him to the lust of those around him. The film is more successful with the former than with the latter.

I understand why so many folks don't like this. It isn't scary, but it's pretty off-putting. My gripe is that I don't know if it succeeds at what it sets out to do. I was mainly on board until the third act, which reached an extreme that didn't complement the setup beyond Chekov's SA about 30 minutes in.

<blockquote><i>I think the emperor is the loneliest boy on earth.</i></blockquote>

<b>Manchuria 1950, the Chinese-Russian border</b>
Puyi arrives on a train as a political prisoner and war criminal in a crowd of other prisoners at Fushun Prison. Silently, they enter the main hall, where artists paint a mural depicting the Red Army's victory and the establishment of the PCR. A small group bows at Puyi, the former Emperor of China. Puyi steps away to the bathroom. A guard, noticing his absence, looks for him. In the bathroom, Puyi attempts suicide. The guard bangs at the door.

<b>Peking 1908</b>
A military escort enters the gates of the Forbidden City. The toddler Puyi clings to his mother. The Empress Dowager Cixi has summoned Puyi. His mother hands him off to his wet nurse, Ar Mo, who accompanies him to the Great Within. There, the Empress tells Puyi that the emperor has died, she is dying, and Puyi will be the next emperor. The impatient toddler tolerates his coronation, wishing to return home. ""Not today,"" they tell him. 

The film follows the story from these two points forward, giving us Puyi's life from infancy to imprisonment and political rehabilitation. It is about Puyi's slow decline from emperor to human being.

What a visual powerhouse—Vittorio Storaro doesn't seem to miss. It's a bummer that the movie leaves the Forbidden City halfway through. The rest of it has moments — the return to Manchuria is pretty stellar — but nothing matches the city's splendor.

The film wishes to create an othering in depicting the royal decorum. It treats Peter O'Toole's Reginal Johnston as a ""voice of reason."" Regardless of the historical accuracy, it plays into Western Orientalism.

The film does not, however, chase historical accuracy. It made several adjustments to make Puyi a more sympathetic protagonist and to allow Burtolucci his horniness quota. The Chinese government had to clear the screenplay, but producer Jeremy Thomas claims they didn't ask for much.

That said, the elaborate costuming and hair were historically correct.

To return to Puyi, he isn't much of a character in this movie, especially as an adult. He makes abrupt choices that I could never say were in or out of character because I never felt I knew him well enough to make that assessment. In that way, it eschews the typical biopic. But it also avoids a coherent throughline beyond Puyi's presence.

Ryuichi Sakamoto and Cong Su brought their A-game with this score. David Byrne also showed up.

Sarge believes enemy soldiers are on the horizon. Sam sits with him, unsure of what is happening. Nurse Janie calls Sam to dinner, assuring him no one has seen the enemy. She also visits Harriet, asking her to leave behind her doll, whom she believes is her baby. Janie mistakenly touches Harriet's baby, which causes Harriet to threaten to kill her. The threat shakes Janie. She returns to Sam to say goodbye—she cannot take her post anymore. Jennifer wanders by, dead-eyed. Danny, one of the other patients, runs into Harriet's room and steals her baby, sending her into a frenzy.

Outside, Dr. Stephens works with Judge, encouraging him to chop wood. Janie comes out to reveal her plan to leave. Judge strikes Stephens in the back with the axe, killing him. He raises it to attack Janie, but Dr. Geraldine Masters stops it. She vows to finish the work that Dr. Stephens started. Someone sneaks into Harriet's room and takes the baby… again. They leave it in Janie's room, convincing Harriet that Janie took it. So, she strangles Janie and smashes her head with a suitcase.

Soon, Charlotte Beale joins the only living doctor, Dr. Masters. Unbeknownst to Masters, Stephens hired Beale a week before. Masters is reluctant to hire someone, especially when she plans on changing how the place is run. Masters gives a long rundown of every patient and their pattern. But don't think the murders haven't stopped—the movie just takes an eternity to get there.

Conceptually, this movie is standard psych ward schlock. But the plotting is so convoluted that it's hard to tell how good the performances are. It feels like the actors are trying to make it all work but are struggling. I mean, the depictions of insanity are trash. But sometimes, the movie approaches something surreal that I kind of enjoy.

With a Z-grade budget, the movie looks like a made-for-TV movie from the era. The gore is suitable for the style—cheap but effective. And don't worry, there's a handful of superfluous nudity. You pervert.

This movie isn't for everyone's tastes—it kind of sucks. But I'm so captivated by it?? Also, as others have said, this movie doesn't belong on the Video Nasties list.

* The lack of locks on the door is wild. That's another reason I think Masters is a patient—of course, she lives on that floor, but the doctors shouldn't live in the same space, right? Or am I giving this movie too much credit?
* Man, I'm so good. 😎 Or it was obvious, I don't know.

We cold open to a train station in winter. Julien Quentin says a tearful and reluctant goodbye to his mother before boarding the train back to his Catholic boarding school. He rides the train with his face to the glass, watching the French countryside pass him. Cut to the uniformed students marching up the street singing a school song. That night, as they prepare to go to bed, a kid steals Julien's jam, claiming in German to have confiscated it.

Père Jean brings a new student to the bed next to Julien's, telling the room that the boy's name is Jean Bonnet. The moment Père Jean leaves, the kids harangue Jean. Julien looks at Jean's books, seeing that he is reading Sherlock Holmes. Jean tries to introduce himself, but Julien gives him the same aggressive treatment. Even the English teacher refuses to pronounce Jean's last name correctly, perhaps thinking it's a joke.

Still, Jean exudes a quiet confidence, making friends through his earnest generosity. Julien finds himself reluctantly drawn to Jean—the two are, after all, huge book nerds. During a math class where Jean displays his math ability, an air raid interrupts the class, sending the kids to the shelter, where the math class continues. As the bombs drop, the kids recite a prayer from memory. Jean looks around, not knowing the prayer. Similarly, Jean looks stoically forward when all the kids recite the Lord's Prayer at bedtime.

The movie follows Julien as he gets to know Jean. Jean has a secret that will bond their unlikely friendship.

Youth has a way of dismissing moments of transcendence. We miscalculate the rarity of finding a four-leaf clover with the same imprecision as we hear our friend's stories. We avoid places of untold beauty because we believe wolves hide in them. Like all humans, we cannot leave a thought incomplete and use the scant details we've accrued thus far to get a picture of our world. How many friendships arrive from quiet assumptions that the other agrees with us? How many enemies form from misconstruing intent?

Through the schoolyard bullying and interactions, we see the conflicts these children are aware of, however vaguely. A kid steals Julien's jam, claiming in German to confiscate it. When Julien trades his jam for some stamps, the kid with whom he trades calls him ""a real Jew"" for haggling.

I love how mean the piano teacher is. I am always happy to see Irène Jacob, however briefly. This movie was her first role!

This script is one I could imagine teaching in a screenplay class. Each scene is rich with small details that give a sense of place, time, and character. The pacing is pretty much perfect. The movie is thoughtful and treats its audience as such.

A Boeing B-29 Superfortress takes off, with a smaller Bell X-1A, code-named Y-12, strapped beneath it. A space positioning team, led by US Navy Commander Chuck Prescott, observes as the plane rises past 15 thousand feet. All measurements are coming in correctly. At 45 thousand, the Y-12 drops and ignites its rockets, tilting the rocket toward space. The pilot? Prescott's brother, Lt. Dan Prescott.

The aircraft surpasses 50,000 feet through the controllability barrier, breaking all previous altitude records. Once it hits the ionosphere, the rock shuts off. Dan is supposed to begin his descent, but he keeps it going to see what the ship can do. Dan passes 100,000 feet, and the plane spins out of control. Ground control tries to take over remotely but can't get a connection. He trails out of radar range.

That night, the New Mexico State Police report a plane landing in Puerco. The police meet Chuck and guide him to the wreckage. Chuck gets word that Dan is fine—he went home for clothes and met up with his dame, Tia. Though Chuck is incensed at his brother's behavior, the Pentagon is impressed, and Dan will pilot the next iteration, Y-13, which will hit 600,000 feet.

Will Dan follow Chuck's orders, or will his desire to be the first man in space bring him in contact with something unseen? I'll give you a hint: it involves a dense cloud, a fuselage encased in an unknown rock-like material, and a ton of slaughtered cows.

On paper, this movie is yet another space horror from the 50s. But in the textures, we get a good bit more. While not impressive, the effects are fun for an independent British film. The film introduces relationship dynamics that add friction to the already tense situation. The lighting has moments that effectively create a sense of foreboding.

That said, this isn't the most exciting movie. You can predict most of it, and the characterization isn't groundbreaking. But with so many MST3Ks under my belt (including this movie's rip-off, <i>The Incredible Melting Man</i>), a decent 50s sci-fi flick goes a long way for me.

This movie is supposedly a <i>Quatermass Xperiment</i> rip-off, so I should probably check that out.","criterion channel, criterion, cmc, cmc2017, britsploitation, scifiploitation",2025-03-13

Dozens of men walk the Chilkoot Pass in Alaska, all seeking the same thing: gold. One lone prospector, Big Jim McKay, strikes gold far away from the others. Meanwhile, in the middle of nowhere, our intrepid Tramp makes his way along rock ledges, his backpack in tow. Scaling down a snowy embankment, the Tramp passes bears and buried bodies, narrowly avoiding trouble with the aid of his trusty hand-drawn compass.

A storm picks up, and the Tramp makes his way to a cabin occupied by Black Larsen, a wanted criminal, and his dog. The Tramp, unaware of Black Larsen's status with the law, fights the man for a place to stay. Joining them is Big Jim, who overpowers Larsen, forcing them into a truce. Through many days of raging storms, the hungry men work to survive.

Finally, Black Larsen sets out to find food, leaving Big Jim and The Tramp alone. Black Larsen also finds Big Jim's claim. How will the Tramp get out of this one?

I watched the original silent 1925 version or at least the closest approximation Kevin Brownlow and David Gill could create from assorted sources since the original print is still lost.

The shoe gag is an all-timer — same with the Tramp turning into a giant chicken. I feel like Looney Tunes modeled several characters after Big Jim. But all the memorable gags are in the first third of the movie. After that, things get less enjoyable.

This movie came out around the time that Chaplin got Lita Grey, then 15 years old, pregnant and married her to avoid a statutory rape charge. He had an affair with costar Georgia Hale that instigated Grey's divorce from Chaplin. He was such a messy bitch who lived for drama.

I know this is one of the great American silent comedies. As I've said in countless other reviews, I don't get much out of Chaplin's schtick. I like the movie—I found the New Year's scene affecting.

They chase her into a walkway. When she thinks she has evaded them, another member bursts from the trash and attacks her. They strangle her and steal her purse, running off and leaving her straggling but alive in the alleyway. 

Cut to Lonnie Lord, a multi-million record-selling rock and roll singer with a ""legion"" of fans. He signs some autographs in Hollywood, carrying his guitar just in case. He and his girlfriend, Cee Bee Beaumont, ride the merry-go-round and frolic through the park—you know, adult stuff. We get a montage of their assorted activities as Ron Haydock's Runnin' Wild plays.

The Chain Gang sits around, antsy to do more crime. They look up a name at random in the phonebook to target. Who else would it be but Cee Bee Beaumont? What's going to happen? Who will come to her rescue?

The movie maintains a pretty grim tone for the first half—funny but because of goofy choices. Then, out of nowhere, Lonnie and the gardener turn into Rat Pfink and Boo Boo to save Cee Bee. From there, the film turns into something of a Batman parody. The movie is way more successful with the silly superhero tone, but success is relative here.

A crowd gathers at a London music hall theatre to see Mr. Memory, a vaudevillian act in which he answers trivia questions asked by the audience. The rowdy crowd gives Mr. Memory a good ribbing, but he remains in good humor and quickly answers the answerable questions. Among the questioners is Canadian Richard Hannay, who asks how far Winnipeg is from Montreal. In proper Brit form, a brawl picks up at the bar. Two discharges of gunfire send people running for the doors.

Outside, a woman asks to come home with Hannay. He consents but doesn't think of asking her name until they arrive at his apartment. He guesses at her occupation, but she prevents Hannay from turning on the lights before they enter the living quarters. She finds a hiding place away from the windows and asks him to turn the mirror facing them. He complies. She introduces herself as Annabella Smith and says that she fired the shots in the theatre to create a diversion from two men who will stop at nothing to kill her.

""Have you heard of The 39 Steps?"" she asks Hannay. When he hasn't, she continues explaining that she is the only one who can stop them. Her next stop is in Scotland, where she will meet a man. Later that night, Smith burst into the room, telling Hannay to run. She collapses over his lap, a knife in her back and a map in her hand—the phone rings. Hannay looks onto the street and sees two men at the phone booth. He takes the map from her hand. Circled is Alt-na-Shellach in Killin.

Whether he likes it, Hannay is now enmeshed in Smith's plot. Worse still, he is now the target of a nationwide search for Smith's murderer. Can Hannay clear his name? What are The 39 Steps?

Though this film doesn't fall into film noir territory, it certainly has many of its trappings — shadowy alleys, femme fatales, and the MacGuffin from which the troupe gets its name. It also contains several of what would become Hitchcock signatures: an innocent man on the run, a Hitchcock cameo, and ""Hitchcock blondes.""

The film explores deception and truth-telling. Those who tell the truth are ridiculed or disbelieved. Only when the truth-teller concocts a more believable lie can they get through to someone. Our Mr. Memory is all about facts, but the audience is more interested in ribaldry and mockery. When Hannay tries to escape his apartment, he tries to get the milkman to give over his coat and hat by telling the milkman the truth. The milkman thinks it's a joke until Hannay invents a story about a married woman and her suspicious husband.

The screenplay adaptation of John Buchan's book makes several divergences to turn the lucky accidents of the novel into logical steps for Hannay to take. For example, the map with Alt-na-Shellach circled isn't in the book—instead, Hannay runs off to hide in Scotland and happens upon this precise location. The film still has moments of coincidence, but they don't interfere with suspension of disbelief.

The English actors playing Scottish have such pitiful accents! When the crofter's wife, Margaret, said she was from Glasgow, I couldn't help but laugh. The actress is Dame Peggy Ashcroft if you're familiar with her. I suppose the British didn't want to risk hiring an actor that their audience couldn't understand.

My biggest complaint is all the non-consensual stuff that Hannay puts Pamela through. It's the type of stuff Harrison Ford perfected in the 1980s — abuse by any other name.

This movie is so fun! The political speech is such a funny moment—countless movies have imitated it, and I'll dare say none have done it as effectively.

When Dolly looks back, she notices Laura's absence, only for Laura to return a moment later. Dolly comments on Laura's peckish appearance. Their train arrives, and the two board.

<blockquote><i>This can't last. This misery can't last. I must remember that and try to control myself. Nothing lasts, really—neither happiness nor despair. Not even life lasts very long. There'll come a time in the future when I shan't mind about this anymore when I can look back and say quite peacefully and cheerfully how silly I was. No, no, I don't want that time to come ever. I want to remember every minute, always—always to the end of my days.</i></blockquote>

Laura returns home to her husband, son, and daughter. Tomorrow is her son Bobby's birthday. Her children go to bed, and Laura sits to chat with Fred. Out of the blue, Laura starts to weep uncontrollably. Fred is the one person she wishes to confide in, but she knows that, even if she did when they were old and all their years were behind them, it would still hurt Fred to see the truth—that she has fallen in love with someone else.

Through flashbacks and narration, Laura recalls the circumstances through which she met Alec and how their relationship blossomed in secret. It all began in the Milford Junction refreshment room.

The film also explores another relationship between Myrtle and Albert in the refreshment room. As this is their place of work and the only place we see them, the nature of their relationship only comes to the surface through suggestion and innuendos. In that way, the refreshment room serves the opposite purpose for them as it does for Laura and Alec.

The cinematography is perfect. The eloquent framing, the suggestive lighting, the sharp transitions—you could mute this movie and get so much of the story, as unspoken moments tell much of it. Most importantly, the movie doesn't adorn every scene with dramatic compositions—it knows when those moments are necessary for the story. The economics of these choices are lessons that many contemporary filmmakers could consider.

Every scene has a brilliant moment. I love it when Laura stands on the train platform, suddenly overcome with a sense of danger. Just then, a train passes, illuminating her face and filling the space with smoke, creating a disorienting sense of physical threat to accompany Laura's emotional one. Similarly, when Laura asks Fred if Dr. Harvey can come for dinner, and he asks if it could be lunch so he wouldn't have to be there, Laura breaks into uncontrollable laughter as all her worry burns away. Also, I love when she's on the train, and she catches her smile in her reflection.

Noel Coward's exploration of forbidden love is open to several interpretations beyond the affair itself. The one I find most compelling is that Alec and Laura's plight mirrors that of many gay men of the time, especially with the rise of laws surrounding homosexuality, making the social conditions in which their relationship could be consummated neigh impossible.

I adore this movie. Between this, <i>The Bridge on the River Kwai</i>, and <i>Blithe Spirit</i>, David Lean is quickly becoming a favorite director of mine.","criterion channel, criterion, criterion challenge 2024, cc2024, palme d'or winner, 1001 movies, sight and sound",2025-03-16

Screams, shouts, bombs explode — the English Civil War is underway. A frenzied man named Whitehead pushes through the dense foliage, the voice of Commander Trower snarling for him. A soldier named Cutler approaches. Trower spots Cutler, only for a spear to penetrate his chest from behind. Culter puts a pistol bullet through Trower, killing him. Whitehead looks behind him and sees the outline of two men. It seems as though Culter cannot see them.

A bomb explodes, stabbing Whitehead's ears with a painful ringing. Culter saws off Trower's finger to take a ring off it, seemingly unbothered by the blast. He walks to another body, robs it, and uses it as a place to rest. A man named Jacob emerges from the fog and starts strangling Whitefield, claiming to have seen Whitefield fighting for the other side. Culter calms the man with the promise of ale. The body on which Culter rested comes to at the word ""ale."" He demonstrates that he's supposed to be the comedic relief, and the four of them desert the battle and cross the field to find said ale.

In the whatever of them crossing the field, Whitehead reveals that he is the assistant to an alchemist and astrologer. I'm only mentioning it because they keep hammering it, so it must be important. They camp in a part of the field where mushrooms grow. Culter picks some and cooks a soup with them. All eat except for Whitehead, who is fasting. They continue marching, arriving at a wooden post with unusual carvings. Friend cannot pull himself away from it. They tie a rope around the stump to try and pull it out. After much time and effort, they pulled out a man—the Wizard O'Neill, whom Whitehead had been seeking.

What strange magic is happening? Or did those mushrooms have more to them than they suspected?

The filmmaking pushes the limits of comprehensibility, with disorienting cuts and framing that make it difficult to track who is who or where they've gone. The 2010s shakey-cam does the film no favors, which the film cannot avoid doing, even in the most banal scenes. The film also has its share of more surreal shots, such as everyone pausing, pretending at a photo while the camera rolls, people's limbs tremor, and the wind tossing their clothes. Or when they pull the rope, the camera swoops through them like a recursive loop.

At first, I wasn't having a good time with this movie, but then I decided to smonk when the boys eat their mushrooms and see what happens. 100% would recommend.

The movie wins points with me for being obstinant—the weirder it got, the more on-board I became. Like, a human divining rod? I'm in. 

I totally get why folks don't like this—the plot is downright tedious. I get why people love it, too. I'm leaning more towards not liking it, but because I only really liked the aesthetics.","tubi, oh my horror, omh2025, omh, folk horror, written by women, folk horror: a study",2025-03-17

<blockquote><i>The following is a true story. I present it as it happened, without adornment.</i> — Robert Bresson</blockquote><blockquote><i>At this site, under German occupation, 10,000 men suffered victims of the Nazis. Seven thousand passed away.</i> — A plaque outside Montluc prison in Lyon</blockquote><b>Lyon, 1943</b>
A hand sneaks to the handle of a car door but pulls back. The man, Fontaine, sits, his hands unshackled, next to two men, handcuffed together. The free man looks for his opportunity. When the car stops, he jumps out of the vehicle. A German car full of soldiers followed them, so they apprehended Fontaine and cuffed him at once. They also bash him over the head with the butt of their pistol. They throw the bloodied man into a jail cell at Montluc.

Fontaine finds a way to climb up to the window, where he can communicate with Terry, who is a member of a small, unsupervised group outside. Terry throws Fontaine some twine, and the two begin regular exchanges of letters and goods. Among them is a safety pin, allowing Fontaine to remove his cuffs when unsupervised. The warden brings Fontaine to him, demanding a promise that he will not try to escape again.

Outside, the sound of bullets reminds Fontaine that the prison executes inmates. The prisoners walking outside move, unphased by the inconsistent ricochet. Fontaine determines that he will escape at the first opportunity he gets. His plan grows more complex when the Germans move him to the top floor of the prison.

Bresson further refines the aesthetic goals he began exploring in <i>Diary of a Country Priest</i>. He uses non-actors, concerned with the artificiality of acting under the intense scrutiny of the camera lens. When he hired actors, he first looked for models of ""innocence,"" a concept Antonioni would expand on in the following decade.

In this, Bresson chases the aspects of film that make it distinct from all other media—the framing and duration of the film tied to the creation of space, that time can capture what a single image cannot. Words capture character, but their actions throughout define them, however abstract.

Now, all of this is nothing without pacing and intuition—otherwise, you may as well set up a surveillance camera. The edits wish to give us as much information as we need and not an iota more. Of course, in 2025, our sense of fast pace is quite different from 1956 Bresson's.

Still, we see the desire for efficiency in how Bresson removes in-between frames of actions to shorten them and render the scene tighter. However, the use of narration, while sparse for its time, still weighs heavily on the film.

This film is one of Kieślowski's favorites—the sparseness <i>of The Decalogue</i> wears this movie's influence. Like Kieślowski, this movie may bore many audience members.

<b>WARNING: spoilers for Puppet Master are inevitable. Readers beware.</b>

In the Shady Oaks cemetery, behind the Bodega Bay Inn, the puppet called Pinhead opens the casket of André Toulon, the puppeteer who brought his puppets to life back in 1939 before committing suicide. Along with four other puppets, Pinhead pours a vial onto Toulon's corpse. The puppets watch as the skeletal corpse becomes animate.

Carolyn Bramwell tries some keys on the doors of the Bodega Bay Inn to no avail. She returns to her US Investigators of Paranormal Claims van, where her brother Patrick awaits. She asks Patrick to break in while letting Lance and Wanda out of the back of the van. Camille Kenney joins the team at the hotel, where they set up cameras and measurement tools. But she doesn't trust their tools, relying on her psychic abilities.

<blockquote><i>I'm afraid a great violence was done here. The taint of unholy fury has been absorbed by every particle of this place.</i></blockquote>

At dinner that night, they discuss the former owner, Megan Gallagher, and her violent murder in which the killer extracted her brain through her nose. Alex Gallegher, our lone survivor from movie one, is now in an asylum after authorities believe his premonitions are lunatic ravings. But Carolyn reads an account of Toulon's suicide that corroborates Alex's rantings. Before they can conclude, Camille screams, having spotted two puppets. The gang goes to investigate but finds nothing.

Still, Camille warns them that they are all in danger as long as they remain in this house—I mean, inn. She plans to leave the paranormal investigators to their own devices to learn the truth—if they live to find it.

<i>[cue evil laugh, lightning strike, and the most annoying MIDI strings you've ever heard]</i>

Like the first Puppet Master, this film bombards us with information before the first act finishes, leaving me scrambling to determine the plot. I omitted four characters just to keep my summary brief. Still, with all the lore from the first movie established (and reestablished here), we get to action much quicker.

I like the puppet work and claymation! It's not high quality, but it's fun. Steve Welles is the only actor who appears to be having a good time. His Toulon is so silly.

I wish the movie was just pulpy puppet nonsense, but it spends SO MUCH time watching people chat, and it adds nothing to the film.

A pond of water catches a single ripple. Karin, her husband, Martin, her father, David, and her younger brother, Minus, leave the water and wade to the jetty. They climb the rocky beach to the vacation cottage where they are staying.

Martin and David talk of putting out the nets, pretending the cold that coats them isn't so bad. David is almost finished with his book—he's been in Switzerland writing it for some time now. Martin realizes that David did not get a letter regarding Karin. Once they've rowed out, they discuss Karin's recent stint in a mental hospital. Karin's psychologist suggested that she may never recover. Still, Martin loves her and will stay by her side.

Karin and Minus grab the milk can. She hears a cuckoo, but Minus doesn't hear it. Karin blames her illness, or perhaps the electroshock therapy, as the cause of her acute hearing. Minus earnestly talks about his father's writing, causing Karin to laugh and grab his cheeks. Minus pulls away abruptly, upset by Karin's physical touch. He chastises her for hugging and kissing him and for sunbathing half-naked. Karin pities Minus's frustration with women, which only angers him further.

Over dinner that evening, David announces that he will be leaving on yet another trip to write despite promising otherwise. He retreats to the cottage to cry. When he returns, the others blindfold him and take him to a makeshift stage, on which the other three perform a small play for David called The Artistic Haunting or The Tomb of Illusions. The play focuses on an artist who does not create and would die for a ghost. Although he praises the others for their work, David takes offense, assuming the artist is him.

<blockquote><i>Oblivion shall own me, and death alone shall love me.</i></blockquote>

Karin and Martin, when alone, talk of the sounds that only Karin hears and Martin's assurance that these sounds are all in her head. She doesn't believe him, though. Martin tries to initiate sex, but Karin pulls away and says goodnight. Later that night, Karin believes she hears a foghorn in the attic, so she investigates. While there, she puts her ears against the wallpaper, hearing people whisper behind it.

The film follows these threads over 24 hours and watches the consequences unfold.

The sets have a set-like minimalism, and Bergman blocks certain scenes like a stage play. The film's three distinct acts also mirror a play. 

Harriet Andersson is so brilliant in this. Of course, Björnstrand and von Sydow are great but pale in comparison. Lars Passgård is fine, but there's a reason he isn't in any other Bergman films.

The title of the film comes from 1 Corinthians 13—a subsection Christian weddings often use:
 <blockquote><i>Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy; it does not boast; it is not proud.</i></blockquote>

And so on. Later in the section that this film derives its name from:

<blockquote><i>For we know in part, and we prophesy in part. But when that which is perfect is come, that which is in part shall be done away. When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child. But, when I became a man, I put away childish things. We see now through a glass, darkly, but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also am known.</i></blockquote>

This passage suggests a partial insight into the way of the world that we will know in full once we are in heaven. These concepts play out in the movie themes in several ways. In some ways, Minus is the child who has not yet put down childish things. He experiences the separation from his father that the author of 1 Corinthians felt from God. Minus wishes his father would talk to him just once. Then Minus might know how much of his father he sees.

Karin's illness (perhaps schizophrenia, though it isn't stated explicitly in the movie) allows her to hear voices that no one else does. Has she been granted a divine right to the word of God? Is she experiencing the maddening words of the devil? Or are these merely aspects of her illness? Her relationship with Minus distorts the notion of ""brotherly love."" As she comes to distrust Martin and David, this leaves Minus, to whom she confides her unusual thoughts.  

Martin wishes to embody the patient and kind love that 1 Corinthians 13 suggests. Though, like many believers, part of him seems only to want to do so because he fears the world without her. When Karin learns of the incurable nature of her condition, she pushes Martin to find love elsewhere, though perhaps unintentionally. David is more overt in his push for Martin to avoid what David considers to be ""unnecessary suffering.""

David builds a theory that God is love, and love is God. In this way, he wishes to give meaning to his life and counter his son's message from the play that ""death alone shall love him."" Though the film ends on this idea, Bergman returns to it in an almost mocking way in <i>Winter Light</i>—he said in interviews that he regretted how he ended <i>Through a Glass Darkly</i>, suggesting that he had created ""a diffuse veneer of love all over it.""

However, these sentiments also reflect Bergman's self-concept as an exploitative filmmaker who cannot create art without drawing from his own life. As David sees the artist as himself in Minus' play, Bergman sees himself as David, too. This remorseless self-regard informs the cold, inhuman touch of so many of his movies. This austere reflection on mortality and meaning may feel humorless, even quaint. But the humanity that pours through these characters still feels alive today.","criterion channel, criterion, criterion challenge 2024, cc2024, 1001 movies",2025-03-19

A riffle tip peaks out from behind a snow bank. Across the way, a man in black rides his horse over the white canvas of snow. The man in black stops, an unease coming over him, and he surveys the hills. He ungloves his right hand and draws his Mauser C96. Bullets fly. The three men with riffles lay dead, bullet wounds on their heads. A fourth man comes out, hands in the air in surrender. ""I'm through with bounty hunting! Don't kill me, Silence!"" The man in black, named Silence, shoots this man's thumbs off, rendering them unable to fire a gun.

The man still tries, and a boy from over the hill kills the man. A group from Snow Hill follows down, paying Silence for handling the bounty hunters. The boy who fired demands a thanks from Silence. But Silence rides off. A townsperson explains to the boy that Silence only ever shoots in self-defense, and Silence doesn't seem to think the man is a threat anymore. The boy leaves the group and runs back home to his mother. Also, there is a ""lawyer,"" Charlie, and a bounty hunter named Loco. Charlie shoots the boy, and the two drag his body into town, leaving the mother to wipe her son's blood from her face.

The governor of Utah appoints Gideon Burnett as the new sheriff, demanding that he bring a stop to this murder for reward business. It's 1898, for crying out loud—the wild west is dead. So, he sends Burnett to Snow Hill。 There, Loco tortures a man for bounty information, dragging him behind his horse. The mother has a funeral for her son. Silence comes into town and gets a hot meal. The mother approaches him, offering Silence a horse, all she can offer, in exchange for the death of Charlie, the lawyer. With no hesitation, Silence tracks him down and kills him.

When Loco pulls a similar move, killing a woman's husband, she hires Silence to stop him once and for all. But Loco knows Silence and his methods.

<blockquote><i>They call him Silence because wherever he goes, the silence of death follows.</i></blockquote>

The film explores the myth of the dying Wild West. Yes, cowboys aren't roaming the prairies on horseback as they once did, but the crooks who killed for profit took political and corporate power, hiding their crimes behind the technicalities of law. The people steal, but only out of necessity—the powers that be stand to gain more from their death than in helping the town live. Like brokers shorting stocks, the government bets on you losing; they call it law and common sense.

But as Silence shows, two can play that game. There is no victory when only one side is playing fair. So then, how can one corrupt the law to fight the powers that be? Can that be the one path to correcting such laws in the first place?

Klaus Kinski has never had trouble playing a villain in real life or movies. His character was supposedly influenced by Gorca in Bava's <i>Black Sabbath</i>.

Jean Louis Trintignant only did this Western, but he demonstrated that he knew exactly how to play the revisionist Western protagonist — not good, but not as bad as the other. 

The score has some tremendous moments—definitely my favorite part of the movie.

The movie doesn't always make great use of its time. There's depicting a long horse ride, and then there's making us watch a long horse ride.

At night, spiders catch creatures in their massive webs. The sun rises, peeking into the valleys between mountains. At Jing Lu Fort, nature overtakes the once mighty stronghold. Deeper in, we go to the General's Mansion, where statues of tigers guard the vacant home.

Still, a village survives in and around the fort. A man and his mother live inside the fort. What are a few ghosts in exchange for free rent? He leaves his home and opens his Letter and Couplet Writing shop—a sign bears his name: Gu Sheng-zhai. A man approaches the shop and observes a portrait hanging on the wall. Gu offers to paint the man's picture. The man, Ouyang Nian, is a stranger to these parts, while Gu has lived here his whole life. Dr. Yu, Gu's herbalist, stops by to say hello. Ouyang stops the portrait, promising to return tomorrow, and sneaks off.

Gu returns home as night falls and hears a chime from the General's Mansion. Has someone moved into this haunted place? His mother serves him dinner and encourages him to take the civil servant exam. But Gu is content with his work and hopes to become a teacher. This dichotomy of power vs. knowledge causes a rift between them. The chime continues, and Gu follows the sound back to the mansion and inside. As he goes deeper in, he triggers a trap. But he also recognizes forging tools that are still hot.

The following day, Ouyang returns to finish his portrait. He and Gu discuss ghosts. Gu does not believe in ghosts like his mother, but Ouyang thinks he should. Gu consults a book of Taoist spells to ward off ghosts. He fashions a wooden sword inscribed with a warding spell. But when he gets to the mansion's doors, a woman and his mother emerge.

The woman's name is Yang Hui-zhen. Believe it or not, the movie is about her and the people looking for her. Our protagonist, Gu, is a sort of Dr. Watson, acting as a witness to the story unfolding. Classic Chinese literature also took the approach of shifting the protagonist.

With this film, King Hu wanted to adapt a story from Liaozhai Zhiyi, a favorite collection of stories from his time as a student. The problem was that the stories were not complex and overly didactic without providing any meaningful message. So, Hu took a tale called The Heroic Maid (Xianü, also the Chinese name for this movie) and added ""a touch of zen""—not as a religious approach, but as a way of enhancing the story.

This insight into filmmaking—that simple plots provide opportunities for enhanced visual design and style—pushed Hu to expand what wuxia can do without abandoning its core concepts. Hu's obsession with detail drained him of financial resources, but he would not relent on the art he wanted to inject into this film. The filmmakers built the fort and town by hand, taking months. The result, however, is worth it, as we occupy the most grounded wuxia at that time.

The story, too, shows this patience, waiting an hour before giving us the first fight. The plot hints at things to come and establishes visual motifs—a glint in the eye, a doctor with a secret, and so on—but this slowed pace allows the viewer to live in this space and see all the hard-earned detail.

Hu also incorporated The Eastern Depot as a sort of anti-James Bond presence. Like Bond, this special service organization has a license to arrest and kill anyone, even people in the high courts, with impunity. Hu saw these types of organizations as threats, physically and morally, and so used the film to expose The Eastern Depot's corrupt deeds.

Chinese opera influenced the fight sequences—like many Shaw Brothers kung fu fights, the filmmakers did not base the moves on any specific school. Instead, the film creates dances, allowing the fight's storytelling to stand out.

Based on this and <i>Legend of the Mountain</i>, I assumed King Hu just made long movies, but I guess these are his two longest. I'm looking forward to watching more of his films and seeing what he does with a more condensed runtime.

A final note: I love how the movie pushes against Confucian aspects of traditional Chinese culture with the Buddhist monks, who seem to function in harmony with nature rather than at war with it. There's a moment towards the end where they show up, and it's one of the most beautiful scenes I've seen in a wuxia.","criterion channel, criterion, criterion challenge 2024, cc2024, 1001 movies, sight and sound, wuxia, golden horse",2025-03-21

Titus Cromwell, King of Aragon, rows ashore to Tomb Island, a ""rocky crag perched at the far edge of the world."" Cromwell enters a tomb with a soldier and a woman whom Cromwell calls a witch to awaken the long-dead sorcerer, Xusia of Delos. Cromwell asks Xusia to help him to recover the land of Ehdan, the wealthiest kingdom in the world. The soldier demands a demonstration of Xusia's powers. The creature sends the witch, his servant, colliding into the wall and psychically rips out her heart. Xusia will help Cromwell take Ehdan and take what he sees as rightfully his.

Cromwell's armies, led by Xusia, cross into Ehdan and slaughter countless soldiers. With all but one army gone, Cromwell decides to kill Xusia before he becomes too powerful. He stabs the weary Xusia and pushes him off a cliff. Richard receives word of the invasion from his son, Tavis, cursed to death by black magic. Richard orders his family's evacuation, arming his now-only son, Talon, with a three-bladed sword. Talon escapes, but his mother and father die at Cromwell's hands.

Talon will have his vengeance, and so will the still-living Xusia. Did I mention that Talon's three-bladed sword shoots the swords like projectiles?

The movie has no breathing room, with every scene being epic. If the whole film is epic moments, they start to feel less… epic, you know? Still, if the script sucks, like this one does, then making a movie of just the epic moments might be the best choice.

The biggest issue is that its relatively low budget overshadows the movie's ambitions. While we get some cool gore effects, we don't see much magic. The film makes up for it a bit with some legit set pieces—the face-covered altar and an underground throne.

Looks, can anyone in this movie act? No. Are the costumes, hair, and makeup laughable? Yes. But I wasn't bored and can't say that for many sword and sorcery flicks.

Stewart is a former college football player and engineer. His wife hates him so much she fakes suicide. He brings a signed football to a 10-year-old named Corry because Stewart put Corry's dad on a project that got him killed. Corry's mom, Denise, got a bit part in a movie, so Stewart runs lines with her and looks at her like fresh meat. He's clearly cheating on his wife with this woman 20 years his junior.

A slight tremor in LA comes and goes, but it somehow affected the Mulholland Dam, as one of the caretakers drowned in an elevator shaft. The California Seismological Institute doesn't see anything to be alarmed about, but a junior seismologist named Walter thinks otherwise. He believes LA is two days away from a major quake but wants confirmation on his numbers.

We also meet Officer Lew Slade, who the captain suspended for punching a fellow cop. Another small quake traps two scientists, burying some measuring thingamajig. Miles Quade, a pseudo-Evel Knievel, has a dangerous stunt setup. Just read the cast list; it's endless. Thankfully, the filmmakers cut 30 more minutes of character setup to get to the actual movie. Walter receives confirmation of his numbers and warns the mayor. However, the mayor doesn't want to worry people, so he only alerts the National Guard and the police.

Is Walter onto something? Or are we just wasting our time? Why not both? 
 
In case you thought Hollywood's creative bankruptcy was a recent development, here's a movie whose sole purpose is to capitalize on the success of <i>Airport</i>. Universal had a Mario Puzo screenplay, but they found it too expensive and shelved it. But while Fox got their cash-in out first with <i>The Poseidon Adventure</i>, Universal jumped back on this. While they beat <i>The Towering Inferno</i> to theaters, <i>Inferno</i> beat out <i>Earthquake</i> critically and financially.

Also, like so many movies these days, the cast is needlessly stacked to give the film legitimacy. Even Walter Matthau makes a cameo but demands to be credited as Walter Matuschanskaysky to avoid tarnishing his reputation. And, as you can see, these plots have nothing to do with the rest of the movie—they're little melodramas meant to connect us to the characters without any consideration for themes or cohesion.

It isn't until about an hour in that we get all the good set pieces as the 9.9-scale earthquake devastates the city. It all looks pretty great except for the elevator sequence, which freezes, and an animated splotch of blood shoots at the screen. A pane of glass falls on someone's face—that scene made me squirm.

This film involved a significant number of injuries to the stunt people—falling concrete, falls from 60 feet, motorcycle crashes, concussions, and broken bones. The filmmakers claimed to take every precaution, but the facts speak for themselves. Worse still, the filmmakers didn't use an elevator scene that injured several stunt people over multiple takes. Instead, we get the weird animated blood sequence.

If I'm being honest, my favorite aspect of this movie is Ava Gardner's theatrics. She knows she's in schlock and doesn't give her performance the same labored levity as others.

The grocer obsessed with Rosa is the scariest part of this movie — he made my skin crawl.

""Not for pleasure alone,"" reads the sign above the toy stage. Alexander draws up its backdrops to play with the paper characters, lighted by a row of candles. He calls for his sister, Fanny, and his mother, wandering the seemingly empty house. He falls asleep under a table as the clock chimes 3. A statue in the corner comes to life, dancing.

It's Christmas Eve. Grandmother Helena walks through the house, directing the housekeepers and ensuring everything is set for the evening Christmas party. The family puts on a Nativity play, followed by the party. Adults delight the children with dances, fart jokes, and pillow fights — meanwhile, the adults navigate the years of resentments, worries, and complications.

Helena worries about her son, Oscar — why he married Emile, how bad an actor he is, and how he's making himself sick running the theater. So, when Oscar dies of a stroke, the problems of the adults become the problems of the children, too.

Karyn Kusama describes the film as ""when you have lived at a moment in time where you believed in magic."" The film is a culmination of Bergman's career fixations, getting at the fundamental motives behind the existential questions that drove his earlier films. He sets aside the ideas and experimental ways he explored them in the past while maintaining the formalism that made him such a beloved filmmaker.

I related most to Alexander's experience when he was under the bishop's care. The need to learn to lie to keep the peace, the ""conversations"" that are admonishments—storytelling became a way of being safe.

The scene with the chest—wow, what a moment. I've thought about it often.

<a href=""https://boxd.it/5eCrqd"">I watched the miniseries version of this a little over a year ago</a>. The curious viewer may find the total experience of the movie lacking precisely because the film removes some of the careful textures and relationships to arrive at a manageable runtime. Then again, these may just be things I notice because I've seen the full version. The parts I connected to the most from the miniseries were Alexander's flights of fancy, which are only represented here in the tiniest way.

So, while this is still a tremendous film, I prefer the full-length version. That said, despite the title, neither gives much attention to Fanny.

Back home, Ada learns that she will be joined to Bodey Jenkins on the next full moon. Bodey will expect Ada to be a virgin. Ada asks to go to the pit to pray. Instead, she goes to Dawai's shed. Ada sees the kiln running. She pulls out the jug and sees the face carved into it, which is hers. Frightened, she buries the jug.

The next day, she tells her father that she's worried about her joining with Bodey. Her father thinks it's because she might not bear children, and he assures her that the pit will make it right, as it always does.

If you can't tell by the summary, this film is deeply fucked up. The premise is a wild one. The film effectively pulls you into its world with its atmosphere and solid performances. The gore is sufficiently gross for the stuff it pulls.

<blockquote><i>Everything is labeled, but everybody is not.</i></blockquote>

Two actors performing Gounod's opera, Faust, sing ""Il se fait tard! … adieu!"" Newland Archer passively watches from a box seat along with Larry Lefferts and Sillerton Jackson. Lefferts scans the audience with his binoculars, spotting a box where May Welland, her mother, and her cousin, Countess Ellen Olenska, sit. He passes the binoculars to Jackson, both shocked to see Olenska present after her tempestuous marriage to a Polish aristocrat.

Across the way, at the end of the opera's third act, Regina Beaufort rises from her seat. The message is clear to the audience—the annual Beaufort Opera Ball will soon commence. Archer intends to announce his engagement to May Welland at the ball, ideally drawing attention away from Ellen, who has been his friend since childhood. However, since Ellen did not come to the ball, their engagement can only spread through unofficial word-of-mouth.

Beaufort's husband, Julius, did not come from old money as she had; instead, he married into New York society. Though tolerated, he is quietly disliked, especially for his flagrant extramarital affairs. Not that they're happening, but he doesn't follow the other men's suit and keeps it quiet. So, when he and Ellen begin spending time together, the gossip starts. However, Archer, while conventional on the surface, disapproves of this treatment and fights to restore Ellen's honor. So, when Ellen's unconventional views draw Archer in, he finds his idyllic plans and social standing in jeopardy.

<blockquote><i>— Society has a history of tolerating vulgar women.
— To a point.</i></blockquote>

I know this pertains to the book more than the movie, but Wharton herself grew up in this world. If you've ever heard the phrase ""keeping up with the Joneses,"" it is in reference to her father's family. That this film is so faithful to the novel only reinforces the sense that we are experiencing a world once hidden from normies like me.

Like the original book, the film focuses on the intricacies of New York City society at the time—the families and their money, old or new, and the gossip that runs like a black vein underneath its fragile skin, all a labyrinth hidden inside NYC's grid. It's not too dissimilar from Gossip Girl in how gossip carries every action taken in the world of these socialites.

Michael Ballhaus's signature flowing shots take us through decadent homes full of paintings and hardwood. The florid style complements the constant, subdued energy of the socialities. Clever matt paintings and compositions give us the New York City of the 1870s, with dirt roads, horse-drawn carriages, and a sparseness of buildings—it's pretty surreal.

The ""Faust as the market of years"" conceit worked for me.

Scorcese makes his movie fixations more apparent with the contrast from his more contemporary films. We have a protagonist who follows a code of ethics set forward by the world in which he lives—a world of double standards and corrupt morals that pretend otherwise—but finds himself pushing against it at great risk. His love of William Wyler comes through in little ways—it's hard to clarify, but I got <i>The Heiress</i> vibes.

* It's nice to get a rare spotting of Carolyn Farina. It makes sense that her role in <i>Metropolitan</i> would land her in a role like this one.

Greta's dead eyes gaze at the vacant ceiling. Franz von Holstein, her brother and lover, stares into the eyes from which life once came. He remembers SAing her, her begging them to leave together, her promising to be his servant if he caught her, and her falling for Doctor Herbert von Ravensbrück.

Three years pass. Cut to a black carriage carried by black horses. Walter, Herbert's adult son and his wife Eva witness the carriage overturn, and the coachman dies. Inside, they find Greta. They call Dr. Sturges, who checks on her. Sturges finds no heartbeat, though she breathes and moves. She has amnesia, not even knowing her name. Around her neck is a medallion reading ""Greta 1906."" On the back are vague symbols that disturb Sturges.

A maid, Gertrud, recognizes Greta and watches, curious and horrified. She runs back to her room and has a waking nightmare of Franz cutting her neck open. But when she checks on it, the wound has disappeared. Instead, it appears on Greta. Sturges pierces her retina with a needle—she does not flinch. Still, Sturges reports to Walter and Eva that Greta will need some time to recover her memory and that nothing is wrong with her.

What the hell is going on? No, really, what's going on?

This film is Gothic horror on steroids. It discards every iota of subtlety, keeping only the dread and mystery. It's magnetic and unusual. 

Did Klaus Kinski sign up for every movie where he gets to be a sex pest? What a piece of shit. A good portion of his time in this movie is spent pouring vials of different colored liquids into each other.

I like the movie's surreal, dreamy quality. However, I wish the ""mystery"" felt more like a mystery and less like, ""We need something crazy to happen here.""

Anaïs, age 12, watches with disdain her older sister, Elena, age 15, sing a song about finding anyone, including a werewolf, who might love her. They are on vacation with their parents. Later, the two walk into town. Anaïs tells Elena why she can't find anyone who sticks around. Elena remarks on Anaïs's weight as to why she can't even meet anyone. Elena challenges whoever can see the first guy, decent or otherwise. Though Elena hooks up with guys, she doesn't have sex with them. Meanwhile, Anaïs wants to lose her virginity before she meets someone she loves—she doesn't want some guy bragging that he got there first.

They arrive at a cafe, where a college boy named Fernando asks Anaïs to sit down. Through an awkward exchange, Elena sits next to Fernando, and Anaïs sits across from them. Elena orders a coffee, while Anaïs orders a banana split. Elena keeps her eyes fixed on Fernando. She explains that she will be a junior in high school, which only entices Fernando more. The two make out while Anaïs eats her dessert. They leave Anaïs at the restaurant, driving off in Fernando's nice car. Anaïs waits at the gate for her sister's arrival and the two embrace.

Fernando joins them at their vacation house, meeting their parents. Their father talks to Fernando about his plans after college. Elena comments on how out of shape he is, pivoting to Anaïs and her eating habits. Finally, their mother comes to Anaïs's defense, saying her weight is ""hormonal."" Later, everyone sunbathes around the pool except for their father, who takes business calls, and Anaïs, who swims and practices kissing on the stair railing and a wooden dock, switching between the two as though they are two jealous lovers.

That night, Elena puts on makeup in bed, waking up Anaïs. She sneaks Fernando in, who climbs into bed with her. They kiss, and he promises to see her, learn French, and all that. He fails at taking off her bra, so she helps him. But when she clarifies that she won't have sex with him, their dynamic grows more tense and frightening. Anaïs watches, pretending to be asleep.

The film follows that evening and the days that follow on vacation.

<blockquote><i>It's sick that people think it's their business. It's sick being a virgin.</i></blockquote>

If you've seen any from Catherine Breillat, you know she has no problem with sexually explicit imagery. Though several French directors at the time experimented with explicitness, Breillat set the standard, for better or worse. Here, she adds another level of discomfort as we watch in real-time as an adult coerces a 15-year-old into having anal sex with him (Roxane Mesquida, who played Elena, was 20 at the time). Whenever penetrative sex occurs, however, the camera focuses on Anaïs and her response.

The cinematography rides the line between representation and exploitation. Part of the male gaze is the chopping up of women's bodies through the editing process—here, the real-time experience diminishes all sensuality, leaving us with the raw physical experience. It's a perverse feminism, in a way, in that it accurately portrays the victimhood of women under a patriarchal order but conceives of SA as a means of liberation.

The film posits that the disconnected parents, who believe that a vacation in and of itself will resolve all familial tensions, are the root of their children's messed up sense of sexuality. The mother is rigidly aloof but blows up when she feels any sort of disrespect. The father is prone to anger, is always busy with work, and resents his family for not appreciating what he does for them. Let me guess—they grow up hating their mother and longing for their absent father.

Anaïs Reboux was not an actress before this movie and has not done any other film I know. She's incredible in this—she is a perfect example of why so many directors go for non-actors because she makes performance choices that most actors wouldn't. It could be unintentional, but it culminates in a painfully realistic depiction. Like, the way she laughs — I genuinely wondered if she laughed in a take, and they kept it because it feels so organic and aimless in that way a child gets the giggles.

The score is fucking insane. Every time it kicks in, it sounds like a kid's movie. It eventually isn't, but it threw me every time it came in.

The third act is.. like, I can't say a word. I'll say more in the spoiler zone below. Regardless, this movie is a singular experience.


<b>*** SPOILER ZONE ***</b>

I can see the ending as Anaïs's fantasy, in that childish sort of way — her mother and sister, whom she hates at the moment, are murdered, and then a nobody who murdered them takes her virginity, thus fulfilling her wish. Deeply fucked up. I can see someone changing their whole review based on it.","criterion channel, criterion, criterion challenge 2024, cc2024, edited by women, written by women, directed by women, coming-of-age, slow cinema, 1001 movies, new french extremity",2025-03-27

It's just after World War II. Lene Winter drives her friend Nelly Lenz through a border checkpoint from Switzerland to Germany. Nelly sits in the passenger seat, her face wrapped in bloody bandages. The American soldier demands to see Nelly's face. She unwraps it. We don't see, but the soldier apologizes and lets them pass.

In Berlin, Lene takes Nelly to a reconstructive plastic surgeon—a bullet wound to the face that Nelly miraculously survived. The German surgeon asks why a Jewish woman would return to the country. Still, he gives Nelly some face options. Nelly wishes to look like she used to—he tells her that, no matter what, she won't be precisely the same, and perhaps a new face will be an advantage. Still, Nelly does not relent in her wish.

Nelly was a cabaret singer, performing in London up to 1938. Nelly's entire family is dead. As a result, Nelly stands to inherit a substantial sum of money. She asks about Johnny, but Lene refuses to give her anything. Under anesthesia, Nelly dreams of herself, dressed in the Auschwitz prisoner uniform, arriving at the boat house where she hid and seeing Johnny.

While Nelly recovers, Lene finds an apartment in Haifa, where Nelly can see the sea. Nelly doesn't recognize herself in the mirror when the bandages come off. For all intents and purposes, Nelly is dead to the world. In an old photo, she sees herself as she was, but she also sees the dead and the covert Nazis.

The film follows Nelly's search for Johnny and her longing to return to what it once was. It begins at a nightclub called the Phoenix.

The film uses Nelly's changed face to discuss postwar Jewish identity. The German doctor gives Nelly the option to look less Jewish. Lene wants them to travel to Palestine and help create a Jewish state—to ""take back what is theirs"" so they can finally ""be safe."" Johnny, who does not recognize Nelly, asks her to impersonate Nelly and help him claim her inheritance.

Regardless, Nelly has little to no agency in her story. She does not see herself as Jewish anymore, yet dangerous people will see it differently. She carries stories of her experiences in the camp that no one wants to hear. We all have lies about ourselves and others in our heads—molds of what we are willing to see and, more importantly, what we refuse to see. We return to people who hurt us because we want to relive the past—not good, but familiar.

The film consistently plays with mistaken identity. Nelly first finds a different Johnny, who robs her. A soldier at the bar hits on her, only to be told she's the ""wrong girl."" And, of course, despite all evidence to the contrary, Johnny cannot see his wife in the woman who writes like her, fits her clothes and shoes, and has the same-colored eyes.

If you're looking for realism, you'll likely be disappointed. Despite the setting and period, this film functions in the world of metaphor and melodrama. If you can get on board for <i>Vertigo</i>, then this shouldn't be a problem.","criterion channel, criterion, criterion challenge 2024, cc2024, edited by women, identity",2025-03-28

The police have a map of The Casbah of Algiers on the wall. For the past two years, they have searched in vain for Pépé le Moko, an expert thief with a long list of burglaries and robberies. Parisian police don't understand The Casbah—that it is like a labyrinth, with winding, narrow, and interconnecting streets. The cafés are dark and crowded, the population is far more extensive than those who designed the district intended, and the cafés are more multicultural than any Frenchman can fathom. It doesn't help that the criminal networks in The Casbah protect Pépé as they do their own.

Meanwhile, Pépé tries to offload some recently stolen jewels when a busload of cops pour into the district, sending people into their homes to hide. Régis runs to Inès's place, looking for Pépé to warn him. Inès hits the rooftops to reach Pépé. While everyone panics, Pépé keeps his cool and puts together a plan. Meanwhile, Régis tips off the police with the location Inès revealed to him. It turns out that isn't where he is.

In the ensuing shootout, a Parisienne named Gaby finds herself hiding with Inspector Slimane. Pépé retreats over the rooftops and comes down to where Gaby and Slimane hide. Pépé instally falls for Gaby. Inspector Slimane has a personal rule that he'll only pursue Pépé if he tries to flee The Casbah. But Slimane seems to know that date in his heart.

So, Pépé's hiding spot also becomes his prison. With Régis aiding the police, Pépé's partner Pierrot missing, and Pépé's infatuation with Gaby, it seems like it's only a matter of time for ol' Pépé.

It's hard to overstate the influence this movie had, not just on film but on culture. Following WWI, a cultural fatalism set in. The gangster in the film was a criminal whose comeuppance was our catharsis. But here, we have the cynical anti-hero who operates by his own rules, only softened by love, perhaps to his detriment. This is the birth of the cool. The lineage from this to Humphrey Bogart in <i>Casablanca</i> and Jean-Paul Belmondo in <i>Breathless</i> is palpable. This film also operates as the prototype for the film noir, blending the striking contrasts of German Expressionism with poetic realism's sense of disillusionment and applying them to the gangster flick.

The Casbah also became a cultural touchstone—no other film before or after has given this amount of attention to its layout and population, bringing it to life and helping this contemporary viewer understand the ""exoticism"" that Europeans, and later Americans, assigned it.

The sets are so gorgeous! I know they only filmed a little bit on location—nearly everything is shot in the studio. Some deftly placed matte paintings and, baby, you've got a setting. The filmmakers utilized a documentary shooting style when introducing The Casbah, dramatically enhancing the verisimilitude when revisiting those streets and places.

Jean Gabin has such a movie star demeanor—he seems to know that the camera just looking at him is enough to make him look cool. He also delivers his witty dialogue with the carelessness of a Harrison Ford. The dialogue was actually written separately from the screenplay because they wanted to make sure the dialogue popped, and sound was still a relatively new technology in film.

Renée Carl plays the most heartbreaking character — La mére Tarte, once a vaudeville singer but trapped in The Casbah and unable to meet someone who won't beat her up. She lives in her past, and that past's dreams that she will never fulfill. At this point, Carl had a prolific career in the silent era, staring in 185 movies before this one.

If nothing else, it's just so thrilling to watch action-adventure movie troupes form before your eyes. But there's also a disappointment in the deeply misogynist and cruel troupes that it reinforced and propagated for decades after.","criterion channel, criterion, cmc, cmc2017, edited by women, 1001 movies, film noir",2025-03-29

Khat is a plan that is chewed as a recreational stimulant, not too dissimilar from strong coffee. Chewing khat, as a social custom, dates back thousands of years. These customs include religious rituals in Ethiopia, one of the largest producers and exporters of the plant—rituals that we have recorded back to the 14th century. History suggests that the plant originated in the Emirate of Harar.

This documentary goes to Harar to observe the use of khat and how it affects everyone in the area, from those who harvest it to the new generation of Oromo looking for a way out of the hyper-political region.

The filmmaking is less focused on fact-gathering and more on the phenomenological experience of being in this place and experiencing this drug. The monochrome cinematography adds a layer of distance and heightened beauty, mimicking traditional documentary but eschewing its narrative conventions.

Director Jessica Beshir is part-Ethiopian and grew up in Harar following the Ethiopian Civil War. The filmmaking gracefully avoids the ""othering"" chronic in conventional documentary filmmaking, especially about an African city. There are three films on Letterboxd in which Oromo is the primary language. Beshir directed two of them.

By design, this sort of film works best in a theater or somewhere with as few distractions as possible. The pacing is similar to Weerasethakul or Cuaron a la <i>Roma</i>.  The style works against itself in the most poignant moments, where stories are relayed, and the cinematography distances us from the reality of this experience.

Still, this film tells an important, under-told story that deserves an audience.","criterion channel, criterion, criterion challenge 2024, cc2024, solidarity, slow cinema, directed by women, written by women, edited by women",2025-03-29

In the Phillippines, Private Joe Armstrong, a new US Army recruit and nonconformist, drives a military convoy to escort Patricia Hickock, daughter of Colonel Hickock. Down the way, a construction crew forces them to pull over. Armed hijackers emerge from the woods and overtake the convoy. They force Private Madison's head through a window. Armstrong's expression doesn't change. Patricia steps out to complain, and one of the armed men smacks her. Armstrong is ready to kill. Patricia races off to escape but accidentally overturns the car. Armstrong pulls out some punches and kicks. The US soldiers break from their captors and throw punches.

But what's this in the jungle? A ninja. Nay, more ninjas! They leap down and murder most of the US soldiers. More keep coming from nowhere. Armstrong comes from somewhere, knocks away the ninja's arrows, and takes Patricia into the woods. She tries to escape as Armstrong drags her through the jungle — you know, because she's a dumb broad who can't see when she's being saved. Ha ha. When she can't keep up, he breaks the heels off her shoes, splits her skirt, and ties it into shorts. They jump into the river and evade the ninjas.

<blockquote><i>— Who is he?
— I don't know. He's a new recruit.
— He possesses great skills.</i></blockquote>

Back at the US Army base, Colonel Hickock counts the dead bodies coming in. The surviving officers complain about Armstrong and how his heroics got everyone else killed. He asks Corporal Curtis Jackson to explain the bizarre nature of the soldier's wounds. The leader of the ninjas reports back to his boss, Victor Ortega, and tells of the most sacrilegious being: an American ninja. If they're whatever criminal thing is to survive, they must stop him.

<blockquote><i>— Date of birth unknown. Parents, unknown. Next of kin, unknown.
— A construction crew found him on an island in the Pacific six years ago, knocked unconscious by an explosion where they were blasting a road through the jungle. Brought back to the United States with total amnesia.</i></blockquote>

The Universal intro skips and repeats several times. The bell rings at 9 AM on the Loyola University campus, waking up Tree Gelbman. She is painfully hungover in a classmate named Carter's dorm room. Carter's got a <i>They Live</i> poster, an <i>MST3K: The Movie</i> poster, and a <i>Repo Man</i> poster, so he's the love interest and/or the killer. She does the walk of shame, encountering people in particular outfits and getting stuck in memorable moments, so we'll recognize them when this loops later. Tree runs into Tim, who she went on a date with once and now won't leave her alone. She insults his penis size, and he gives her the ""I'm a murder suspect"" face.

Back at her sorority house, her housemate Lori gives Tree a rundown of all the debaucherous shit she did last night before giving her a birthday cupcake she made from scratch. Because Tree hasn't learned the true meaning of Christmas or whatever, she throws the cupcake away. She enters class late, eye-fucking her professor. Later, she tries to fuck him in his office, but his wife shows up and interrupts. That night, she heads to a party. Going through a tunnel, she sees a music box playing Happy Birthday. A guy in a baby mask chases her down and stabs her.

She wakes up in the morning and is in Carter's dorm, hungover and annoyed at herself for ending up here again. But as more things happen to her — those things I mentioned earlier — she realizes she's experienced them all before.

<b>Algiers 1957</b>
French Army soldiers stand around a stripped and shaken compatriot of Ali La Pointe, a commander of the Algerian National Liberation Front (FLN). The soldiers are happy that, after grueling torture, they were able to make him reveal the location of La Pointe's hideout. They dress him in French Army fatigues, forcing him to come with them to ensure he isn't lying, and then he can go free. The Army raids La Pointe's home in The Casbah, running over rooftops and sending people out in droves. The compatriot points to a false wall behind which Mahmoud, Halima, Little Omar, and Ali La Pointe sit.

<b>The Casbah 1954</b>

<blockquote><i>People of Alegeria, our combat is directed against colonialism. Our aim: independence and restoration of the Algerian state, in accordance with Islamic principles and the respect of basic liberties, regardless of race or religion. To avoid bloodshed, we propose that the French authorities negotiate with us our right to self-determination. Algerians, it is your duty to save your country and restore its liberty. Its victory will be yours. Forward, brothers! Unite! The FLN calls you to arms.</i></blockquote>Ali La Pointe has done what he has to do to survive. He was in and out of juvie from age 12 onward for things like vandalism and public disturbances. At 19, he did eight months in prison for insulting a police officer. He's done his fair share of physical labor, from boxing to bricklaying. Now, the police are bringing him in again. They also bring in an FLN commandeer and execute him by beheading. 

In the five months La Pointe spent in prison, the FLN politically radicalized La Pointe. Little Omar brings him a note, which La Pointe has him read because he is illiterate. The note orders La Pointe to murder a police officer who gets his information from a nearby informant. A woman in white hands La Pointe the revolver, but when he points it at the policeman, he finds the gun empty. La Point chases the woman in white, who leads him to FLN commander El-hadi Jafar. Jafar explains the intentions behind the setup and his plan to organize the FLN.

From here, the film branches off to multiple perspectives as it details The Battle of Algiers, which occurred during the Algerian War of Independence. The film also gives us the French perspective, doing its best to show both sides of the war:

<blockquote><i>We're neither madmen nor sadists. Those who call us fascists forget the role many of us played in the Resistance. Those who call us Nazis don't know that some of us survived Dachau and Buchenwald. We are soldiers. Our duty is to win.</i></blockquote>Pontecorvo wanted this film to feel like a documentary, so he and cinematographer Marcello Gatti copied newsreel styles and documentary-esque editing. They also hired non-professional actors who had lived through the battle. The zooms have become such a cliche in TV and movies, but here, they feel revelatory in how they cut into the cinematic barrier. At the time, American releases noted that the film contained no actual newsreels.

Pontecorvo worked with Ennio Morricone on the score as a final bit of brilliance. Morricone deftly keeps his score in the background, keeping time more than adding triumph. But his Theme of Ali — dude, it sounds like ""Born Slippy"" by Underworld!

In <a href=""https://boxd.it/9gnFsH"" rel=""nofollow"">a review for <i>Pépé le Moko</i></a>, I said that that film brought The Casbah to life more than any film I've seen. This one goes further, but having seen <i>Pépé le Moko</i>, seeing familiar streets and rooftops added another layer of realism to this movie.

Costa-Gavras's <i>Z</i> felt similar to me, and it makes sense—Costa-Gavras cites this film as an influence. From <i>Children of Men</i> to <i>Dunkirk</i>, this film remains a touchstone for contemporary directors who want to make their war films feel more ""real."" Even Stanley Kubrick, who faked the moon landing, was duped by this movie!

And I can see why — the film still hits! The action is tense, the cinematography is dynamic, and the pacing is measured, bordering on blazing. Do you know what makes an explosion feel more real? If it just fucking happens, no slo-mo, no score sting.

The Pentagon has screened this movie to help commanders and troops better understand the guerilla warfare they faced in occupied Iraq.

It's rare to see a movie that acts as such a benchmark for filmmaking—this one changed movies from then on.","criterion channel, criterion, criterion challenge 2024, cc2024, 1001 movies, sight and sound, golden lion, solidarity",2025-03-31

Rain falls in the American Southwest. Mark Preston returns home. His mother, Emma, cites the same dream she has every night—it begins with a storm. But Mark doesn't want to hear it. Dogs bark outside. They run out to find Mark's father, Steve, his eyes gouged out, his face melting. Corbis. Book. The desert. Redstone. Give Corbis the book. Steve melts in the rain. 

Emma runs to a hiding place and retrieves the book, telling Mark to bring it to Corbis, but Mark won't give the devil what he wants. In the hiding spot is also a leather bag containing an amulet—if Mark wears it, Corbis can't hurt him. Mark leaves her with family friend John. Before he reaches the car, he hears Emma scream. He runs inside to find John hanging from his feet, the house overturned, and Emma abducted. Quoting future movie star Arnold Schwarzenegger, Mark says, ""I'll be back,"" and hits the road.

Mark arrives in a ghost town. Like a dork, he tries to pump water from a decrepit pump and gets a nice fist full of sand. A man approaches and makes the pump give water. Though bitter, Mark drinks it down. The man is Corbis. And he wants the book. Mark challenges Corbis to a battle of faith. If Mark wins, he gets his family back. If he loses, Corbis receives the book and Mark. 

Will Mark's devout Christianity stop Corbis's devout Satanism? What is this book, and why should we care? 

Boy, this movie is slow. I tried to watch the Job Bob version of this, but the interruptions killed any momentum the movie attempted to build up. The melting Steve makes a promise that the movie waits for AGES to follow through on. I didn't hate the in-between, but it's hard to discuss because not much happens. You can phase out until Ernest Borgnine turns into a devil/goat thing, which is the beginning of the third act.

This movie converted John Travolta to Scientology. Well, not the movie, but his co-star Joan Prather gave him a copy of Dianetics, and the rest is history.

Mr. Satanist Anton LaVey makes an appearance, along with his wife, Diane.

Hossain Farazmand, a journalist for Sorush magazine, leaves the police station with two officers. In the taxi, Farazmand relays to the taxi driver the unusual story of Hossain Sabzian, who has been impersonating Iranian director Mohsen Makhmalbaf. According to Farazman, Sabzian, who is acting as Makhmalbaf, hired a family to be actors and set up their house as the filming location for his next film. No one knows why Sabzian is doing this—is he stealing from the family? Farazmand thinks this could be an international story, so they will arrest him and get the details.

When they arrive at the gated home, Farazmand goes in alone so as not to spook Sabzian. The father of the family, Abolfazl Ahankhah, comes out with his formal complaint to the officers, and they go in to arrest Sabzian. The police come out with Sabzian in cuffs, Farazmand getting several photos. The cab drives ahead to the police station. Farazmand then goes knocking door-to-door to see if anyone has a tape recorder—if he can't get Sabzain's story on tape, what's the point? After much searching, he finally nabs one and runs to the police station.

""Bogus Makhmalbaf Arrested."" So reads the headline in Sorush, which intrigues filmmaker Abbas Kiarostami. Kiarostami goes to the prison to get more details—where the Ahankhah house is, what kind of person Sabzian is, and so on. Kiarostami then interviews Abolfazl and Mahrokh Ahankhah, who seem to feel like they had a handle on Sabzian before Farazmand showed up. And so Kiarostami brings us into his metafiction surrounding the events.

The film is based on actual events, and everyone in it plays themselves. Many scenes are reenactments that set up the actual trial, which Kiarostami also filmed for this movie. Kiarostami may have filmed interviews as they occurred, or they could be reenactments of interviews that Kiarostami conducted (especially with the Ahankhahs, who seem apprehensive of Kiarostami's intentions despite appearing earlier in the film).

Kiarostami became interested in Sabzian because Sabzian was a self-proclaimed film lover. Sure enough, when Kiarostami visited him in prison, Sabzian was familiar with Kiarostami's work and surprised that he would take an interest in him.

In learning Sabzian's story, we understand why he plays a different director instead of being one himself: he was born into a social class that would never offer him the opportunity. A filmmaker may speak for his class like Makhmalbaf's <i>The Cyclist</i> did for Sabzian. But despite Sabzian's ambitions, it could only ever be a performance. This film allowed him to play that role with a camera.

Despite all these meta-layers, the film is surprisingly simple in its structure. It isn't trying to fool you—it only asks you to question the mechanisms and artificiality of the filmmaking process. Hossain Sabzian happens to be the perfect vehicle for this conversation.

The final scene is such an incredible moment. I was tearing up throughout. ","criterion channel, criterion, criterion challenge 2022, cc2022, solidarity, 1001 movies, sight and sound, village voice",2025-04-01

<b>Sicily 1486</b>
Five crucifixes line the walls of a chamber. In the center is a porthole that looks down into a pile of bones. Pagan and esoteric symbols line the walls. A village mob drags five nuns into the chamber against their will, binding them to the crucifixes. Once bound, they hammer nails into each of their chests, killing them, and leave their bodies in the chamber.

<b>Toronto 1990</b>
Four people sit around a table holding a seance. Sweat stains their faces, each in a trance. Liza opens her eyes, seeing the tortured nuns before fainting. She awakens under the care of archaeologist Professor Evans, who chastises her for attending the seance. The two lead a survey team to Ancient Greek ruins in Santa Rosalia, Sicily. On a hill overlooking the ruins is a centuries-old monastery. Liza leaves the dig and investigates, but Paul catches up so he can make fun of her. Liza feels as though something is still living inside.

The mayor of Santa Rosalia, Mr. Buscemi, visits the dig, warning them of the locals' aversion to the dig. They believe the dead should be allowed to rest in peace. Others in the area confirm that the locals will kill to preserve whatever secrets the monastery keeps. So, what does Liza do? She enters the monastery and finds the walls lined with remains, bound and contorted. In her mind, Liza sees the tortured nuns hidden behind a fresco. She breaks down the walls, finding the remains of the crucified nuns.

If only Liza knew what she had unleashed on all of them. What secrets may undo what she's done? Or is it too late for all of them?

Depending on who you ask, Demonia is either the last great Fulci or the beginning of the end. It carries many of his trademarks: a woman dedicated to the truth, a manipulative man to foil her and gross-out gore and visuals.

The film contrasts the Dark Ages with classical antiquity. Paul is obsessed with light, enlightenment, and reason, whereas Liz finds the religious, spiritual, and supernatural compelling.

The first act is pretty compelling, but the second act goes into vibe territory—lots of whistful staring off, walking about, and dreams. Still, we get a wild cat attack, a baby being set on fire, and plenty more.

The worst part of the movie is when they have singalongs around the fire. It happens more than once, and it's just tedious. It drives Liza insane, too. Just learn a third chord, dude!

Fulci appears as the police inspector. I love the gruff voice of whoever dubbed him.

While this isn't Fulci at his most cuckoo, it's still sufficiently deranged and entertaining.","shudder, cmc, cmc2017, nunsploitation",2025-04-02

<blockquote><i>Don't worry, miss. We're all decent folks.</i></blockquote>

The convent bells ring. The Mother Superior calls for Viridiana to inform her that her uncle, Don Jaime, will not come to see her take her vows. He is in poor health, and the Mother Superior suggests she say her final goodbyes to him before becoming a nun. Though Viridiana does not wish to see the outside world again, she obeys her Mother Superior's wishes. Viridiana arrives at Don Jaime's decrepit mansion, where he lives with his servant, Ramona, and Ramona's daughter, Rita. Don Jaime comments on how Viridiana resembles her aunt and his late wife, down to her walk and voice.

One night, Don Jaime opens a dresser at the end of his bed, where he keeps his wife's wedding dress and veil. He tries on the shoes and wraps the corset around himself before Viridiana passes through. Sleepwalking, she throws her knitting in the fire and fills the basket with ash from the fire. She pours the ash on his bed and wanders back to her room.

Viridiana's final day comes. Don Jaime asks if she could wear her aunt's wedding dress. She says no, but she reluctantly goes through with it. Don Jaime then asks her to marry him and never leave the house. The question horrifies Viridiana, but Don Jaime puts on music and offers her a coffee. Viridiana reluctantly takes the coffee, which Don Jaime has drugged. Rita watches from the shadows as Don Jaime takes the passed-out Viridiana to the bedroom.

Don Jaime's plot to possess Viridiana takes dark and strange turns. It is impossible to predict where it will lead, but it involves Don Jaime's illegitimate son, Jorge, and a band of beggars.

The film is difficult to parse. It feels like a morality tale, but it doesn't seem to condone or condemn anyone in particular. Everyone makes choices—even with the best intentions, those choices might be mistakes or not have the whole picture in mind.

For example, Jorge sees a cart pass with a dog tied to the wheel. The dog cannot stop when the cart is moving, or else it chokes. So, Jorge purchases the dog to save it. The dog wishes to return to its original owner but cannot. And when they walk off, another cart passes with another dog tied underneath.

Similarly, Viridiana wishes to help a group of beggars by offering them a place to stay. In doing so, she exemplifies Christian charity, but she also reduces these people to entities that she can control—obey my rules, and I will care for you. This occurs in tandem with Jorge's work to renovate the crumbling mansion.

In this way, Viridiana and Jorge both represent shortsightedness. Jorge is only concerned with his own material interests and finds it foolish to care about anyone else's needs but his own. Viridiana is doing a good deed, but all while living alongside Jorge. It is like a shantytown next to a renovated downtown center—who does this help?

Some people read the film to suggest that you should never show charity to anyone because people are animals. While I can certainly see that perspective, I think it misses the movie in total. This movie is one I'll have to revisit and consider more because I still feel like I only scratched the surface.","criterion channel, criterion, criterion challenge 2022, cc2022, palme d'or winner, 1001 movies",2025-04-02

A boy and several men herd cows through the arid plains of Dakar to a slaughterhouse. The cows slip on the blood and gore-smeared floors as the men slit their throats and hang their bodies to drain blood.

Anta does schoolwork to the tune of babies crying. Unlike the boubou and manjak that the other women wear, Anta wears pants and a button-up shirt. Just blocks away, the high-rises of urban expansion lord over them. Aunt Oumy sells produce outside the house—when a woman comes by, promising to pay them back in the future, Anta steps up in defense. Both Oumy and the woman see it as a sign of disrespect. Anta leaves to meet up with Mory, whom Oumy sees as good-for-nothing, as he has no job and rides his bull-horn-adorned motorcycle everywhere.

Speaking of which, Mory arrives at the school to pick up Anta. Some other students, Marxists ready for the next revolution, see Mory and think he's there to spy on them, so they tie him up and drag him to their car. The film juxtaposes one of the students pulling the horns off of Mory's motorcycle and men in the village slaughtering a goat. They tie Mory to their car and parade him around the city. Somewhere, Anta runs, presumably to Mory. She arrives at his bike and removes her clothes. The camera looks down, not at Mory, but at the goat, kicking and belting as the men slit its throat and drain its blood into a loose door panel. 

Cut to Aunt Oumy dressing the goat. Anta arrives, looking for Mory. Oumy claims Mory threw himself off the cliff. We see Anta running again, on the exact steps we saw before, on the same cliffside. Oumy's laughter rings out and echoes, blending with electronic squeals. Images of the goat thrashing as it bleeds out are intercut with waves dashing against the rocks. She arrives at the bike, removes her clothes, and kneels to the ground, out of sight. We hear tears, but seeing Anta's hands gripping the back of Mory's motorcycle, the tears blend with sighs of pleasure.

Mory knows of a boat leaving tomorrow for Paris. Neither has any money to their name, but if they can steal money from somewhere and tip off the right people, they might be able to escape to their dream.

The film came out in a tumultuous time for Senegal, which achieved independence along with the Republic of Mali (then French Sudan) in 1960. In the following decades, the country would face coups and border violations from the Portuguese military. Though Wolof is the most commonly spoken native language, especially in Dakar, French is still its official language. In this way, the film explores Senegal's post-independence disenchantment with our two leads, who do whatever they can to escape their world of tradition.

Critics saw the film as a radical departure in storytelling and filmmaking from most African films of the time. Some cite the French New Wave as an influence, while others see it more closely aligned with the shifts in space and time in African oral tradition. Regardless, the film's experimentation with structure and juxtaposition is captivating, even with grotesque animal violence in the mix.

Touki Bouki is Wolof for The Journey of the Hyena. Bouki, the hyena, is a popular folk character in Senegalese traditions—a mischief-maker who cheats his way to success. Is Mory the hyena who steals to get what he wants—is Capitalism's promise of happiness to those who know how to exploit its rules?

My biggest issue with the movie is the animal violence. I understand its place culturally and am not saying it shouldn't be there — it's just brutal and stomach-wrenching.

The gay character is quite silly, but I don't know if the film is making fun of him because he never comes across negatively—he's just disappointed that boys make plans with him and bail.","criterion channel, criterion, criterion challenge 2022, cc2022, solidarity, sight and sound",2025-04-04

Shinichi Ichikawa is a third-grade teacher who gives kids the creeps. We meet him sewing a zebra costume while watching Radioactive Ranger, where the Ranger fights Sadako, the girl from The Ring. That night, he dons the zebra costume he was making. But it's no ordinary zebra costume—it is the costume of the 70s tokusatsu character Zebraman, a show that only lasted seven episodes before being canceled.

At school, a transfer student named Shinpei Asano joins Shinichi's third-grade class. Shinichi instantly falls in love with Shinpei's mother, Kana. Shinichi catches Shinpei drawing on his desk—it's of Zebraman—and the two bond, inspiring Shinichi to don his costume and surprise Shinpei that evening. While out, he hears a woman scream and runs to her rescue. As Zebraman, he runs into the crab-mask serial killer. Mid-fight, Shinichi discovers he has superpowers.

The fight triggers a blip on the radar of two special agents, Segawa and Oikawa. When they investigate, they find the crab-masked man with a fist-sized hole in his face and an alien goo bubbling out of it. As Zebraman fights more baddies, they all seem to have this alien goo. What's going on? Will Zebraman be able to stop it?

Despite whatever subtext you might read, this movie is predominantly a love letter to tokusatsu, with its weird creatures, secret military meetings, and alien invasions. The film makes several references—we even get to watch a clip from an episode of Zebraman, and it is delightful. 

Like every Miike movie I've seen, this one is too long. I felt the pace early as the dialogue dragged and story beats took multiple scenes to develop. The inciting incident doesn't happen until nearly 40 minutes in—fine for most movies but rough for an action comedy,

That said, the comedy translates well and many of the jokes land for someone who doesn't speak Japanese. They're not riotous, but I chuckled a few times. The Zebranurse theme is excellent. The George Bush joke is odd.

The movie's message seems to be, ""Yes, nerds, you are pathetic. But your obscure knowledge may save us all."" And that's because the filmmakers didn't think about the message. Or if they did, it got lost along the way.

Carrie Wink is a hotshot helicopter pilot for hire in the highrise metropolis of LA. She and her detective husband, Gordon, have perfectly competent softcore sex, but Carrie wants a baby.

Fairfax is a criminal mastermind who loves to quote Shakespeare at inappropriate times. He and his cronies are after some circuit boards that, when connected, will somehow change everything.

Carrie charters Fairfax to the Zitex building, unaware of his plans to take the place hostage and obtain the final circuit board. Looks like it's up to Carrie to save the day. And don't worry, if you thought it would be illogical for Carrie to know how to use a gun, we cut back to a scene where her husband teaches her to shoot and then gropes her enormous breasts.

<a href=""https://boxd.it/5Pl08Z"" rel=""nofollow"">After watching To the Limit</a>, I hoped for a similar experience here. While both movies are awful, this one makes the mistake of trying to Die Hard, putting much of the movie's action in Anna Nicole Smith's hands. She commits to the role and gives it her all, but I felt sympathy for all they ask of her more than anything.

This movie also has an SA scene that seems only to exist to follow the rules of comedy and show Smith's breasts a third time. It’s a deeply upsetting scene, which I guess props to the filmmakers because SA should be upsetting onscreen.

Charles M. Huber is such a wacko as Fairfax that we couldn't tell what accent he was trying to imitate. Looking it up, he's a German politician in real life, and he was trying to imitate a South African accent, which is hard enough without the endless supply of Shakespeare quotes.

The first act was so entertaining, and the movie fell off hard, making this a more unpleasant than enjoyable watch. It has moments throughout, but this one is bad enough that I'd reserve it for folks with a high tolerance for crap or people who have no reservations about making fun of Anna Nichole Smith (which excluded us).","tubi, cmc, cmc2017, my kyle, holly",2025-04-05

A masked man ushers us past stage lights. A door begins to unlock, but…

<blockquote><i>Every poem is a coat of arms. It must be deciphered. Nothing but blood and tears in exchange for these axes, faces, unicorns, torches, towers, blackbirds, half-stars, and fields of azure!</i></blockquote>

We arrive at Act 1 of 4: The Wounded Hand, or The Scars of the Poet. The shirtless artist sketches a face— the camera focused on his back tattoo of a star, obscured by a scar. Suddenly, the face begins to move. Horrified, the artist smears out the mouth, only to find it transferred to his hand. After using the hand to pleasure himself, he thinks of new applications, drawing him into dangerous explorations of art as the abjection from our psychological wounds.

1930 was a transitional time for film. Here, we have a film that combines silent and talkie methods—cards for the dialogue but synchronized sound and score. The hand transferred to the artist's hand can speak. The film has a narrator.

Féral Benga's appearance in the film is satisfying. His androgynous look is perfect for the guardian angel role. And it's fascinating to see Lee Miller in her only movie role—I understand why so many artists went gaga over her.

Visually, the film is a masterwork. Its editing is precise yet, at times, interpretive. The black-and-white is rich and dynamic. The compositions are compelling and innovative.

A full moon and a wolf's howl — Jonathan and Nina's voices carry out into the night. Jonathan comments on Nina's pale, luminescent beauty. Nina comments on Jonathan's beautiful neck. But before she can bite, Peter Vincent, a vampire killer, comes after her.

 All this comes from the television playing in Charley Brewster's bedroom. Charley isn't watching the TV, though—he's kissing his girlfriend, Amy. But when Fright Night theatre host Peter Vincent comes onscreen, Amy stops him so they can watch. After repeated no's, Charlie doesn't care and tries to get fresh with Amy. After a disagreement, Amy pulls Charlie to bed. But Charlie isn't interested in sex now because outside, he sees two people carrying a coffin into the house next door. Amy, hurt and confused, storms out of the house. On the local news downstairs, the TV reports a missing person.

The following night, Charley sees a beautiful woman enter the house next door. While studying, he hears a scream. He looks across the way to the house next door. The lights cut off. On the news, he sees a report about a second murder. The woman on the screen is the woman he saw entering the house next door. That night, he watches the house through binoculars. He sees the new neighbor with another woman. And then he sees fangs form in the neighbor's mouth. Charlie tries to get the police to intervene, but when he makes his vampire theory known, he finds himself alone, the neighbor aware of him.

Is Charley dealing with vampires? Will his ridiculous friend, Evil Ed, or his angry but secretly hopeful girlfriend, Amy, help him?

The film takes the teenager raised on Vincent Price and Hammer Horror and puts him in an awfully familiar situation. However, the film is sharp in its subjective lens, not giving us a definitive yes but no reason to doubt Charley's suspicions.

The neighbor, Jerry Dandrige, lives with his familiar, Billy Cole. The film all but says the subtext: Jerry and Billy are a gay couple, striking fear into the devout neighbors and narrowly avoiding the dangers of being outed. 

Chris Sarandon brought the humor out of his villain, choosing to have Dandridge all but say he's a vampire to throw off the trail and eat fruit in several scenes because he has ""fruit bat in his DNA."" He's also super hot, so he pulls off seductive vampire effortlessly.

Wyatt and Billy pull up to La Contenta Bar in Mexico. There, they meet a cocaine dealer, trying the stuff before buying. In LA, they meet with a wealthy buyer. Wyatt counts the money, and the two ride off in their truck. Back at the garage, Wyatt stuffs the cash into plastic tubes and puts the tubes into his chopper's Stars & Stripes fuel tank. Billy gets on his flame-themed chopper, and the two ride east to New Orleans.

The film follows the boys on the trip and the folks they meet along the way: a hitchhiker who brings them to a hippie commune, a square lawyer who joins the trip to New Orleans, and women whose sole purpose in the film is to fuck the men.

The film aims to be a modern Western, with Wyatt named after Wyatt Earp and Billy after Billy the Kid. Their Wild West is the world of drugs and performative counterculturalism. The soundtrack is wall-to-wall '60s rock: Steppenwolf, The Band, Jimi Hendrix, etc. The actors use the drugs depicted—no fake stuff.

The performances are solid. Jack Nicholson's uptight lawyer, George Hanson, is unconvincing but entertaining. Dennis Hopper looks and acts like he's perpetually on the supply. Karen Black is perfect and has never done anything wrong.

The best part of the movie is the cinematography. Hopper, who is also a photographer, encouraged cinematographer László Kovács to use natural light when possible. The flickering transitions contrast well with the long shots of the boys riding through the countryside and the impromptu-feeling shots of wandering through the city. The LSD scene is the movie's pinnacle.

Ultimately, the film feels like boys in Hollywood wanting to make an exploitation flick. Hopper tried to bring the movie to Roger Corman to produce, but Hopper scared off potential buyers. So, they took the project to Bert Schneider and Bob Rafelson, who created The Monkees.

I'm sure the movie was exciting for all the trust-fund babies and rebellious upper-class kids it depicts. Today, however, the movie is a time capsule of a particular brand of self-indulgence that still draws in libertarians and the occasional teenager despite its obvious indictment of counterculture's self-destructive tendencies. Or maybe I'm giving the filmmakers too much credit.","criterion, criterion challenge 2022, cc2022, 1001 movies, bikesploitation, drugsploitation, hippiesploitation",2025-04-07

It's the 1930s. Eve walks into her apartment. On her bed, she sees burn marks. Pulling back the sheets, she finds the outline of a person made from the burn marks. Three men leave the shadows and break a picture on an end table. They're looking for the man in the photo named Noodles. When Eve answers that she doesn't know, they shoot her. The men continue their search, beating Fat Moe bloody. Fat Moe gives up Noodle's location: Chun Lo's Chinese theatre, which has an opium den in the back.

There, we find Noodles on his back in an opium daze. Next to him is a newspaper about three bootleggers slain by the feds. He hears a phone ringing and sits up. A man hands Noodles the opium pipe and tells him to lie down. Noodles looks into the lamp, and we transition back in time. Rain falls as firefighters put out an overturned truck fire and line up three dead men for the coroner. Noodles looks from the crowd: they are the same dead men we saw in the newspaper. The phone is still ringing.

Cut to a prohibition-era nightclub. Noodles crosses the floor to his office. He picks up the phone. The phone is still ringing. He dials a number, and we see the phone of Sgt. P. Halloran. The phone comes off the receiver. The phone is still ringing. It erupts into a siren, waking Noodles from his opium trance. The three men hunting for Noodles enter the theater. The theater people help Noodles escape out the back. He arrives the following day at the place where the three beat up Fat Moe. One still stands over Fat Moe's body. Noodles calls the elevator but then sneaks around back, killing the man and grabbing the keys to Eve's. But Fat Moe tells him it's too late. The other key is to a lockbox at the train station.

Noodles opens the lockbox and takes out the briefcase. He looks inside and only finds newspapers. So, Noodles buys a one-way ticket on the first bus leaving. He sees a painted advertisement for Coney Island, a glass door underneath. He walks up to the glass door and sees himself white-haired and wrinkled. A symphonic rendition of Yesterday by The Beatles plays. Noodles steps away from the door, and the ad is now a LOVE-themed ad for the Big Apple. He rents a car and drives to the Beth Israel cemetery, where a construction crew digs up the old graves. He calls up Fat Moe, and the two converse over J&B. It turns out the men looking for Noodles found him in hiding after thirty-odd years.

Throughout the film, we move through time, the future, and the past to see how Noodles and three of his friends became involved in the Jewish mob and how everything crumbled. It starts with a suitcase that once contained money—who took it?

The film uses things like windows and mirrors as gateways to different points in time, starting in the 1930s, moving to the 1960s, and then returning to 1918, where it all began.

I like it when the kids whistle Ennio Morricone's score. It's weird when Cockeye plays it on the pan flute. The score itself is pretty good—it sounds like someone put The Godfather's score through a pan-flute synth patch.

The casting for young DeNiro and young James Woods is pretty perfect. Whether intended or not, the actors play them with homoerotic chemistry.

There are two graphic scenes of SA—one with a zany, Tinto Brass quality. The other is long and horrifying. The first rewarded Noodles with attention from a woman he wasn't interested in, so like a child who became a man in prison, he learned a life lesson. Based on that lesson, the second destroyed any hope he had of being with someone he loved. While there are myriad ways to communicate this, the film chose these unforgivable acts to remind you how sick and dangerous this guy is. Ultimately, it doesn't amount to much to the story, so…

The film makes many mobster troupes more explicit, saying what is usually understood out loud. Early in, Noodles tells Max that when you're helping folks double-cross, that double-cross will soon be on you.

In some ways, the movie also goes against some troupes. For example, Noodles is never on board for any of it. He's always the voice of dissent, yet he still ends up part of it. The film goes out of its way to railroad Noodles. Or maybe that's how he remembers it.

<blockquote><i>— It wasn't my choice.
— Yes, it was. It still is.</i></blockquote>

<b>Borgo San Guiliano, Rimini, Italy</b>
<blockquote><i>When the puffballs come, then winter's almost gone. When the puffballs soar, then winter is no more.</i></blockquote>

The village people celebrate the arrival of the floating poplar seeds, swimming through the air, touching all walks of life: rich or poor, tourist or local, living or dead. Their arrival marks the beginning of spring, which the townspeople will celebrate that night with a bonfire. At night, they bring stray wood, old furniture, and whatever else, atop which they set the segavecchia, an effigy of an old witch symbolizing the dying winter. Musicians play, and kids set off fireworks as the fire burns. Once it ceases and folks return home, a lawyer arrives in the town square on a bike. The lawyer tells the camera about the town's history, going back to ancient times but recorded as early as 268 BCE. The townspeople are as irreverent as they are generous. Fart noises interrupt the lawyer, and he leaves.

Cut to picture day at school. A boy flirts with Aldina. Gigliozzi scares a girl with a frog. The class contains three pictures: Pope Pius XI, King Victor Emmanuel III, and Benito Mussolini. The teacher shows the students a stone hanging from a rope and asks the kids to identify it. Another teacher quizzes Titta on where Tiberius retired when giving up his command of the Roman empire. Like a preacher, one teacher talks of the reconciliation between the church and state through Jesus Christ. The kids goof off, sometimes in elaborate and choreographed ways, such as piping several rolled pieces of paper into a funnel that terminates at the teacher's feet and urinates into it.

And so the film continues in its series of episodes. While the film has no overarching narrative, the episodes have overlapping characters—avatars for whatever bits of story the film tells—and the passing of the seasons.

Fellini's dream-like recollection of his childhood blends the minutiae of daily life with a surreal, larger-than-life sense of possibility. The classroom scenes remind me of <i>Zero for Conduct</i>, but with a stronger sense of choreography. In many ways, the film is a set of lies — the events are tied to Fellini's upbringing but intentionally misremembered. We are not getting Fellini's actual childhood, but vignettes that chase the emotional associations Fellini had with it.

People often talk about Fellini's movies as a circus, the way he coordinates large groups into freewheeling acts that somehow feel impromptu and well-rehearsed. Unbound from an overarching narrative, this film epitomizes that sentiment. The children are clowns, cutting into the sincerity of any moment, but so are the Fascist teachers and officials. The town nympho is a roaring lion daring the men to tame her. Titta's father, Aurelio, is a bear who cannot tolerate deviation from his routine.

The lawyer returns at points to address the camera, like Bob Balaban in <i>Moonrise Kingdom</i>, except without any ulterior purpose beyond trying to put truth to the chaos onscreen and failing.

Of course, Fascism runs throughout the film. The Fascist leaders enter the city like Olympians, lauded by the public with hearty cheers. Their fixations on the rule of law take on absurdity as they demand Aurelio prove his loyalty by drinking castor oil as a toast to a Fascist victory.

The sky lights up as two glowing entities crash into the foggy Thai highlands. A woman's baby gives an unusual cry. She comes over to its crib to see it covered in ants. She looks up to see the ceiling covered with thousands of ants. They drop to the floor in swarms, chasing the woman as she runs outside with her baby. The swarm reaches her ankle, bringing her down and sending her baby sliding across the floor. Ants swim up her legs and cover her body, eating her down to the bone. They migrate to the baby, give it a once-over, and eat it.

The ant swarm takes over Thailand, killing as it goes. Dr. Claire Dubois, a world-leading hymenopterist, comes on the breaking news segment to explain why ants attack people. She describes their intelligence and self-sacrificing tendencies. Thorax Industries CEO Horace Lennart, AKA Len, comes on to counter Dr. Dubois, saying that ants are just big balls of instinct. The reporter hints that the two have a past. Sure enough, Horace calls Dr. Dubois to invite her out for her expertise after the interview.

<blockquote><i>Okay, folks, let's liquify some, uh, indoskeletons.</i></blockquote>

The Thorax team packs their gear and prepares to take on the invading ants. But the ant swarm is much larger than they could have imagined. So, Thorax pulls out their sci-fi weapons and vaporize these fuckers. Things seem to be going well, but the comms between them and the base are in and out. Len and Bill turn around and see a floating, snake-like entity made entirely of ants. Rather than kill it, they follow it, losing total connection with comms. Oops! It was a trap set by ants! So, an ant trap? Thankfully, the sci-fi guns only hurt ants, not humans, so Len can blow them away when millions pour on them. But he misses one that climbs into Bill's ear and brain. It seems as though the ant has taken control of Bill.

What are these unusual ants? How are they flying around? Why?

The film moves quickly, letting ideas develop quickly. The filmmakers made this movie for Sci-Fi, so they knew that the audience was going to be impatient with creature feature troupes. But it's also made for TV, so they know people are only going to pay attention half-heartedly. So, things also get explained out loud to the folks looking at their phones at the time.

I do not understand why the filmmakers are trying to obscure that they filmed this in Thailand. They say it's a Southeast Asian country but call it an ""island."" I don't know why it annoys me so much, but color me annoyed!

The result isn't necessarily bad. The CGI is goofy, the acting is whatever, and the set pieces are pretty interesting. Tom Wopat compellingly depicts a guy getting his brain eaten by an ant. Elizabeth Healey is having a rough time with her American accent—she could be Cara Seymour's doppelganger. The movie never pretends to aim for anything higher than middle-of-the-road. I also have to give the film some props for killing a baby, even if they do it offscreen.

<b>Italy, Spring of 1866. The last months of the Austrian Occupation of the Veneto.</b>

<blockquote><i>The Italian government has forged a pact with Prussia, and the war of liberation is imminent.</i></blockquote>

A performance of ""Di quella pira"" from Verdi's <i>Il trovatore</i> fills a lush opera house. The aria ends with a call to arms, which cues Italian revolutionaries in the crowd to drop leaflets in Italy's flag colors and demand the occupying Austrian officers leave Italy. The scene draws cheers from some and silence from the Austrians. Count Serpieri demands action while his wife, Countess Livia Serpieri, observes the unfolding chaos. From the crowd, Roberto Ussoni, her cousin and protest organizer, throws her a small red, white, and green bouquet. Austrian Lieutenant Franz Mahler jokes about Italian forms of protest, drawing Roberto's ire, and he calls for a duel. Franz leaves as the Austrian soldiers hold back Roberto and his collaborators.

Livia runs to the lobby to find Roberto. Livia finds Roberto and asks him to go into hiding and wait until she sends word. The opera continues, and Livia does her best to protect Roberto, suggesting a rivalry over women between him and Franz. Livia asks to meet Franz. When he arrives, she hints that she despises melodrama anywhere but on stage. More directly, she asks him not to duel. But Franz is not interested in dueling, only imprisoning the agitprop distributors. Sure enough, when she goes to check on Roberto, he and three others have been arrested and condemned to a year of exile.

When Franz sees Livia again, he pursues her despite her wishes otherwise. But as they walk and understand one another, Livia falls for Franz. So, when he proposes a clandestine meeting, Livia feels shame for how much she wishes to fulfill that request. It seems Livia has brought the melodrama of the stage into her life. The film follows the roller coaster of Franz and Livia's affair to the only place it could ever go.

The word ""senso"" in Italian means ""sense, feeling, or lust."" This film takes the naked lust of the novella and converts it into a full-blown love affair. The film beautifully realizes the era with meticulous costume design and impressionist-inspired production design. Rather than write a score, the film uses period music from Anton Bruckner.

As a result, Visconti's fellow Italians accused him of betraying the principles of neo-realism—a funny accusation considering he was one of the movement's founders. It was also Visconti's first use of color and boy, did this movie warrant it. If the film excels at anything, it's the visual texture that it develops and maintains throughout. This sense of realism girds the heightened story in a sense of time and place.

The film strongly opposes war. Franz gives a speech about war's true purpose: to force people into thinking and behaving in ways that benefit the people in power. Why else would a person go onto a battlefield to die, except that someone has convinced them that it will make a difference?

The war scenes are elaborate but ultimately pretty boring. Similarly, I couldn't get myself on the same wavelength as the central romance. I could see the levels of manipulation and delusion at play, but something about how we experience it just didn't click with me until the climax. I'd like to try the movie again in a different setting at some point.

Still, the movie is beautifully crafted and has plenty to appreciate.","criterion channel, criterion, criterion challenge 2022, cc2022, written by women, 1001 movies, scorsese's 85 film",2025-04-09

<blockquote><i>The whole world is dying of panicky fright.</i></blockquote>

The film contains three intertwining narratives, each telling a distinct story. Gay author Jean Genet's novels inspire the three stories. 

Each segment has its own film style or set of styles. Hero has a tabloid TV style. Homo feels like a prison film when in the present and like an old Technicolor movie when in memory. Horror looks like a '60s horror film. It's not mere pastiche, however — the cinematography and storytelling itself exceed these frames.

What ties them all together is their gay themes: a boy bullied and beaten for being gay, unrequited love because both carry deep toxic masculinity, and the leperous treatment gay men receive as perceived ""disease carriers."" None of it is subtle; the way it plays with the very troupes that other gay men is hella camp.

Out of the gate, Haynes tells us that he is not married to any one style and that he is unafraid of taboo topics. The result is brilliant and hints at how Haynes eschews genre throughout his career.

Manuela is a nurse at Ramón y Cajal Hospital watching an EKG monitor. She steps away to call the National Transplant Organization and inform them of a potential donor. Back home, she prepares dinner for herself and her 17-year-old son, Esteban. Esteban calls her into the living room as <i>All About Eve</i> starts on TV. Through their conversation, we see how much Esteban cares for his mother and how much his mother cares for him. Esteban is an aspiring writer working on a story about Manuela for a competition.

One night, Manuela and Esteban see a performance of <i>A Streetcar Named Desire</i>, starring Huma Rojo as Blanche DuBois. Manuela connects with the character of Stella, whom she played 20 years ago. Esteban's father, who died before he was born, played Stanley. After the show, Esteban wants to get Huma Rojo's autograph. They stand in the rain, waiting for her to exit the theater. When she exits, she immediately jumps into a taxi. Esteban, undeterred, runs after the taxi. He doesn't see the car turn in, which hits him and kills him.

<blockquote><i>Last night, Mom showed me a picture of when she was young. Half of it was missing. I didn't want to tell her, but my life is missing that same half. </i></blockquote>

At the hospital, Manuela gives consent for the hospital to donate Esteban's heart, which goes to a man in A Coruña. Three weeks pass, and Manuela tracks down the man who received the donated heart. Her partner, Mamen, tries to help her process, but Manuela wants to be alone. So, she quits her job and travels to Barcelona to find Esteban's other mother, Lola.

The film follows Manuela as she reunites with her past and all its secrets and forges new relationships that strengthen her during this painful time.

Many of Almodóvar's movies feature motherhood in some capacity, exploring the various ways it manifests. This film's title, while a dedication to all mothers, is also about his mother, Francisca Caballero, who died a few months after this film's release. As a writer himself, Almodóvar wishes to encase in the amber of film the deep and complex love he has for her and the way artists use art to keep alive feelings for people who have passed.

As someone with a complicated relationship with my mother, I'm unsure if Almodóvar intends for the erotic subtext between mother and son. His devotion and fixation on her have the intensity of a lover more than that of a son.

<blockquote><i>Boys who live alone with their mothers have a special look, more serious than normal, like an intellectual or a writer. In my case, that's normal because I'm also a writer.</i></blockquote>

Almodóvar rarely shies away from rich colors—this film is no different. Its stunning reds, blues, and teals add warmth to the scenes. These colors appear at home, on stage, in costumes, and even in the color-coded binders at the National Transplant Organization.

The movie plays with metatextual elements. Esteban complains about the Spanish title of <i>All About Eve</i>, <i>Eve Unveiled</i>, saying it should be <i>Todo Sobre Eve</i>. Manuela says the title sounds weird just as this movie's title card comes up. In <i>All About Eve</i>, Margo complains about folks who seek autographs, saying they're not true fans—a foreshadowing of future events. Similarly, Manuela acts in a recreation of a woman losing her husband and the doctors asking her about organ donations.

These moments also act as homage to many of Almodóvar's influences. Manuella buys Esteban a copy of Truman Capote's <i>Music for Chameleons</i>. They see <i>A Streetcar Named Desire</i>—Tennesee Williams's melodramatic story overlaps with this one.

The film gracefully handles trans characters and sex workers. Some of the language has evolved since, but for 1999, it's a relief to be able to relax and know the film will treat these characters with care, even if they face awful circumstances. This is, after all, a melodrama.

I have always appreciated Almodóvar, but his stylistic choices work together beautifully here. This film is easily my favorite of his that I've seen thus far. I hope to live my life with the same generosity of heart that Manuela has in this movie.","criterion channel, criterion, criterion challenge 2022, cc2022, queer, solidarity, 1001 movies, sight and sound",2025-04-10

Warriors' Island is a burial ground for disgraced martial artists where rumor says that monks raise these warriors from their graves to keep out outsiders. A plane lands on the Island, where monks wait at the dock. A German man in a white suit with a uh, familiar mustache steps out of the plane. Three men corral five women hostages. The men rip off the women's clothes and put them on a scale with baskets of jade on the other side. The monks remove one woman for being too skinny. Otherwise, the men take the baskets of jade and load them into the plane. As the plane leaves, a kung fu zombie comes out of the woods and kills the skinny woman.

Cut to a taxi heading for Port of Long Beach. Taylor, Schwartz, and O'Malley of the Burbank Karate Club are going on a budget tour of the islands of the South China Sea, which passes Warriors' Island. Host Hazel Buck and temperamental Captain Harry Dodds welcome them aboard. The boys exhibit their martial arts skills alongside the boat's chef, who is a bit of a fighter. They catch the eyes of Cookie Winchell, an LAPD SWAT Team member, who also shows the boys a move or two.

Hazel Buck reveals to a crew member that several passengers want to visit Warriors' Island this time. The men all pair off with a woman, except for O'Malley, who ends up in a thruple situation with a married couple. When they dock, O'Malley and the husband, Lloyd, go to The Palace of 1001 Pleasures. Uh oh, Colonel Hitler Sanders and his woman-nappers also show up, ready to take more women to Warriors' Island to trade. Posing as police, the mercenaries raid the palace. When they learn that the boat is going to Warriors' Island, the mercenaries chase them down so they can protect their source of jade.

This movie is quite silly and intentionally so. It knows its concept is goofy and tries to pack in as much fun as it can. The film puts most sex comedies to shame with the amount of superfluous nudity it packs in. If you thought Andy Sidaris movies were indulgent, this movie says, ""Hold my beer.""

The fight choreo isn't much, especially for the white dudes, but they manage to set up some decent set pieces. The film blends martial arts with slasher kills, further emphasizing the ""throw everything at the audience"" mentality of the movie. They even throw in some piranha footage from Joe Dante's <i>Piranha</i> because why not?

The movie slows down a bit once they get on the island—a classic case of the plot getting in the way of the movie. The film spends so much time building up the zombie fighters that there's just no way the finale can match expectations. It's fun, don't get me wrong, but it's low-budget fun.

A monster on the bed. Well, on the TV that Keith is watching, he also happens to be in bed. Keith's phone rings. A crying voice on the other end—his girlfriend, Laura, sitting in her car downstairs. He rides with her, trying to tell her how he never cried as a child, but he stumbles and stutters over his words. Laura gets out of the car to grab something from the gas station. Keith holds his eyes open, trying to force himself to cry. When Laura gets in, he wipes away the tears as though distraught.

Keith brings Laura back to his apartment. She gets on the bed, turns to face the wall, and continues to cry. Keith spends a long time trying to think of what to do. Finally, he puts socks on his hands, gets under the bed, and puts on a sock puppet show. Laura looks on, confused, picking at her irritated face. Keith doesn't have a mirror, but he does have a metal spatula. Laura pokes at her irritated skin before reminding Keith that she's allergic to down — his pillows are down. But Laura just lays back down and rubs her face into the pillowcase-less down pillow. When he tries to stop her, she stabs him with a thumbtack she pulled from the wall.

The next day, Laura silently leaves, and Keith goes to work. He sits in the back of an unmarked white van with several socially awkward nerds. Keith tries to apologize to his boss, Carmine, but Carmine is profoundly uninterested in Keith's personal life and far too impatient to sit while Keith stumbles through his words. So, Carmine drops Keith off so he can do his job: selling coupons door-to-door, which ostensibly helps people affected by multiple sclerosis.

The film follows Keith's misadventures as he alienates everyone around him.

<blockquote><i>— Has it ever occurred to you that your ridiculous, disjointed splutterings might inspire me to want to malign you? That I might deliberately not pay the bill just to punish you for torturing me with your pathologies? I'm just throwing it out there.
— I appreciate that.</i></blockquote>

Keith's inability to communicate may trap him in social isolation, but everyone's self-absorbed antipathy towards him drives him further into his erratic confabulation.

Keith is not the only awkward character—everyone around him is terrible at communication, further putting Keith in a trapped sense of social isolation.

Sean Price Williams's manic cinematography makes every scene feel intense, but with nowhere for that energy to go, it feels stressful and awkward. It's like turning the heat on high after the rice has already absorbed the water. Both Sean Price Williams and director Ronald Bronstein regularly collaborate with the Safdie Brothers, if that gives you a hint at the movie's tense filmmaking.

The score consists of slimy synths with sci-fi twirls, which further add to the movie's off-kilter, uncomfortable tone.

Maybe I have a terrible sense of humor, but I found this quite funny in that painful way. Dore Mann's over-explanatory awkwardness is pitch-perfect.","criterion channel, criterion, criterion challenge 2022, cc2022",2025-04-12

Bradley Thomas pulls up to the auto shop in his tow truck, a car in tow. His boss is waiting for him outside to lay him off. He cleans out his locket and jumps in his baby blue Pontiac Formula. He gets home and finds his trash can overturned. His wife, Lauren, is sitting in her car. He opens her car door and pulls back her hair to see a hickey on her neck. Lauren admits to having an affair. He punches through her driver's window and disassembles her car by hand in a bloodied rage.

Afterward, Bradley sits down with Lauren to discuss their relationship. She seems nonplussed about his bloodied knuckles full of glass. He uses a metaphor for getting gas station coffee and always grabbing skim milk instead of cream to express how unfair life has been to him. So, he wants to start over with a clean slate and try to have another kid. And to make things work, he's going to traffick drugs for his friend Gil.

Eighteen months pass. Bradley makes a drug drop-off, gets a fat wad, and returns to his swanky house. Bradley gets a call from Gil and meets him at his place. Bradley and Gil meet with Eleazar, who tasks Bradley with a crystal meth pickup in exchange for three months of paternity leave. Bradley doesn't trust them but goes along with it. We're already a half-hour in, so yadda yadda yadda, the drug deal is a police trap, and Bradley goes to prison for seven years.

The meaning of the film's title and the inciting incident don't happen until halfway through the movie, which is also around the time I started wishing for the movie to be over.

The film plays like a conservative persecution complex. Vince Vaughn is a ""redneck"" who ""owns two American flags"" and ""won't watch movies with subtitles."" <i>Bone Tomahawk</i> was weirdly racist, but at least it had ""period drama"" to account for it (sort of). Here, there's no obvious excuse.

But that's not why people talk about this movie. They want that ultra-violence. Like Cronenberg, Zahler tries to make the violence as visceral as possible. Unlike Cronenberg, who does it to make the violence unglamorous and unappealing, Zahler relishes the grotesque and knows its audience does too.

Of course, it looks like I'm in the minority here. And I don't think anyone ""should"" feel the same way about it. I'm sure you can find inconsistencies in my reviews about when this stuff rubs me the wrong way. But here, it did.

2025-04-15,Day for Night,1973,https://boxd.it/9pqhyj,3.5,,"François Truffaut plays Ferrand, a director working on a melodrama called <i>Meet Pamela</i> about a woman falling in love with her husband's father. The film follows <i>Meet Pamela</i>'s production and the melodrama behind the scenes.

Going into the movie, I expected its meta nature to be less conventional, having only seen Trauffaut's earlier films. However, as I reflect on it, I understand why he held back on experimental filmmaking choices. The title refers to the filmmaking process where nighttime shots are filmed during the day with a filter to make it look like night, which hints at the film's desire to look at the artificiality of filmmaking.

Throughout the film, we see characters whose lives are in tumultuous states—trouble with alcohol, cheating lovers, nervous breakdowns, and so on. But the crew is dedicated to making <i>Meet Pamela</i>, so whenever anyone threatens to leave, another crew member will come to rally them back to the cause. Trauffaut's Ferrand states outright that people like them are only happy when working and that their personal lives suffer as a result.

Seeing this at the Rialto with the film club was nice because they appreciated the film's sense of humor and made me feel more comfortable laughing. The movie has several one-liners that I enjoyed. I also liked how the film would go out of its way to stop and look at anything that showed a director's name—Truffaut is making homage to the comfort movies of his upbringing and wants everyone to know that he knows who he is stealing from.

Oh, and there's a scene where they try to get a kitten to act, and everyone (myself included) was losing it over how adorable it was.

Knowing what the film is now, I may revisit it and score it higher. But as it stands, the film's slight nature left me wanting something more.","rialto, owen, emma, written by women, criterion, 1001 movies",2025-04-13

<b>Day 89</b>
After only three months, the streets of Little Falls, New York, are cracked, and nature has begun reclaiming them. Teenage Regan and her four-year-old brother Cade tiptoe through the dilapidated drug store. Their other brother, Marcus, sits quietly along the empty shelves. Evelyn, their mother, looks through the filled prescription bottles, careful not to move them or make a noise. She gives Marcus a pill and signs to Regan that he's okay.

Cade tries to grab a toy off the shelf and nearly drops it, but Regan catches it in time. Their father, Lee, packs some supplies for the radio and carefully pulls the batteries out of Cade's toy before setting it aside. But Regan sneaks it back to Cade, and Cade takes the batteries. Outside, the family walks along sand paths they laid out to prevent crunching leaves. Suddenly, Cade's toy goes off, and Lee runs towards Cade. But it's too late—a creature comes out of the woods and takes the child.

<b>Day 472</b>
Regan awakens in a field on the farm where the family lives. Newspapers surround Lee to tell us that silence is the secret. His whiteboard has the most basic notes, including ""What is their weakness??"" in a box. Whatever these creatures are, they have taken over the world. Lee sends out SOSs over the shortwave radio using Morse Code. The film labors to show us the corn field and grain silo, so these will be set pieces later in the film, I assume. Evelyn is pregnant—I'm dying thinking about her and Lee's silent lovemaking. How are they going to keep a baby from crying? Evelyn has a baby oxygen mask, a tank, and a soundproof box to keep the baby in.

Anyway, the rest of the movie oscillates between quiet family life and sudden outbursts of sound that jeopardize it.

The best part of the movie is Millicent Simmonds's performance. As a deaf actor, she knows how to act with sign language. The other actors do all right except for John Krasinski, who thinks sign language IS acting.

The smartest move the filmmakers made was putting the film on Netflix, where millions watched <i>The Office</i> and nothing else. If anything would get them to watch a movie, it's having John Kransinski star in it.

The filmmakers' dumbest move was continuing to develop the rules around the monsters as the movie progressed. Seeing that they painted themselves into a corner, they found an exception that allowed them to skirt it.

The film is a great horror movie idea. It's equal parts fun and frustrating to imagine what a director who actually liked the genre could do with it. I tried to suspend disbelief for this story, but when there is so much quiet for reflection, it becomes increasingly harder to accept. Still, I never had a bad time.","oh my horror, omh, omh2025",2025-04-14

A woman interviews sixteen-year-old Lokita, who is looking for a work visa. The woman asks Lokita about the story she gave immigration when she entered Belgium. She asks about Lokita's school in Benin, her principal, and meeting her eleven-year-old brother, Tori, who has his papers. Lokita's answers only beg more questions and introduce contradictions. Overwhelmed, Lokita stops to take her medication and asks for a postponement of the interview.

Tori wakes Lokita up at the center where they live, grilling her on her Bariba and attempting to fill in gaps surrounding the orphanage. That night, Lokita and Tori perform karaoke at a restaurant. Afterward, they go downstairs to meet with Betim, who gives them satchels of weed and coke and an address to add to their route. They also get some money to kick off the karaoke—the two courier the drugs, dealing with shortchangers and negotiators. Back at the restaurant, they get their 50 euros. Batim offers Lokita an additional 50 for oral sex. She initially declines, but Batim insists.

The next day, Lokita takes the 100 euros to Western Union to wire to her mother in Garoua, Cameroon. Justine, a woman from church, grabs her and takes her to see Firmin. Firmin and Justine helped Tori get to Belgium and expect payment. Lokita hands it over, and Justine searches Lokita's bag and underneath her clothes for more. Justine finds an additional 50 in Lokita's shoes.

The film follows Lokita and Tori as they navigate their complicated life in Belgium.

<blockquote><i>— Why won't they give me my papers, Tori? Why?
— They don't want us.</i></blockquote>

What makes this film work is Joely Mbundu's and Pablo Schils's performances as Lokita and Tori, respectively. Though Lokita wishes to be the adult and the provider, her panic attacks and impulsive decisions get her into more trouble than needed. Tori has more of a survival instinct, able to lie and ask for what she needs. In this way, the film reflects how this world punishes emotional honesty and sincerity.

It's difficult to determine the line between representation of real issues and exploitation for an emotional impact on an audience. Similarly, the film has difficulty maintaining a sense of realism as it chases melodramatic story elements. The film's back half is tense and frustrating in equal parts as characters make impulsive choices.

The only other movie I've seen from the Dardenne's is <i>Rosetta</i>, which feels similar to this in that it looks at troubled youth surviving in Belgium. Following the social realist model, the Dardennes focus on the working class and youth. Their films tend not to moralize, only observe. They follow that model to a degree but take the movie in uncharacteristic directions.

Still, aspects of this story feel vital, especially in a world where the treatment of immigrants and overseas workers only grows worse as Late Capitalist exploitation corrodes. This film elicits empathy for its characters, who are otherwise invisible.","criterion channel, criterion challenge 2022, cc2022, solidarity",2025-04-15

It's early morning in Cumbernauld. Several boys play football before school. Gregory's team loses—their eighth loss in a row. The coach, Phil Menzies, proposes switching up the team, trying out new people, and letting some folks go. Gregory, for example.

<blockquote><i>— We need goals. It's your job to get them, and you don't!
— Well, nobody's perfect. It's a tricky time for me.</i></blockquote>

Gregory's father, Mike, whom Gregory calls Mike, teaches driver's education. Gregory accidentally walks in front of the car. Mike stops Gregory to schedule breakfast in the kitchen on Friday since neither he nor his Mum sees much of Gregory.

Menzies tries out some new strikers to replace Gregory. Among the tryouts is Dorothy. Menzies is reticent to try out Dorothy, but she insists. Dorothy demonstrates far superior skills to the other tryouts. Gregory happens to pass and falls hard for Dorothy.

<blockquote><i>— Have you ever been in love? I'm in love.
— Since when?
— About half an hour ago. It's great. I feel restless, and I'm dizzy. It's wonderful. Bet I don't get any sleep tonight.
— That sounds more like indigestion.</i></blockquote>

The film follows Gregory as he ineptly pursues Dorothy, even if it may cost him a position on the football team. But maybe Dorothy isn't the girl for him, yeah?

This movie is so funny! Gregory is so ridiculous yet perfectly believable as an awkward, know-it-all teenager. His friends are all childlike in their way. Andy, for example, still likes to watch the big trucks on the freeway. Andy and Charlie feel totally inept regarding women, especially once Gregory starts pursuing them. I love how the film also shows the interaction between the male teachers, showcasing just how little they've grown up compared to the boys they teach.

<blockquote><i>— Look at all these men.
— Boys?
— What's the difference?</i></blockquote>

As a product of the 80s, the film grossly objectifies several of the women we encounter. We first meet Gregory and his friends spying on a woman changing. In Home Economics, Steve mansplains pie crust to Susan before patting her on the bum, leaving a hand-shaped flour print on her. That said, the film goes out of its way to show how hopelessly dumb the boys are. It also conveys how the women in Gregory's life have helped him get where he is, especially his 10-year-old sister, Madeleine. It's not perfect by any means, but 

This film may be my favorite teen comedy from the 1980s—at least that I've seen thus far.

Two nymphs dance in a regal park. One dips the other, and they kiss. Cut to a bookshop, where the nymphs are now the older Eduoard Lestingois and younger Chloe Anne Marie. Eduoard calls himself Priapus, after the Greek god with a huge, permanent erection. He laments his boring wife, Emma, who doesn't have sex with him anymore. Chloe runs upstairs to prepare soup. Emma returns home from the funeral of her only friend, and Edouard voices his annoyance at her returning early.

In a park, a tramp sits with his back to a tree and a dog in his lap. He pulls some scraps from his jacket and shooes the dog away. The dog wanders into the river. When the tramp stops eating, he looks around for his dog and cannot find it. He asks a cop for help, but the cop threatens to arrest him. A woman runs up looking for her dog, and several officers approach to assist her. A man drives up in a convertible and offers to drive her around to help her search.

Eduoard uses his telescope to spy on women around the Pont des Arts. He spots the despondent tramp and relishes how squalid the tramp looks. His satisfaction turns to shock as he watches the tramp jump the railing into the River Seine. Eduard rushes outside and drives into the water. Dozens of people look on as Edouard swims across and rescues the tramp. A passing ferry throws out a life preserver and pulls the men in. Through laborious resuscitation using Silvester's method, they get the tramp to come to and learn his name: Boudu.

The film follows the Lestingois as they try to make Boudu's life worth living by refining him. Believe it or not, it doesn't go well.

— How wonderful! A member of our class showing true civic courage.

The film came out in a transitional time for film when talkies were taking off. With the space usually occupied by title cards, the film feels open. When the dog runs off, we watch it walk around for at least 30 seconds and do nothing in particular. Chloe sings a song while cleaning and dusting stuffed birds. Still, the comedic intent of several scenes comes through, even if it doesn't always hit its mark.

The film functions as a social satire. Like Viridiana, it overturns the notion of a ""kindly tramp"" a la Charlie Chaplin and gives us a flawed human being. Boudu doesn't know how to communicate and doesn't want to. The Lestingois wish to remake Boudu in their own image and make him respectable. Boudu does everything possible to destroy that notion—not with intentional malice, but with the stubbornness of a dog who won't learn to behave.

In this way, the film gives us no reason to root for Boudu because Boudu is an allegory for all that society wishes to ignore. We see Boudu do some truly heinous things—it would be bizarre to cheer Boudu on. That's not to say we should take away a moral message from this movie. If I were to inject one, it would be, ""Don't take in a stray dog and expect him to perform tricks.""

Still, the movie shows its age in its sexual politics in a way that makes it hard for me to love it.","criterion channel, criterion, criterion challenge 2022, cc2022, edited by women, solidarity, 1001 movies",2025-04-17

<blockquote><i>Wherever the bird with no feet flew, she found trees with no limbs.</i> — Audre Lorde</blockquote>

Seventeen-year-old Alike, or Lee as she goes by, stands in a strip club with her friend Laura, watching a beautiful woman slide down the pole. Laura throws bills at the woman while Lee stands there, mouth agape. Cut to another club, where Lee sits on a couch alone. She checks the time and grabs Laura, dancing with a woman. Outside, Laura presses on Lee why she's still a virgin and hasn't found herself a girl yet. It looks like a friend razzing a friend, but Lee feels the disconnect between the reality of this night and her life at home.

On the bus, Laura tries to ride with Lee to her place, but Lee forces her to get off at her stop. With Laura gone, Lee strips off her cap and polo, putting them in her camo bag. Underneath, she wears a woman's tee. She puts her earrings in before stepping into her house. Her mother, Audrey, asks Lee where she's been, her curfew being 12:30. She also complements the tee Audrey is wearing, saying it ""compliments her figure."" When Lee dismisses the compliment, Audrey reminds Lee that she doesn't like Laura. 

The next day, when Lee gets to school, she changes out of the femme clothes she left the house in, donning a tank top, cap, and baggy tee. During lunch, she takes the cafeteria food to Mrs. Alvarado's classroom. Lee shows the English teacher her poems. Mrs. Alvarado is meh on the poems—beautiful, but she knows Lee can go deeper.

After church one day, Audrey introduces Lee to the daughter of a church friend—a girl named Bina. The film follows Lee as she spends more time with Bina and develops feelings for her.

<blockquote><i>— I don't know what you think this is going to change.
— I know God doesn't make mistakes.</i></blockquote>

The filmmaking is economical, not wasting a moment on anything that doesn't tell us more about Lee and her family. That doesn't mean it doesn't have artistic flourishes, though. The first time we meet Alike, in the strip club, we see the stripper sliding head first down the pole. When the camera cuts to Alike, it is spinning around to look at her right-side up, a natural smile on her face. Her face is lit in a soft teal, and the world around her is a rich magenta.

The camera has rapid attention, moving from person to person, like the eyes of someone trying to assess who and what is safe in their environment. Some people get less than a second—all the time needed to catch a vibe or dismiss it outright. This tension increases at home when Lee must suppress herself furthest.

Audrey's staunch Christian mindset makes her tense around other people. In the same way that Lee doesn't feel she can express herself authentically, Audrey sees herself the same way. Meanwhile, while strict in one sense, Lee's father, Arthur, is more laid back with Lee. The two can go out and play basketball, and Arther will treat her like one of the guys, razzing and all. But he's still a father and still has the same gender expectations of his daughter as Audrey does. Audrey and Arthur's relationship is rocky and complicated.

I loved watching Alike and Bina's relationship develop organically. It captures that teenage relationship universal of shared music taste, awkwardness, and terrible communication.

Grave Encounters was a reality TV show hosted by ghost hunter Lance Preston. The executives canceled the show after five episodes. The executive producer, Jerry Hartfield, explains why and shows us recovered footage of the sixth and final episode. The episode focuses on the Collingwood Psychiatric Hospital, an abandoned place noted for its unexplained phenomena. The crew locks itself inside the hospital at night. What's going to happen?

🙄 Okay, Jerry.

The film does a great job of parodying these shitty ghost-hunter shows. Sean Rogerson nails the smarmy type of guy that would host this. Where the movie suffers is when it tries to have legitimate scares. Its reliance on CGI is a shame, but it's how strictly this adheres to the found footage horror beats.

The cast is tremendous, the worldbuilding is rich, and the music is genuinely moving at points. But the script is a colossal mess that undermines many of its themes with a baffling post-credit sequence. For example, the dance and music choreography is incredible, but the fight sequences are sloppy and lazy. We spend so much time learning layouts, meeting characters, and setting up threads that never get picked up or even mentioned again.

What works best in the movie is its exploration of how whiteness and cultural theft go hand in hand. The soul of this movie is black music, and it's black music that draws out the vampires.

My working theory is that this started as a pilot for a <i>Lovecraft Country</i>-esque show that got an ending smushed onto it—something akin to <i>Mulholland Dr.</i> Adam's theory is that this is a passion project that the director was too close to. Regardless, I'm hoping Ryan Coogler pulls a Ridley Scott and delivers a five-hour director's cut that justifies the pile of loose ends.

A scientist sits in his lab reading a hefty tome. He closes it and addresses the audience. He speaks of humanity's fear of the unknown and how much that startles them. It's not new, but startling when it shakes their conventional understanding. The scientist pours liquids into vials, producing color changes and smoke. When satisfied, he sits down, seeing the bustling streets of people going somewhere. Then he hears a crying baby—the start of a new life.

We then see Patricia's body. Inspector Warren enters, along with a doctor. They find Patricia's suicide note, which details her time in jail for cross-dressing. When not in women's clothing, Patricia is Patrick. But she cannot bear to live as Patrick, so she takes her life dressed as Patricia. Warren visits with Dr. Alton to better understand cross-dressing and transgender people and hopefully prevent future suicides in the community. And so, Dr. Alton relays the story of Glen, who secretly dresses as Glenda.

George Weiss wanted to make an exploitation film based on Christine Jorgensen's sex reassignment surgery, which became a major news headline. Ed Wood volunteered to tell the story, suggesting his cross-dressing made him the perfect director for the project. 

 Instead of telling Jorgensen's story, Ed Wood made a movie about cross-dressing and transgender identities to appeal to understanding. Still, Wood fulfills the demand for a film about sex change by tacking on a second story, Alan or Anne, about an intersex person who undergoes surgery to become a woman.

Calling this film a successful argument is an overstatement. Though well-intentioned, Ed Wood's inability to tell a story without layers of meta-text only obfuscates the message. Of course, the acting and dialogue also leave much to be desired. Most glaringly, the language used in the film is severely outdated and NOT helpful for contemporary audiences seeking to understand the subject matter.

Bela Lugosi's presence here is sweeter than in his other performances. He has no real narrative purpose here, functioning primarily as a name to attract the audience.

The best part of the movie is the dream sequence. Yes, it has all the footage that the producers injected of whipping and sadomasochism. Still, it also has Glenda reckoning with her identity by meeting several trans people and fellow cross-dressers.

Still, Ed Wood's moviemaking is so singular that, for all its failures and misgivings, it remains compelling, making it a perfect 'good-bad' movie.","amazon prime, cmc, cmc2017, queer, solidarity, extreme",2025-04-22

Duckett grabs a knife and stabs Cole in the chest, then stabs himself in the head, killing himself.

Cut to Mia, dressed in black and having a difficult day. Riley, Jade's younger brother, calls her for a ride. While driving back, they find a dying kangaroo on the road. Mia attempts to drive over it to put it out of its misery, but she can't bring herself to kill it, even though it's suffering. When they get to Riley's, Mia drops in to say hey to Jade, whom she hasn't talked to in some time. Mia shows Jade a video from Haley's Snapchat in which a girl's eyes are all black. They're having another event that night, and Mia wants to go. Jade isn't interested until Mia reminds Jade that it's been two years since Mia's mom, Rhea, died. So, Jade, Riley, and Mia sneak out to the event.

After some awkward sitting around, Joss brings out a backpack. Mia volunteers for whatever is about to happen. Joss ties Mia to the chair. Haley goes over the rules: no more than 90 seconds, or they will want to stay. To initiate conversation with the dead, she must say, ""Talk to me."" To be possessed by it, she must say, ""I let you in."" Haley lights a candle while Joss brings out a severed embalmed hand. Mia grabs the hand and says, ""Talk to me."" A man appears across from her. She pulls away immediately, and the man disappears. Jade thinks Mia is just fucking with her. So, Mia will prove it.

The next time doesn't go exactly right, but Mia is hooked.

The film is another meditation on grief, focusing on the self-destructive ways we try to escape it. The hand and channeling spirits are functionally similar to drugs in that they give the characters an escape from themselves and an ecstatic experience to boot. For those who know, you must allow grief to move through you to leave the body. Whatever we don't let pass stays. Of course, the film isn't content to explore its metaphor as presented, and things get… messy.

Jade has the Crazy Frog ringtone. She instantly became the coolest person in the movie.

I love Miranda Otto as Jade and Riley's mother. She instantly catches on to everything.

Sophie Wilde is outstanding as Mia. She handles some complicated character beats gracefully. Similarly, Joe Bird, as Riley, is a surprisingly nuanced character.

<b>Florence, 1907</b>
The film opens with Dame Kiri Te Kanawa's performance of ""O mio babbino caro"" from <i>Gianni Schicchi</i> by Puccini. Lucy Honeychurch opens the blinds of the Pensione Bertolini, where she is staying on holiday. Behind her stands her cousin and chaperone, Charlotte Bartlett. Both are disappointed by their view, which they expected to be the Arno. In other words, the senora who runs the country house gave them a north-facing room without a view instead of a south-facing room with one.

The two get dressed for dinner, where they meet other English guests. While Eleanor Lavish, a novelist, rants about places one must see in Italy, George Emerson makes a question mark out of his meal, turning his plate to Lucy. When George's father hears Lucy and Charlotte complaining about the lack of a view, Mr. Emerson speaks up about his and George's rooms, which have views, suggesting that they switch. Charlotte refuses, sparking a fervent argument from Mr. Emerson about women's love of views and men's aversion to them. The Reverend Mr. Beebe intercedes, and the switch is made.

The following morning, Lucy wakes up to a tremendous view. She dresses and plays Beethoven, drawing Mr. Beebe's attention. She steps outside to sightsee, visiting the Basilica di Santa Croce without a Baedeker to assist. Mr. Emerson speaks over a tour guide, drawing his ire. Then, upon spotting George, Mr. Emerson laments George's brooding and asks Lucy to help George find joy in life. While leaving the basilica and wandering the city, Lucy sees two men fighting. One stabs the other in the stomach repeatedly, killing him. Witnessing the man's bloodied mouth, Lucy faints. George catches her before she falls to the ground, carrying her to a place of rest. When she comes to, she tries to walk off alone, but George sees she is in no fit state.

And so, the two have a brief moment of walking together, unchaperoned, during which their interest in one another blossoms. The film follows their relationship in Florence before following Lucy back to Surrey and her sudden engagement.

Like all Merchant Ivory movies, the film is resplendent with period detail—costumes, hair, sets, and art direction are all meticulous, drawing the audience gracefully into its Edwardian world. This film helped them break through. Structurally, it closely follows the novel, including the Dramatis Personae and the gorgeous title cards for the chapters.

The movie features several actors younger than I've seen them before, including Helena Bonham Carter in her breakout role. Seeing Maggie Smith, Judi Dench, and Daniel Day-Lewis looking so young is a treat! And, of course, Denholm Elliott always looks the same.

The film's dry period humor won't be to everyone's tastes, but it's delightful if you can get on the film's wavelength. Daniel Day-Lewis is quite funny as the stuffy, repressed Cecil Vyse.

It's the 1970s, and disco is king. Folks dance at the Blueberry Hill disco. The DJ announces the main event: Tucker Williams, AKA the Disco Godfather, dancing in his baby blue spandex as he crosses the dancefloor and enters the DJ booth. He shouts his catchphrase, ""Put your weight on it!"" as he takes over DJing. Among the patrons is Bucky, the Godfather's nephew, who jumps on the dance floor with his girlfriend, Linda.

Bucky steps outside with Linda, who laments that Bucky hasn't been the same lately since he started smoking angel dust. Bucky's a basketball star on his way to the pros, and Linda worries that his drug habit will get in the way. Later, Linda comes screaming to the Godfather that Bucky smoked too much angel dust. Bucky wanders in, thinking he's playing basketball. Bucky breaks down, seeing the folks around him as having red eyes and attacking him. He sees the Godfather turn into a skeleton and a woman into a demonic witch, swiping a machete at him.

An ambulance arrives, taking Bucky to a PCP ward in Marygrove, run by Dr. Mathis. There, Dr. Mathis gives the Godfather a rundown of PCP and how it's affecting the youth of the 1970s. They tour the PCP ward, where kids are freaking out in Reefer Madness-esque ways. One woman cradles a doll—apparently, she had cooked her four-month-old baby and served it as a holiday dinner to her family.

<blockquote><i>Haven't you heard, Godfather? Our children are dying.</i></blockquote>

<b>This movie is where ""I'm just a poor country lawyer…"" comes from!</b>

Duke Ellington's score and Saul Bass's title credits set a swinging mood before we meet Paul Biegler, driving a 1950 Pontiac Chieftain De Luxe with the top down, as the sun sets, as he enters the city limits of Iron City, Michigan. Paul's friend and local drunk, Parnell McCarthy, sees Paul pull up to his house, where he also practices law as an attorney. Hanging on the mounted deer horns is a note from Paul's secretary, Maida, to reach out to Laura Manion in Thunder Bay. Parnell comes in, and the two share a drink. Parnell is worried about Paul's habits since Paul lost his re-election bid for district attorney after 10 years in the position. Parnell was an attorney in his time and recognized the familiar patterns.

The phone rings with Laura Manion. Parnell tells Paul to say yes if she asks Paul to represent her husband. Paul isn't quite so gung-ho and wishes to meet the man and get more information before making any commitments. After Paul schedules an appointment for the following day, Parnell gives Paul the rundown. The story goes that Barney Quill raped Mrs. Manion, and Mr. Manion, a lieutenant in the US Army, comes to Quill's inn and shoots Barney five times with a Luger P08, killing him. The following day, Maida opens the shop and finds Parnell passed out on the couch. She hints to Paul that money is tight and that he should get paid for the Manion case.

Paul meets Laura, who looks like a femme fatale, with her sharp sunglasses and a Yorkshire terrier named Mutt. Inside, she removes her sunglasses to reveal a black eye, just one of the many marks Barney Quill left behind. Mr. Manion, or Manny as Laura calls him, is worried about Paul's lack of experience as a defense attorney. Manny believes he should get off because Quill raped his wife. Paul informs him that such ""unwritten laws"" are a myth. If Manny had caught Barney in the act, he might have had a defense—not only that, but he didn't call the police and took justice into his own hands. Paul won't give Manny a justification or defense for why he killed Barney—Manny has to figure that out for himself.

<blockquote><i>Maybe you're too pure, Paul—too pure for the natural impurities of the law.</i></blockquote>

The film follows the case as Paul learns the details and helps build a defense.

Otto Preminger often shot monochrome well into the 60s. Here, it shifts a contemporary audience's expectations about what happens in a black-and-white movie. So, when Laura talks about Barney calling her an ""army slut,"" we're pulled into the grim present.

This film marked several firsts for Hollywood. The film is based on a book that is based on a real murder that occurred in Big Bay, Michigan, in 1952 at the Lumberjack Tavern, in which the filmmakers shot several scenes—this would be the first time a Hollywood movie used an actual murder location for the movie. Also, the trial proceedings do not mince words when it comes to the alleged rape and beating, leading to bans of the film that Preminger had to file motions against to get the movie shown.

The film's brilliance is its play with audience expectations. The Jimmy Stewart we get is not the idealist of Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, but the jaded lawyer who is willing to defend a self-proclaimed murderer.

The film lets Jimmy Stewart be the sassiest and most sarcastic I've seen him. He's got a quip for everything, especially when the subject isn't all that funny. This carries over into the courtroom, where he pulls all sorts of tricks. He also has a stupid recurring bit that I love: He searches his pockets for matches or a lighter he doesn't have before asking for one or taking one from the scene.

<blockquote><i>As a lawyer, I've had to learn that people aren't just good or just bad, but people are many things… Everybody loves something or someone.</i></blockquote>

The movie explores the audience's relationship with Laura through Paul. To him, she dresses scantily, which he loves, and she believes all men want something from her, including Paul. Paul interrogates how she dressed on the night Barney raped her, suggesting but not outright saying that she may have ""asked for it."" But in the court of law, the word ""panties"" causes such an uproar that the judge assembles the prosecution and defense to think of an alternative word. When no alternative is found, the judge's word usage sends the courtroom into laughter.

It's wild seeing young Ben Gazzara! The earliest movie I can remember seeing him in was <i>The Killing of a Chinese Bookie</i>, which came out nearly twenty years after this one.

I love the rough edges of Paul and Manny's relationship. Neither likes the other, but both need each other for one reason or another. Manny is probably 20 years younger than Paul, and this film came out after Rebel Without a Cause, so some of the hostility feels generational—the older generation, especially the small-town types, expect a certain respect. In contrast, the younger generation just wants a straight answer for once.

The officer at the bar is one of the best drunk portrayals I've seen on screen. He's military, so he has total body control, and like all drunks, he's trying to pretend like he isn't. His form is rigid, but his words have the occasional slur and bluntness that betray his attempts.

The procedural structure of the movie might bore some audiences, especially those raised on <i>Law & Order</i>, given its two-hour and forty-minute runtime. Still, I think the pacing of the film is damn near perfect, giving us all the texture we need to get a grip on our characters without really understanding them. This includes a bizarre final scene that has gross implications.","criterion challenge 2022, cc2022, 1001 movies",2025-04-25

Lord Bluebeard, with that beard and mustache, freaks folks out. But that's not the reason they despise him. They all suspect Bluebeard is killing his wives.

Two messengers come before the queen with a pronouncement from Bluebeard: that his six wives are dead, and he asks to evaluate and marry one of the queen's two daughters. The announcement horrifies the queen and her two daughters. More horrifying still is the arrival of Bluebeard, who adorns the women with jewelry, dresses, and other gifts. Their backs turned, Bluebeard makes his choice of a new bride.

When a war calls, Bluebeard leaves keys with his new bride, allowing her to open any door she wishes. Bluebeard asks that she not open the forbidden room—otherwise, all doors are on the table.

So, of course, she's gonna open that door.

1930s claymation is so wild! I kind of love it! The film makes regular use of the clay as clay, allowing characters to roll up as balls of clay before unspooling to a character. It seems that Bluebeard can decapitate without consequence because they're all clay? Or maybe I misread that. 

The zoom-ins are jarring, but I imagine it was difficult to rig the camera to move forward without using rails in the scene.

Oh, did I mention this is a musical? Yeah, it's got songs.

The moral of this is supposed to be, ""Curiosity killed the cat?"" Like, the bride shouldn't have opened the door??

Greg, Fiona, Ruthie, and Paul hike up a mountain. Greg recognizes a snowstorm coming in at an overlook, but Paul shushes him. Paul hears an intermittent, faint whistle, but no one else hears it. He walks towards the sound, falling into a crevice. Fiona and Ruthie help Greg set up rappelling ropes. He rappels down and discovers Paul, uninjured, sitting in front of a strange skeleton embedded in the cave walls—it looks human-like but much bigger. Greg reaches for Paul to help him up, but Paul finally speaks, only to say, ""If you touch me, you'll die."" Greg drags him out and carries him down the mountain over his shoulders.

The storm intensifies, and they search for shelter for the night. Fiona spots a house over a ridge, and the four pile in, finding it abandoned. Ruthie holds Paul while Greg strips him. Ruthie sees a bejeweled bone in Paul's jacket. The following morning, Greg and Fiona go out to look for a path down to no avail. During the night, Paul whispers into Ruthie's ear. On the third morning, they discover Paul missing and footprints leading from the house. They find Paul sitting in front of the bridge they crossed, blowing into a bejeweled bone like a flute. Paul whispers something, and Ruthie draws the knife, stabbing Greg, slitting Fiona's throat, and throwing them and herself off the cliff. Greg tearfully looks on, playing the bone flute.

<b>Webster Mills, Missouri, 2018</b>
Former detective James Lasombra goes on his morning run. Since his wife, Allison, and son, Henry, died in a car accident a year ago, James is still grieving and unsure what to do with himself. Coming home, he finds his neighbor Nora's daughter, Amanda, sitting outside. She, too, is grieving the loss of a father, but says she has found something that has brought her freedom: the belief that nothing is real—the belief that whatever we manifest internally becomes our reality—that our thoughts are not our own, but messages transmitted to us. 

The following day, Nora finds Amanda missing. On the mirror is a message, in blood, reading, ""The Empty Man made me do it."" James leaps at the chance to solve a mystery and be useful. Of course, unimaginable horrors ensue.

<blockquote><i>Where were you?</i></blockquote>

The film has a methodical pace—it doesn't have a tremendous amount on its mind, but it aims for organic worldbuilding. So, it takes nearly 30 minutes for the movie's plot to kick in, but we've already been introduced to so much flavor that we let it unfold. I saw someone compare the directing to David Fincher's, if that helps give you an idea.

It's hard to make this movie sound good on paper—it comes across as something like <i>The Bye Bye Man</i>. But this movie is quite different. It doesn't have teenage scares on its mind, or at least ONLY teenage scares. It has creeping dread and ambiguity, something like <i>Cure</i> or <i>The Ring</i>. It also has the ""elevated horror"" fixation on grief, but I appreciated how this film used it.

At first, the concept of the empty man sounded like Tibetan Buddhism's view on thought: what we meditate on is what we manifest. And I guess it continues down that path, but in a more mythical manner and with other occult, eldritch, or continental philosophical accouterments. It sort of acts on the fear-mongering that Christians have done in the past regarding meditation: that if you still the voice in your head, a demon's voice may enter.

Kudos to the filmmakers for filming a young, nude woman and finding a way to make it communicate vulnerability without leering.

As much as I appreciate what the film is doing, it gets stuck in a couple of tired tropes, which took me out of it a bit. But it doesn't go on too long.

I can see why someone would give this a high or low score, especially given their feelings about the ending. As for me, it was comfortable and familiar territory, but I had a great time getting lost in it.","oh my horror, omh, omh2025",2025-04-27

Séverine Serizy and her husband, Dr. Pierre Serizy, ride arm-in-arm in the back of a horse-driven carriage. The two love one another, but Pierre thinks Séverine is frigid. When the carriage reaches a place with sufficient covering, Pierre demands the carriage stop and Séverine get out. When she resists, the carriage drivers assist in pulling her out, taking her to the woods, where they bound her mouth, tie her up, and rip open her dress. The cabbies whip her with the horse whips before Pierre allows them to have their way with her.

Séverine comes to when Pierre asks what's on her mind. She relays that she was thinking about the two of them on a carriage ride— a now-familiar daydream to Pierre, even if he doesn't know the specifics. Pierre attempts to climb into bed with Séverine, but she asks him not to, sending him to his bed. The following day, the two take a skip trip with friends Henri and Renée for their one-year wedding anniversary. Séverine likes Renée but despises the way Henri looks at her. While riding in a cab, Renée tells Séverine about their friend Henriette, who now does sex work at a brothel. The idea won't leave Séverine's head.

Back at the house, Herni has left flowers for Séverine. She accidentally drops the vase, breaking it. In the bathroom, she accidentally knocks over a bottle of perfume. She recalls a childhood memory of a man sitting her on his lap and running his fingers up her body. At the tennis courts, she is still distant and distracted. She sees Henriette leave, and Henri waxes poetic about his wonderful memories at a specific brothel, giving her the address. He makes more advances on Séverine, who rejects them. But the address stays with her. She is reluctant to enter the place but does so anyway. On the way up, she recalls taking the communion but refusing to let the priest put the wafer in her mouth.

The film follows Séverine as she works at the brothel, setting a strict schedule to avoid her husband's knowledge and taking on the name Belle de Jour. Perhaps there, she can exercise her silent fantasies or exorcise her repressed memories.

The film is based on a novel of the same name. Buñuel did not choose the project but came to it under a contract with the Hakim brothers. He didn't like the book, so he did what he could to make the story his own. Also, he didn't like the choice of Catherine Deneuve, who was only twenty-two at the time.

Deneuve finished the project feeling used and unhappy as Buñuel demanded more of her than she wished. Still, the role became one of her most iconic. The film solidified an archetype the actress first explored in <i>Replusion</i> as a blank slate for men to project their fantasies and perversions. Henri projects innocence and virtue onto her, which seeds his desire for her. Pierre sees an unbearable distance between them, even as Séverine's love for him grows. Marcel, one of the clients, sees her as something to possess and control, something stable in his otherwise unstable life.

The audience may see her as yet another bored housewife occupying so many of these stories. We may think we understand why Séverine works at the brothel—we can use the images of her childhood, the fantasies we're allowed to see, and we can draw up something about trauma, sex vs. love, etc. But not even Séverine knows why she is there. All she knows is that she is drawn to it and cannot escape it.

The film does make explicit its themes surrounding fantasy and reality. The brothel becomes a place where fantasy can leave the mind and still not impose on the perceived perfection of Séverine's reality. But we also see it in the lives of others. In one scene, the daughter of the brothel's housemaid comes in to see her mother, and a brothel client believes she works there. The housemaid, Pallas, swiftly directs her daughter upstairs to their apartment. All women, no matter their age, become sexual objects within the confines of the brothel.

Of all the Buñuel movies I've seen, this one has the most coherent plot and structure. The surrealism mostly occurs during the fantasy sequences, where Séverine dreams of new ways of being demeaned and dominated. These sequences aren't straightforward, especially as the film progresses, and are open to several interpretations. Also, everyone just throws stuff on the floor—glasses, cigarettes, and so on—and it doesn't seem to bother anyone.

What helps this movie stand out most is its final twenty minutes, which brilliantly bring everything together and, depending on how you read it, could upturn your interpretation of the movie as a whole.","criterion channel, criterion, criterion challenge 2022, cc2022, edited by women, 1001 movies, golden lion",2025-04-28

This movie was a lotus blossom blooming in my skull, not just because it was a ""mindfuck"" but because it contained so much empathy and so much darkness and asked so much of me as an audience member that I felt like I had to ask more of the movies I watched.

2025-04-30,Mulholland Dr.,1999,https://boxd.it/9ywxxz,,,"<blockquote><i>You look like someone else...</i></blockquote>The significant differences between the pilot and the final movie, aside from the second half, are that scenes in the pilot tend to be longer and include more contextual information. The film used alternate takes in places that allowed scenes to end more quickly. The one noteworthy exception is the audition scene, which cuts out the introductions.


<b>Other differences I noticed (no spoilers for the pilot or movie, I promise):</b>
* The headshot of Camilla Rhodes is different: same actress, but the facial similarities to Betty aren't as immediately apparent.
* Scott Coffey has an actual role as a friend who gives Justin Theroux a place to stay in the long term. 
* We get a little more Robert Forster and Brent Briscoe trying to solve the mystery of the missing person from the car crash, and they follow a lead to Palmdale.


One thing I noticed last night while watching the movie is that Rita's wig changes dramatically between when we first see it and when we see it later. I assumed it was because one was from pilot footage and one was from the movie, and the pilot suggests that, too.

In the end, it shows just how much editing work went into the final movie to tighten up the storytelling and heighten the ambiguity. Still, the film retains some TV-ness from the pilot, which is why it doesn't feel like it's two and a half hours long. This pilot won't answer any questions—it just gives a clearer idea of where the show would have gone.",archive.org,2025-04-29

<b>Old Hong Kong, 19th century</b>

At Victoria Police Court, the HK Marine Police has had a difficult time combating raiding pirates. The Police Force resents the amount of funding the Marine Police receive for how little they've accomplished—meanwhile, the Police Force's pay raises and other funding remain on hold. The Marine Police see their work as a suicide mission, drinking away their miseries at the bar. But one of them believes they may have a shot, a Sergeant named Dragon Ma. The pirates have already destroyed two of their five ships. As they head to the remaining ships, another two blow up.

Chiang and Chou Wing Ling, two gangsters, look to flee to Vietnam. Once Chou leaves, Chiang meets with two pirates, whom Chiang helped to sabotage the Marine Police ships. The pirates tell Chiang of their boss, San Pao, and his need for 100 police rifles. Chiang believes he can count on Captain Chi's assistance. Admiral Shih appeals to the British Admiral with a new plan to take out the pirates, called Project A. However, the admiral is uninterested, and Captain Chi forces the Marine Police to become street cops. Chi has a particular assignment for them—to undergo extensive training under Inspector Hong, the captain's nephew, so that they can become part of a special police force.

Their first operation is to arrest Chou. But things aren't as they appear, and Dragon Ma quits the police force. Is there corruption in the police force? If so, will Dragon Ma be able to do anything about it? Things look up when double agent Fei comes to assist. Or do they??

The movie's title is intentionally vague so that it wouldn't give away aspects of the film and inspire copycats, as had happened with Snake in the Eagle's Shadow and Drunken Master.

The plot is convoluted if you can't tell from my roundabout summary. I had to cut several details just to make it coherent. But that's not why you watch a Jackie Chan movie—you watch it for the stunts. Like most Golden Harvest comedies, the humor is silly, but the deft stuntwork helps offset the silliness. The cinematography is excellent during the fight scenes, capturing the marvel of the stuntwork while keeping the editing tight.

It's also fun to see Chan acting with fellow Seven Little Fortunes Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao. This film was the first of six movies that the three did together in the 80s as the ""Three Dragons."" Hung and Chan get the most screen time together, including a synchronized fight in which they both perform the same moves in tandem.

This film was Chan's first nomination for Best Actor and won Best Action Choreography at the HK Film Awards. At the same time, Jackie Chan's stunt team received a Best Action Choreography nomination for the Sammo Hung-directed Three Dragon flick, <i>Wheels on Meals</i>. Chan had attempted to break through in Hollywood with <i>The Cannonball Run</i> and <i>Battle Creek Brawl</i>, but neither did much for his career. Thank God, because his HK work was his peak.

Jackie Chan made the film before he became aware of Buster Keaton. Chan only learned about Keaton when Western critics kept comparing the two. Once Chan saw Keaton, he readily acknowledged and agreed with the comparisons. The stunt where Chan hangs from a clock hand is also reminiscent of Harold Lloyd in <i>Safety Last</i>, with one notable exception: it's painful to watch, especially knowing Chan injured his neck in the process.

This film may not be Chan's best, but it set the template for his blend of martial arts, action, and comedy, which would rocket him to stardom.","torrent, cmc, cmc2017, chopsocky",2025-04-29

<blockquote><i>Lend yourself to others, but give yourself to yourself.</i> — Montaigne</blockquote>

The film is split into 12 tableaux. The first tableau is titled ""A Café — Nana Wants to Give Up — Paul — The Pinball Machine."" Nana sits with her husband Paul at a café, where they discuss an affair Nana had. She tries her words several times to deliver them as perfect lines, annoying Paul, who finds Nana self-involved. But Nana finds Paul difficult to be with, feeling invisible and like she must demand him to see and love her. Nana wishes to be an actress, on stage but perhaps in the movies someday, but Paul finds the desire small-minded, even though he is a musician. Paul sees everyone as the same, but Anna wants to be special. Nana will leave Paul with their infant son to pursue her dream.

<blockquote><i>A bird is an animal with an inside and an outside. Take away the outside, and the inside is left. Take away the inside, and you see its soul.</i></blockquote>

Now, Nana works in a record shop but is behind on rent and struggling to make ends meet. She tries to borrow two thousand francs from Paul, her coworkers, or anyone else, but they all refuse. When she returns home, her landlady has kicked her out of the apartment. She tries to break in, but they hold her back. The next day, Paul asks her to dinner, but she goes to see The Passion of Joan of Arc with a man. The film brings Nana to tears.

<blockquote><i>— How can you still believe God sent you?
— God knows our path, but we understand it only at the end of the road.</i></blockquote>

After the movie, she leaves her date, annoyed that he paid for a movie ticket and didn't get anything out of it, to meet with another man who promised to take photos of her. She lies to the photographer about the date being her brother. He shows her a layout of images, which he claims is a package one puts together to send out to people in films. It will require her to undress, which she reluctantly agrees to.

The film follows Nana as she gives more and more of herself in the search to live her own life.

Nana resembles Louise Brooks in Pandora's Box, with her bobbed haircut and the direction her life takes. The film suggests in each scene that death is coming. At the record shop, we see the French title for ""The Lion Sleeps Tonight,"" ""le lion est mort ce soir,"" or ""The Lion Died Tonight."" When we watch The Passion of Joan of Arc, it is the scene where the priests come to prepare her for death and martyrdom.

The death may be spiritual, as the image of the bird losing its inside and outside only leaves a soul, and Nana has both taken from her in one way or another. Regardless, Goddard wants to destroy Nana, the same way that he wanted to ""destroy"" cinema. Godard is seeking a new reality in film—a ""more real"" reality. He used improvisation as the driving force of scenes and refused retakes, allowing whatever occurred to be the definitive version.

The cinematography is notably minimal, using methods of distancing to make the film more ""film-like."" The camera shoots dialogue with the characters' backs to the screen. The editing is almost haphazard, cutting before the scenes feel over. The intertitles tell us what will happen in each scene, cutting into scenes, giving it the feeling of collage or assemblage.

<blockquote><i>Modernity, in whatever age it appears, cannot exist without a shattering of belief and without discovery of the ""lack of reality"" of reality, together with the invention of other realities.</i> — Jean-François Lyotard, <i>The Postmodern Condition</i></blockquote>

In this way, the film also rejects a progressive storytelling flow. A scene happens, an intertitle tells us something else will happen, and it does. It all moves in one direction, but we don't get why or how. We arrive at moments, or more importantly, we see Nana make choices that, by design, we cannot understand. We can empathize with Nana, but if we want to humanize Nana, that is left as an exercise for the audience.

We can understand this: Nana does not know where she belongs in the world. And the world does not give her a perch to rest—only a way to obliteration.

Leslie struggles to carry the groceries, handle the dog, Marbo, and open the front door. She calls her daughter, Jennifer, to help, to no avail. She struggles to the back door, seeing Jennifer on the phone with her father and Leslie's husband, Howard. Jennifer puts Howard on speakerphone and lets Leslie in, who gives Howard a rundown of the night's vegetarian (again) dinner. Howard hears ""seaweed quiche"" and says he can't make dinner. He hangs up before Leslie can argue. Jennifer runs off, too, meeting Stacey at the horror and science fiction convention.

Another night alone with Marbo, Leslie plops on the couch to find something to watch. Leslie sees a news report about a dog attack, but the dog in the report looks like the mayor. The woman claims the mayor is a werewolf. Howard returns home, hiding a bag of food, and falls asleep on the couch to Leslie's plea for more excitement in their life.

The next day, Howard has the boys over to watch a ball game on TV, relegating Leslie to being a housemaid and beer fetcher. Frustrated, Leslie leaves to grab a flea collar at the pet store. The mysterious owner, Harry Thropen, gives her a handful of flea collars on the house. When she steps outside, a thief snatches her purse. Harry sees it happen, corners the thief, and returns Leslie's purse to her. As thanks, she buys him lunch. She finds herself drawn to him and his unusual eyes. Harry licks and kisses her, bringing her back to the pet store to have sex. He sucks on her toe, biting it and drawing blood. That breaks the spell, and Leslie storms out.

The family notices slight changes in Leslie. For one, she cooks steaks for dinner. She's also more voracious in the bedroom. And it looks like she may be sprouting fangs. I hate to say it, but it looks like Jennifer's mom is becoming a werewolf!

The movie operates in an unusual space. It is not innocent enough for a family movie—the phrase ""toe job"" comes up, among other sexual innuendos—but it is not violent or scary enough for most horror fans. That said, it's pretty silly, even funny at times. The movie has a scene similar to <i>The Santa Clause</i>'s beard-shaving scene but with leg hair.

Of course, my favorite character is Stacey, a kindred horror fanatic. I, too, feel like I have to drag folks to my horror events and movies. Susan Blakely is quite entertaining as Leslie. She has solid comedic timing and delivers some groan-worthy lines with enough pizzazz to make them work.

Folks will compare this movie to Michael Fischa's more successful and ridiculous horror movie, <i>Death Spa</i>. I appreciate that Fischa tried to diversify his directorial efforts. And I kind of like this movie! It doesn't do anything groundbreaking, but I had a fun time!

Florence Carala confesses her love for Julien Tavernier over the phone, and Julien his love for her. Julien sits in his office at Carala Corp. They arrange to meet at their usual spot, the Royal Cameo, once Julien finishes the job. They hang up, and Julien calls for Geneviève to watch things while he takes care of something in his office. Julien returns to his office, donning gloves, a revolver, and a rope attached to a hook. Opening the window, he steps out onto the balcony that lines the outside of the building. He throws the hook up, catching on the railing one floor up. Down a few windows, Julien opens one into a reception area outside Mr. Carala's office. Mr. Carala calls him in. Julien puts a gun to his head. Mr. Carala recognizes the gun as his own.

A cutaway, then Julien slips the gun into Mr. Carala's hand to make it look like a suicide. He locks the inside doors, using his knife to hold open the latch as he exits the last one. Julien's phone rings, and he rushes down the rope to get to his phone to answer. Maurice, the security guard, and Geneviève leave the office with Julien. Outside, Julien gets into his convertible. Véronique, the florist across the way, says hello to him. Véronique's boyfriend, Louis, checks himself out in the shop window. Julien starts the car, looks up, and sees his rope hanging from the balcony rail—in his rush to get to the phone, he left it behind.

Julien rushes over to the elevator to go up. While it ascends, Maurice shuts off the power to leave for the weekend, trapping Julien between floors. Maurice also closes the gates to the building behind him. Louis notices the convertible is still running. He jumps in and starts to drive off. Upset, Véronique runs after him and jumps in. Trying to turn off the windshield wipers, Louis pops the cover instead. So, when the car drives by the Royal Cameo, Florence sees Véronique and assumes Julien is in the driver's seat. Florence can only assume that Julien didn't go through with the plan.

The film follows these threads as Julien tries to escape, Florence wanders the streets searching for him, and Louis and Véronique wreak havoc.

As others have said, the film is most magical when Jeanne Moreau wanders the streets at night, the Miles Davis score pulling us into her somber disconcertion. This film is the first in which she didn't wear the full makeup regalia that other directors asked of her. That, along with the natural lighting of the night shots, gives the film an anti-romance to its unadorned naturalism.

The film's crime story leads folks to consider it noir, but in some ways, it functions contrary to many noir tropes. Most notably, Florence isn't quite the femme fatale—no double cross in mind, and nothing won in the murder. Similarly, perhaps more convincingly, the film is lumped in with the French New Wave. Louis and Véronique are a sort of proto Michel and Patricia from <i>Breathless</i>—Louis, a car thief with a record, drags Véronique, aware but coerced, into his life, but doesn't share her resolve.

That said, Miles Davis's score gives this film its place in history. Through his improvisations for the soundtrack, Davis developed his modal jazz style, which he would fully employ the following year on <i>Kind of Blue</i>.

Still, the script is whip-smart, building tension in tiny measures, crafting a thread that doesn't give way until the final minutes.","criterion channel, criterion, criterion challenge 2022, cc2022, film noir",2025-05-02

<blockquote><i>When was the last time I laughed?</i></blockquote>

Grover walks through a happening club to his boss, Sugarman. Grover brought Sugarman a strung-out chick who would do anything to get a fix, and she was waiting in Sugarman's car. Grover drives them back to his place while Sugarman gets in with the girl. Back at Grover's place, Grover preps some heroin. Sugarman turns off the lights, and the girl pulls a sawed-off shotgun out of her bag. She shoots Sugarman in the face and takes a prepped needle off him. She corners Grover in the bathroom and introduces herself: her name is Coffy, and her sister is LuBelle, an 11-year-old Grover got hooked on smack. So, Coffy adds on top of what Grover's already injected in himself, causing him to OD.

Coffy returns to her job as a nurse at the emergency room, shaken up but determined. But her shakiness is too much, and the doctor sends her out. Officer McHenry and his new partner, Officer Carter Brown, show up at the hospital to follow up on the OD that came in that night. Carter sees Coffy, with whom he had a fling when they were both kids. He still wants to date her, but Coffy's dating Howard Brunswick, a city councilman. Carter tells Coffy about the bizarre case they're on: a junkie shot his hookup and then OD'd. But Carter thinks it's other drug dealers trying to encroach on the area.

Coffy brings Carter with her the next day to a juvenile rehabilitation center to see LuBelle. He drops her off at home, where a car waits to take her to a nightclub, where Howard meets with Captain Reuben Ramos, the deputy commissioner. Howard announces his plan to run for Congress, so he and Coffy return to his place to celebrate. Later, Coffy gets off her shift at the hospital. Carter finds her distraught and brings her to his place for coffee. An officer calls Carter to get him in with a drug kingpin named Vitroni, but Carter refuses and threatens to turn him in. The cop sends a couple of cronies to beat up Carter and incapacitate Coffy.

With Carter, the one good cop she knows, in the hospital and irrevocably crippled, Coffy finds her resolve renewed to find the bastards responsible and take them down.

<blockquote><i>I'm gonna piss on your grave tomorrow.</i></blockquote>

Like all vigilante movies I've seen, the film questions the efficacy of the police in handling these drug cases. Coffy and Carter want justice, but what that looks like for each differs. Coffy would kill a drug dealer to get them off the street, but Carter sees the chain, and a dealer is just one link in it. Coffy suspects the cops are getting some action from these drug deals. Carter doesn't deny that—an officer tries to get Carter in on it, but Carter threatens to turn the cop in for it.

Like heroin on the body, Coffy's revenge murders haunt her mind. She believes she did the right thing, but the images won't leave her head. But what also haunts her are images of LuBelle.

Roy Ayers's score is perfect. His blend of jazz and funk is the perfect tone for a film focusing on a morally ambiguous vigilante. It isn't pervasive, as the film takes a more subdued and realistic approach (at least, initially—once the plot kicks in, stuff gets more outrageous).

The film came out a couple of years after Nixon kicked off his never-ending war on drugs—a total failure of a political measure that nevertheless continues to infringe on personal liberties while increasing funding for law enforcement and prisons. Notably, the film takes the less popular anti-drug stance, which may have contributed to its poor performance. But it does so by looking at the white power structure that reinforces class and race divide by punishing the people of color caught in the middle.

Jack Hill scrapped the planned sequel because of the film's middling reception and made <i>Foxy Brown</i> instead. This film may not have been the break for Pam Grier that Hill anticipated, but with it and <i>Foxy Brown</i>, Grier became a household name—the first woman action star and the face of blaxploitation for the rest of the 1970s.","tubi, cmc, cmc2017, blaxploitation, vigilante",2025-05-03

A woman, whom we only know as Mother, works in a medicinal herbs shop, chopping up some supplies. Across the road is her 27-year-old son, Yoon Do-joon, who has an intellectual disability and lives with her. Do-joon playfully gets a dog to wave at her and Do-joon's friend, Jin-Tae. He pulls the dog out onto the road to make it dance. A Mercedes-Benz knocks Do-joon over, sending Mother running after him. Do-joon runs off with Jin-tae to catch a taxi and find Benz. They see the Benz in a country club parking lot. Jin-tae kicks the mirror off, and the two enter the golf course. Do-joon gets distracted and picks up golf balls out of the lake, thinking he can give them to a girl as a gift. Jin-tae makes fun of Do-joon, saying Do-joon has never slept with a woman. Do-joon assures Jin-tae that he has: he has slept with his mother.

Finally, the Benz drivers pass, and the two attack them, throwing their clubs into the lake. At the police station, the cop says the attack and the hit-and-run cancel each other out. Regarding the car damage, Jin-tae blames Do-joon, and Do-joon assumes he must be correct. While all this happens, Do-joon writes his name in Sharpie on several golf balls. The Benz driver files a suit against Do-joon and calls Do-joon the R-word, sending Do-joon into a frenzy. Another cop calms him down as his mother comes in to pick him up. The suit puts a strain on his mother. When Do-joon suggests Jin-tae can lend them the money, his mother is annoyed, telling Do-joon to stay away from him. Do-joon leaves to meet up with Jin-tae, fixated on the idea of sleeping with a woman.

At the bar, a drunk Do-joon waits for Jin-tae to arrive, poorly flirting with a woman who is also waiting for Jin-tae. Meanwhile, Jin-tae returns to the golf course to pull a golf club out of the lake. The bar closes, kicking Do-joon out, but not before he hits on the owner's daughter, Mi-na. While walking home, he sees a high school girl named Moon Ah-jung walking alone. Do-joon drunkenly calls out to her about sleeping with him. Ah-jung ducks into an abandoned building to evade Do-joon. Do-joon gets the hint and goes home, where he climbs into bed with his mother. The next morning, the police discover Ah-jung dead on the rooftop of the abandoned building. The police don't find much at the crime scene except for a golf ball on which Do-joon wrote his name.

After the police pick up Do-joon (and immediately get into a car accident, drawing the small town's attention to the fact that Do-joon is in the back of a police car), the mother looks for a way to prove Do-joon's innocence.

The film is spiritually similar to <i>Memories of Murder</i>. The inciting incident is similar to a lead that Detective Park follows in that movie that ultimately leads nowhere. Also, like that movie, this one aims for a blend of comedy and darkness. I don't think this one is as successful at that, but it has moments. Its biggest mistake is leaning too hard into making Do-joon the butt of so many jokes.

Kim Hye-ja has moments when she's excellent and moments when she seems to be going for comedy. I can't blame her—the material seems confused about when it wants to hit certain tones. Still, she's the heart that holds this movie together—whenever I felt the movie slipping from me, she brought me back.

The score has slight Hitchcock nods, including a motif that sounds like the central theme from <i>Vertigo</i>. It's subtle enough that I appreciate the nod.

The cinematography always seeks clever angles or aesthetic compositions, even when they don't serve the moment. It was annoying at first, but I got over it.

The mystery is pretty compelling, although it takes over half the movie to get to it and regularly cuts itself off, slackening any tension it builds. Still, it finds its way, and the third act is one of Bong Joon Ho's best.

<blockquote><i>Are you lonesome tonight? Do you miss me tonight? Are you sorry we drifted apart? Does your memory stray to a brighter summer day when I kissed you and called you sweetheart?</i> — Elvis Presley, ""Are You Lonesome Tonight?""</blockquote>

<b>Summer of the 48th year of the Republic of China (ROC) (1959)</b>
Xiao Si'r's father speaks to the principal regarding his son's failing test score, believing it to be a mistake. The school promises to revisit the score but assures him that Jianguo High's night school program isn't bad. His father, however, knows the school's reputation and worries that any prolonged time there will turn Si'r ""bad."" The radio lists students qualified to attend National Chengchi University at breakfast the following morning.

<b>Ninth month of the 49th year of the ROC (September 1960)</b>
Si'r's become a real troublemaker. He and his best friend, Cat, sneak off to the film set next door, watching from the rafters. When they spot an actress changing clothes, Cat drops his book, and the two run for it, but not before stealing a flashlight. After night school, Si'r tags along with the Little Park Boys, a local gang that Cat is in, but not him. Members of the 217s cornered Sly, the Little Park Boys' interim leader, at the grade school. Si'r wanders around the school and sees a girl run out of one of the classrooms, although Sly claims to be alone.

Things grow tense for Si'r as Sly hears Si'r spread rumors about the girl he saw. At home, he grows ever distant from his family as gang affairs take over. Meanwhile, his family deals with social pressures to assimilate and settle down, not unlike the gang mentality that has affected the children—tempting because doing so may provide the family the connections they need to get Si'r back in day school. As they ride home on the bus, tanks pass them by. After Ming experiences an injury at school and Si'r receives a vaccination, the nurse tasks Si'r with walking Ming to class, and the two become friends.

The film follows Si'r as gang violence increases and his family experiences difficulties that shake their foundations.

<blockquote><i>You're so honorable. It'll get you into trouble.</i></blockquote>

The film's Mandarin title and English title reveal the two facets of the movie. The Mandarin title, which translates to ""Youth Homicide Incident On Guiling Street,"" describes a moment in the film. The event comes from Yang's childhood—the movie builds around it but is not ""about"" it. The English title gives way to the more transcendental themes of the film. This title comes from the Elvis Presley rendition of ""Are You Lonesome Tonight?"" which Si'r's sister helps translate for Cat, a huge Elvis Presley fan. The title reflects the loneliness and longing of childhood, when one can't wait for the freedom of adulthood, but also of Taiwan post-civil war, when their connection to China was severed and remains so.

<blockquote><i>Do you know how lonely life can be? You know what it feels like in the depths of despair?</i></blockquote>

Music plays a key role in the movie. We hear characters singing and listening to music. Cat performs with a band at the diner. We hear some songs repeated but in entirely different contexts, drawing out nuances in the song while also reflecting the universality of music. It doesn't matter which gang you're a part of, how old you are, or where you are—a song can touch you.

Like Yang's other movies, the shots are often beautiful, static compositions that let the story unfold in long takes or simple cuts. The film uses juxtaposition in powerful ways, building space and allowing us into the characters' heads. Specific settings have repeated compositions to reinforce their familiarity with the routine. This approach is perfect for the astute attention to period costumes, settings, and landmarks.

The film studio is a recurring setting, reflecting Taiwan's then-budding film industry and Yang's love of movies from a young age. It also suggests how movies play into the kids' notions of being an adult—westerns and gangster flicks. Not that movies are the only ones to blame—the father's anger becomes the son's anger.

The film offers a rich portrait of Taiwan in the 1960s. Si'r's family came to Taiwan from Shanghai at the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949. His family and those like it lived tenuous lives, unsure of their future. Without a strong sense of cultural identity or security, the children formed street gangs so they would feel like they belonged to something. They could join the military, but they see that as an inevitable death—something also likely in their gang relationships, which they either ignore or repress.

S'ir's father came from the country. It wasn't until he moved to Shanghai and met Wang that he learned the ways of the world. Si'r has a similar naivete and can stand up for what he believes is right. But the world punishes both of them for refusing to assimilate in the ways that others around them do. At school, a kid cheats off of Si'r's paper. Si'r refuses to help him, and the school punishes both. When Si'r tries to speak up for himself, the school punishes him further. When Si'r's father comes to Si'r's defense, the school gives every excuse why Si'r deserves the treatment he receives.

<blockquote><i>— A person who will apologize for wrongs he didn't commit is capable of all sorts of terrible things.
— But that kind of thing seems to happen so often.
— Exactly. The purpose of education is to search for the truth of life to believe in. If you can't be brave enough to believe in it, then what's the purpose of life? […] You must believe your future is determined by your own hard work.</i></blockquote>

Their relationship feels so rich, in part, because Chang Kuo-Chu, who plays the father, is Chang Chen's real-life father. Chang Kuo-Chu introduced Chen to Edward Yang, and Chen got the part.

The film explores Taiwan's relationship with the USA through Wang, a colleague of Si'r's father, who regularly travels to the USA and espouses their politics. He jokes that if he could develop an atomic bomb, he'd use it to take out the Chinese Communists. I don't want to give away how that relationship plays out, but that direction and Wang's relationship with the USA are connected. Though one could make artificial comparisons between Taiwan and the USA regarding its colonist history, their current geopolitical status, and worldwide diaspora tell a more complicated story. That said, director Edward Yang explored the influence of the USA on Taiwan in many of his movies. <i>Taipei Story</i> is the most overt (that I've seen) in its exploration of cultural osmosis and identity loss in the face of modernity and globalization.

The film has a deliberate pace, letting the story and characters unfold organically. This choice makes summarizing the film challenging, as a four-hour movie cannot be about just one thing. But it never feels like the movie is spinning its wheels or experimenting to the detriment of the audience's experience. It allows us plenty of room to contemplate the meaning of each scene—especially helpful when characters and relationships remain unexplained. 

I loved the relationships, the writing, everything. Yang drew on his childhood for so many details—the film almost overflows with them in each scene, never asserting them. So many moments had me in tears, positive and negative. Yes, it will require patience to finish, but the experience is one of the most rewarding I've had while watching a movie.

A Hi-Lite Delivery van stops at 21 Shady Lane Avenue and drags a distressed wooden crate to the front door. The delivery men ring the doorbell, waking the disheveled Henry Jordan. Inside the crate, underneath a small forest of balled-up newspapers, is a television with a mirror strapped to it. While Henry writes at his typewriter, the TV turns on itself, showing a movie called <i>Zombie Blood Nightmare</i>. Henry turns the TV off, but it comes back on, so he unplugs it. Later that night, while Henry sleeps, the unplugged TV comes alive, and five zombies crawl out. The following morning, the delivery drivers return to Henry's, realizing they had mixed up a delivery meant to go to the Institute for the Studies of the Occult. When Henry doesn't answer, they push the partially opened door open the rest of the way to find Henry dead, bound, and wearing a party hat.

<b>Three months later</b>
Henry's house went up for sale after his death, and the Blair family soon purchased it. Zoe Blair, the daughter, arrives in a taxi with the moving truck, and Zoe lets them in and starts unloading kitchenware. Meanwhile, muddy Chuck Taylors and mossy jeans amble from the woods to the house and shake open the front door. But don't worry; it's only Zoe's brother, Jeff. The two will live at the house alone for the next week while their parents finish up living abroad in Saudi Arabia—a familiar arrangement for Zoe and Jeff. The next day, a truck with a Texas license plate arrives. Joshua Daniels is looking for a TV set that he mailed to the Institute for the Studies of the Occult. Joshua worries that it will claim more lives. Jeff isn't amused, leaving Joshua on the doorstep. 

Later, Jeff hears a woman's voice beckoning him to the attic. When he gets upstairs, he sees the unplugged TV. He carries it down to his room. Outside, Jeff rakes when his neighbor, April, walks by with Abe and Beverly Turchow's beloved black poodle, Chocolate. He invites her in for a tall glass of refreshing water. April takes the dog off the leash. It immediately runs into the woods and encounters one of the zombies. April and Jeff run out looking for Chocolate and find him dead. They pick up Chocolate's remains and walk home. A zombie follows.

Will these teens fare better than poor Mr. Jordan? What will Jeff see when he plugs in the television?

<blockquote><i>They look just like you and I. But inside, they're different. They have no soul.</i></blockquote>

The film revels in the grotesque: moldering goldfish in a filthy fish bowl, chewing tobacco spit on the pavement, a sink full of old, food-stained dishes, bleeding and festering zombie wounds, and the biggest plate of beanie-weenies you've ever seen. The effects are ambitious and look quite good for a direct-to-video 80s horror.

While it obviously riffs on <i>Videodrome</i> and <i>Demons 2</i>, the movie has its own take on the concept. You could argue that the film is making an argument about how television turns people into zombies. The role mirrors play suggest that self-reflection on what you've become is your only hope. I don't know how much the filmmakers thought about that, but these ideas are in the text, intentional or otherwise.

The film isn't hysterical but has effective (and intentional) funny moments. The rules around the zombies don't feel thoroughly thought through, but it's not that distracting. I wouldn't call it a forgotten classic, but it is underrated. The biggest gripe I can imagine horror fans having is that the kills aren't all that interesting—the zombies tend just to strangle people to death—but the film has enough going on that it didn't bother me. My biggest complaint is the slow second act—you could cut 20 minutes easily.

I'm not the biggest zombie movie fan, but this movie is fun enough that I quite enjoyed it!

<b>May 1997</b>
Jin-seok awakens in the back of a car with his mother, father, and older brother, Jin-seok, drenched in sweat. The family is moving into a new home. Though Jin-seok has never seen the house, he cannot help but feel it is familiar. Yu-seok, whom Jin-seok admires, walks with a limp from a car accident the previous year. Though their father initially promised them separate rooms, the previous owner begged their father to let them put some stuff in that room so the brothers could share a room. Per the prior owner's request, their father tells them never to enter the closed-off room at dinner that night. 

While in bed that night, Jin-seok hears repeated slamming and dragging sounds coming from the room. Jin-seok thinks about opening the door, but Yu-seok stops him. Yu-seok doesn't hear any sounds, so he takes Jin-seok outside for some air. Yu-seok gets a call from their dad and tells Jin-seok to hang out until his return. A group of men surrounds Yu-seok, knocking him out and dragging him into a car. Jin-seok runs after it, memorizing the license plate, but cannot catch up. That night, Jin-seok has the same nightmare, which we only see in jumbled images of surgical equipment and an axe over someone's head.

Detectives come the following day to get Jin-seok's story. He gives them the license plate number he memorized, but the detectives assure him it doesn't exist. Days pass with no word. He has the same nightmare each night and still hears noises from the room. After nineteen days, Yu-seok returns, but he has no memory of what has happened to him over those nineteen days. All seems good, but Jin-seok feels like something is off with Yu-seok. For one, his limp has switched sides (who does he think he is, Dr. House?). He also lies about going out at night.

So, one night, Jin-seok follows Yu-seok. What happened to Yu-seok? What's in the room? What is real, and what is in Jin-seok's head?

The film uses classic tropes to signal that all is not what it seems. Jin-seok takes methylphenobarbital for anxiety and has for a long time, despite it having severe long-term consequences. He's studying psychology, and we see him circle words like ""hypnosis."" And, of course, his recurring nightmare, which is either a premonition or a buried memory. Oh, and if you expect sensitivity around mental health, good luck.

You can poke a million holes in this, but the filmmaking and pacing are solid, and the performances are big enough for the material. I might have been more into this if these sort of mindfuck psychological thrillers weren't churned out by the dozens in the early 2000s. It's clumsy and doesn't earn its emotional moments, but it's entertaining.

It's Friday morning. A caravan of motorcycles, horseback riders, and trucks approaches the Rochefort-Martrou Transporter Bridge, crossing to Rochefort for the Fête de la Mer. The carnival members stretch out for a synchronized smoke as they all load onto the gondola. Once across, they set up in the town square. Étienne and Bill, who work for the carnival, hope to sell their boats, motorcycles, and what-have-yous at the fair.

Meanwhile, Delphine teaches ballet to children while her fraternal twin sister, Solange, plays the piano. As the children leave, Delphine and Solange tell us about their upbringing in Rochefort, their romantic hearts that long for art and love, and their desire to move to Paris, where Delphine will dance and Solange will compose.

Delphine and Solange's mother, Yvonne, runs a café in the town square, where Étienne and Bill go for some fries. She, who feels she should be living on the Pacific shore, instead lives in her glass aquarium: the café. Maxence, a sailor and café regular, is also a painter searching for his ideal love. He has painted her and put the painting in an art gallery. He awaits her arrival someday. 

Delphine arrives at the art gallery to meet with her boyfriend and gallery owner, Guillaume. He confesses his love of her body, assuming she will marry him, even though she has said no. She sees Maxence's painting and is sure it is of her. Guillaume assumes Delphine posed for it but will not tell her the artist's name, saying the artist is dull and insignificant. Still, she wants to meet the artist, but Guillaume lies and tells her that the artist has left for Paris. 

So Delphine breaks up with Guillaume, tells Solange about the artist, and decides to move to Paris. But first, Solange must meet with Simon Dame to arrange a meeting with American composer Andy Miller, who is giving a series of recitals in Paris. Though the sisters long for elsewhere, perhaps what they've longed for has been under their noses all along.

The film explores longing. Everyone we meet does one job but longs to be an artist. Poets sell boats, and composers accompany dancers. On a meta-level, they're also all singers and dancers. Tied to this longing is the desire to find their one true love—the person who sees them as they are and loves all of them.

Like <i>The Umbrellas of Cherbourg</i>, the color schemes are gorgeous. This movie goes to the next level, creating rich color schemes that repeat in every nook and cranny. The result is a dreamlike world where true love feels possible. Jacques Demy would take this even further in <i>Donkey Skin</i>, which lives in a surrealist fairy tale.

This film was a massive touchstone for <i>La La Land</i>—the music, the colors, and the introduction through public transit. Both films focus on artists who long to break out and the love they find along the way. <i>La La Land</i> also borrows (steals) several musical motifs from this movie. Where <i>La La Land</i> differs is the direction in which it takes the love story, which Jacques Demy explored in <i>The Umbrellas of Cherbourg</i>.

Despite playing (in part) as an homage to the Hollywood musical, the film was unsuccessful in the USA. Some speculate that the film's centering on the fine arts appeals more to the French sensibility, whereas Americans tend to see such things as ""elitist."" The film also barely has a plot. In what little it does, it happens in centimeters before another song breaks out. I prefer it because the songs end up shorter, giving us more variety.

I didn't know Catherine Deneuve had a sister! Alas, it's probably because she died in a car accident soon after this movie came out.

Why doesn't every musical watch this movie before filming to see how to do it? The cinematography is perfect for musicals.

A sort of Korean-speaking child surveys the playground to find a Princess Peach doll she's lost. Her mother, also sort of speaking Korean, tells her they'll keep looking tomorrow. The girl spots the doll. But then, off in the distance, she sees the faint outline of a large moving creature against the night sky. The wind picks up as the creature approaches.

<b>25 Years Later</b>
In New York City, Gloria arrives at the apartment she shares with her boyfriend, Tim. She gives Tim an excuse about where she was all last night and why she's strolling in so late. Tim tries not to be angry and tries not to start a fight, but he knows she's hungover again, and he's growing tired of it. He's packed her things to kick her out—he's going out and expects her to be gone when he gets back. Once Tim leaves, a group of Gloria's friends move up to the apartment to continue the party, but Gloria is heartbroken.

Cut to Mainhead, New Hampshire, where Gloria gets out of a taxi, grabs a key from under the mat, and goes into her childhood home, which her parents usually rent out. With no bed, she goes out to buy an air mattress. Walking the street, her childhood friend Oscar spots her and asks if she wants to hang out at his bar. He notices that she has a nervous tic where she scratches the middle of her head. As she drinks, she gets more flirtatious and blunt, leading Oscar's friend, Joel, to make a pass at her, which sends Oscar into a rage. Back home, she dreams of being a child and seeing something in a lightning storm.

When Gloria awakens, her sister tells her that a giant monster-like creature has attacked Seoul. Gloria sees footage of the monster online. After drinking with Oscar that night, she goes to the playground to think and sleeps all night. While she slept, the beast appeared again at 8:05, the same time as it did yesterday and the same time as it did 25 years ago. But this time, it just stood around and made weird hand gestures, scratching the middle of its head. By watching its other gestures, Gloria figures out that she somehow causes it to manifest when she walks through the playground.

The film follows Gloria as she tries to understand what is happening and what she can do to stop it.

The monster, while an on-the-nose metaphor for addiction, works well enough. The ones addiction hurts the worst are those we cannot see. In our lowest moments, we may not care who we hurt because the addiction is the surface problem for something more profound—some loss or some self-destructive concept of self.

The biggest mistake the film makes is trying to dot every I. The film falls into a tired routine that should be over 20-30 minutes before the end. Also, the tonal disconnect between the kaiju stuff and the dramedy about a woman getting her life together makes it difficult to stomach the destruction in South Korea because we feel like hundreds of people are dying due to a character's destructive tendencies.

Also, hire people who speak Korean if you plan to include Korean-speaking people in your film. I know the 2010s were still a bit of a representation wasteland, but the lack of care here is problematic, to say the least.

I appreciate the film's attempt to blend the fluffiness of Kaiju with serious subject matter, but the result leaves much to be desired. Its representation of the lives of people with an addiction and the people around them is sharp, but the metaphors it uses don't perform the roles the filmmakers think they do.

I, too, know the pains of an air mattress that doesn't stay inflated.


<b>*** SPOILER TALK ***</b>
Jason Sudeikis gives a troubling and accurate portrayal of a particular brand of addiction—one that stems from a sense of inadequacy or unreciprocated feelings. It's the core wound of many nice guys, incels, and other toxic men. The sense of entitlement that culture breeds in men says that if they make the right moves or say the right things, the world will reward them. But what they want isn't reciprocity — it's control. Because when they don't get what they want, they act out violently, uncaring of who they hurt in the process.

We get some of this with Tim, whose codependency is all too familiar. The behavior of the person with an addiction becomes a slight against the codependent, who wishes to heal or fix the person with an addiction but can't. The person with an addiction must heal themselves. So, the codependent takes on controlling behavior, wanting regular check-ins or some information that can give them a sense of peace or security. It may be a less nefarious form of control, but control is still the name of the game.

It's telling that the film has more to say about its male secondary characters than about its female lead.","tubi, cmc, cmc2017, kaiju",2025-05-14

<b>2004</b>
We open at a tanning salon in Naples, where Camorra members hang out. Some guys from another clan of the Camorra come in and take out the guys there, triggering the Scampia feud between members of the Camorra and secessionists.

Don Ciro is a clan middleman who distributes money to the families of imprisoned Camorra clan members. Totò is a 13-year-old grocery delivery boy whose life weaves through the clan's actions. Marco and Circ are young men running a small racket on clan turf and treat gangster life like it's <i>Scarface</i>. Franco and Roberto work in waste management, helping industries illegally dispose of dangerous materials. Pasquale is a high-end fashion tailor who works for a factory with ties to the Camorra.

We watch how the feud plays out through these five intertwining stories. 

The filmmakers based the film on a book of investigative journalism with the same name. It explores how organized crime has permeated Naples since the 18th century. The book exposed the Camorra's territory and business connections, putting the author, Roberto Saviano, under permanent police escort for safety from Camorra leaders. Similarly, rumor has it that director Matteo Garrone paid protection money to be able to make the film and include actual members of the Camorra in the movie.

In exploring these various facets of Camorra rule, we get a deep sense of how, like many political structures, it only benefits a few at the top. Otherwise, despite its promises, it becomes another system of oppression. One might think joining them will provide more protection, power, and money, but as we see, most along the hierarchy still struggle, needing more to survive than the Camorra can provide. Add to that the war with the secessionists, which most didn't sign up for, and the day-to-day becomes life or death.

The film aims for gritty realism. The music is diegetic and sparse. The cinematography is clean and documentary-style. The scenes are relatively short, giving us each story in doses. The performances are grounded—even the cartoonishly stupid Marco and Circ are believable because we've seen the movies they've seen, and we understand their ambition, however misguided.

The character I understood the most was Pasquale, who wanted to be appreciated for his work. So, when an opportunity came to teach Chinese garment workers his skills, he took it, even though the Chinese worked for a competing firm.

I don't tend to care about gangster stories because I can never find a way to relate. By focusing on the folks it does, this film humanizes the characters and allows me to feel the weight and desperation of their choices.","criterion channel, criterion, criterion challenge 2022, cc2022, coming-of-age, 1001 movies",2025-05-15

<b>April 1965</b>
Georgia native Rufus sits in a tree, binoculars in hand. He spots an Illinois license plate on a white convertible full of teenagers and signals to Lester to remove the road sign for Augusta and set up detour signs toward Pleasant Valley. When a Georgia license plate passes, they switch the signs back. They continue this routine, redirecting a red convertible driven by Terry and her hitchhiker, Tom. Pleasant Valley celebrates its centennial with guitars and banjos playing ""The South's Gonna Rise Again"" and kids waving Confederate flags. Some kids make nooses from rope and strangle a black cat. It also happens to be 100 years since the end of the Civil War.

When the teens in their white convertible drive into town, the townspeople, led by Mayor Earl Buckman, welcome them with cheers. John, one of the teens, is suspicious of the townsfolk, but they pull him, his wife Bea, and their friends David and Beverly out of the car and parade them around. While all this happens, Terry and Tom also pull in, receiving a similar treatment. When Tom asks questions, beautiful women in town flirt with him. The mayor promises two days of food and festivities, all free of charge. ""Southern hospitality"" garners a laugh from the locals. Tom tries to pass on the offer, but the mayor won't take no for an answer.

<blockquote><i>I reckon this is one celebration you'll remember as long as you live!</i></blockquote>

When everyone is settled in their rooms, Betsy, one of the locals, calls John to offer to show him around town. John lies to his wife, Bea, about it being the mayor and goes to meet with her. But Bea is onto him. So, when handsome local Harper calls her to invite her out, she takes him up on the offer. Harper leads her into the swamp, where they make out for a bit. Harper shows off his knife and cuts off her thumb. He takes her to the mayor, who claims to be a doctor. Rufus, Harper, and the mayor pin her down on the table while Rufus hacks off her arm with an axe.

That arm will be the first of many parts collected from the Yankees for the town barbecue. Will anyone make it out alive?

You gotta give to Herschell Gordon Lewis—he never pretends he's making anything other than gore and sleaze. Compared to <i>Blood Feast</i>, this movie shows a little more craftsmanship and competence—the blood is still bright red, and the gore is still goopy but stomach-churning. The kills get progressively more ridiculous, incorporating barrel rolls and giant boulders.

This film is one of the earliest examples of Hixploitation, where Yankees get stranded in the South and backward Southerners gruesomely murder them. The best-known example is probably <i>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</i>.

Unlike the ""dumb redneck"" caricature that most audiences knew, this film gives us a vengeful specter of the Confederacy. While this movie is ridiculous, especially with white Northerners being the victims, I can assure you plenty of Southerners would love to massacre their racial minority boogeyman of choice.

I love the organ stab score. How else am I supposed to know that something is amiss?

Yes, it's slow, silly, and probably offensive, but it's perhaps the most coherent movie H.G. Lewis put out.","tubi, cmc, cmc2017, folk horror: a study, hicksploitation",2025-05-15

<blockquote><i>Long, long ago, when people still believed in witches…</i></blockquote>

<b>1672</b>
In the township of Roxford, a preacher stands before a heaping pile of ash, where he reads a condemnation from the book of exorcism, cursing the witch Jennifer and her warlock father, Daniel,  to hell and damnation. He takes a brief intermission, during which a fellow walks the crowd selling popped maize. The man who condemned the two, puritanical pilgrim, Jonathan Wooley, confides in his mother the curse that Jennifer places on him—that he and all of his descendants will be unhappy in love, doomed to disastrous marriages until… Before he can finish, his fiancée, the dour Purity Sykes, chastises him for leaving her alone. Then, the preacher brings an oak tree, which he will plant over the two witches' ashes to hold their evil spirits.

We watch the next 270 years as Wooley's descendants marry cruel women and suffer for it.

<b>1942</b>
Wallace Wooley sits outside with his fiancée, Estelle Masterson, at a Roxford County Social Club party where he has announced his bid to run for governor. Wooley suspects his father-in-law-to-be, newspaper mogul J.B. Masterson, intends to use the marriage for political gain. Down the way, lightning strikes that old oak tree, freeing the spirits of Jennifer and Daniel.

<blockquote><i>'Twill be sweet to plague the human race again! […] 'Twould be nice to have lips—lips to whisper lies, lips to kiss a man and make him suffer.</i></blockquote>

Though only smokey spirits, they concoct a plan to conjure a human body for Jennifer, which she will use to torment and seduce Wallace. What torments a man more than his wife, if not a woman he cannot have? However, things may not go according to Jennifer's plan.

The film is a lighthearted screwball comedy that whizzes by with terrific pacing and comedic timing. It has a decent practical and visual effects budget and pulls off some fun bits. While this movie didn't lead to more like it, it did inspire the creation of the TV show <i>Bewitched</i>.

Of course, coming from this period, much of the humor has sexist undertones, especially with all the depictions of ""shrew"" wives. Thankfully, it doesn't harp on that for too long, but it was enough to prevent a higher rating.

Veronica Lake is perfect as the faux-ditzy witch with a scheme. Her gowns are all stunning. She's so charming!

Susan Hayward gets plenty of laughs as the ""shrew"" fiancée. Her best moments are her small bits of physical comedy and facial expressions.

The world is going insane. The sky has turned blood red. Birds are smashing into an Air Japan flight. The captain and first officer receive word that there's a suicide bomber on the plane. A hijacker, totally unrelated to the bomber, takes control of the aircraft, destroying the radio and forcing the captain to fly to Okinawa. A passenger's radio reports that Japanese and US Air Force fighters are in pursuit of a UFO.

The plane shakes violently as a glowing orb flies past the ship, blowing up the plane's controls and setting the engines on fire. The plane must make a crash landing on a deserted island. Though many people die, the hijacker escapes into the wilderness with the stewardess in tow. They come across the glowing UFO, drawing the hijacker in. On the outside of the UFO, the hijacker sees pulsating ooze in small chambers. As the hijacker watches, his head splits open, and the ooze climbs inside his skull.

What's happened to the hijacker? Will a rescue team arrive for the plane survivors? What do these aliens want? 

Dude, this movie is so outrageous. I wanted to write down every second of it because crazy shit just kept happening. The first eight minutes before the credits are near-perfect insanity. The effects are good enough for the movie's tone, especially those bloody birds.

The characters in this movie are so ridiculous. Senator Mano acts like a man-child, disgusted by every act of kindness. The psychiatrist, Momotake, thrives on chaos and pushing people to the limit. Professor Sagai, the space biologist, seems to know everything that's going on before the movie even does. I love Mrs. Neal, the one American woman who only speaks English even though she understands Japanese fluently and can only talk about her husband, who died in Vietnam when napalm blew up in his face.

<b>Bridgton, Maine</b>
David Drayton is an artist who paints images for movie posters. A framed painting of the poster from The Thing hangs on his wall, and he's working on a painting of the Gunslinger Roland from The Dark Tower series. He uses the back of his hand as his paint palette, pulling whites to outline the symbolic Rose that holds the Tower in place. Outside, a thunderstorm rages. A lightning strike knocks the power out—David, his wife, Stephanie, and their son, Billy, light candles and head downstairs. A tree crashes through the upstairs window where David painted, destroying the Dark Tower painting.

The next day, David and Billy survey the damage inside and out. The uprooted tree was the one David's grandfather planted. Their neighbor, Brent Norton, had a dead tree that fell and demolished the boathouse, so David went to Brent to exchange insurance information. Across the way, a mist descends from the Longfellow Mountains and across Long Lake. With the power still out and food going bad, David decides to head into town and grab some groceries. He brings Billy and Brent, whose car was destroyed by yet another felled tree. On the way, they pass CMP trucks and multiple military convoys from the Arrowhead base up on the mountain, a secretive military project that even the locals know little about.

At the store, David can't get cell reception. When he tries the pay phone, he also can't get through. Once inside, we meet the folks who will cause most problems throughout the movie. The store's backup generator only keeps the food cold—everything else is down, making the already long lines at checkout longer. The military police arrive to round up any soldiers on leave. The klaxon sounds. Outside, a local named Dan Miller runs towards the store, his face bloodied. Once inside, he warns everyone that there is something in the mist, and it's already taken John Lee, and they need to barricade inside. The fog rolls into town, enveloping the parking lot. A man tries to run out to his car, but once the mist overtakes him, we hear his terrified screams.

The store shakes as it is enveloped in mist. Ambrose Cornell says the mill must've blown up. Mrs. Carmody says it's the end of days. Whatever it is, it has them trapped and is trying to get in.

Frank Darabont is the director who perhaps best understands how to adapt Stephen King's stories to King's liking. Here, we have a classic King setup: a group of single-trait characters who can barely stand one other, forced to work together or die. If you've seen <i>The Walking Dead</i>, you'll recognize several faces of folks Darabont likes to work with regularly. I didn't know Andre Braugher was in this! That was a pleasant surprise.

Because we need regular action beats, people make the most belligerently stupid choices imaginable, putting themselves and others at risk. The characters are so fragile that every sentence from another person's mouth is a personal affront. I get it—it's a political allegory for the US and how the culture war has overshadowed the much greater threats to our survival. But it's so graceless and ham-fisted, spending SO MUCH TIME hitting the same beats. It's exhausting.

The movie has some fun action-horror sequences when it abandons its half-cocked moralizing. Some of the staging of the action scenes is rough. I don't care about the crappy CGI creature effects, but the cast isn't prepared to act like the CGI creature effects are in the room with them. They do better with the more ""grounded"" effects. Also, the practical gore effects help sell the danger, and some look outstanding.

Like much of King's work, the film references his other books, most notably <i>The Dark Tower</i>. I won't spoil anything, but knowing those books gives you a greater sense of what's happening in this movie.

I know some folks are divided on the ending. I think it's thematically appropriate, and it increased my score.

I appreciate Darabont, but I would be lying if I said I loved any of his movies. But that has more to do with the material he's adapting than his abilities as a director. I hear the monochrome cut of the film is superior, but I don't think I'll be checking it out anytime soon.

At night, in a small town in Italy, five young men walk together, arm in arm. They are on their way to the boardwalk, which holds the last major event of the summer: the election of Miss Mermaid 1953. There, we meet Alberto, a do-nothing daydreamer. We meet Leopoldo, an intellectual and aspiring playwright without a lick of talent. Moraldo is the youngest of the crew who longs to escape small-town life. Riccardo is a talented singer, to be sure, performing on stage, but one who dreams of making it big as a singer/actor without the chops to back it up. Fausto is the group's leader and a bit of a heartbreaker—we meet him chasing one girl, who reminds him that he's with Sanda, Moraldo's sister. They all share one thing: they're unemployed and mooching off their parents.

Sandra wins Miss Mermaid 1953. As they give her a sash, a thundering rainstorm brings everything to a sudden close as folks run inside for cover. Still, the women gather around and congratulate Sandra. Sandra grows faint and passes out. Riccardo calls for a doctor. Moraldo assures their mother that Sandra is okay. They call for Fausto. When Sandra's mother asks what is wrong, the doctor sends everyone out. Knowing what's wrong, Fausto runs home to pack his bag and run off. Molaldo catches up with Fausto and confirms his suspicions: Sandra is pregnant, and Fausto is the father.

But Francesco, Fausto's father, won't put up with his slacker son, forcing him to marry Sandra. After the wedding, Fausto and Sandra have their honeymoon in Rome. Sandra's mother rules that Fausto cannot come to live with them until he has a career. While Fausto is away, the boys continue their aimless life of cafés and pool halls, killing time until nothing is left but to go home. When Fausto returns, will he settle into his new life of monogamy and employment?

<blockquote><i>You're nobodies. All of you. What do you think you're doing?</i></blockquote>

Fellini often explores arrested development, when childhood wonder becomes an inability to grow up. Also, his leads tend to be philanderers who are afraid to settle down, stuck on the idea that whoever would stick around can tolerate some infidelity. Here, Fellini explores these with a more straightforward approach than his later films. There is no dreaminess. There is no circus (although there is a masquerade ball with a symbolic clown statue).

The boardwalk becomes the locus point where the boys' dreams seem closest to reality. It is a place they return to, able to look out into the ocean of infinite possibility. But they lack the means or drive to cross that proverbial sea, trapped by their egos. It's only Moraldo who shows any desire to make that journey.

Amy Heckerling called <i>I Vitelloni</i> ""<i>Mean Streets</i> before <i>Mean Streets</i>… [but] sadly lacking in Ronnettes songs."" The comparison is apt—the narrator is conversational, asking questions and reflecting as he breaks down who is who and what is what. As we meet our cast, the camera leans into long, moving dolly shots. The story uses montage to connect large swaths of passing time as we see our characters' lives unfold.

Even in the ending, which gives no clear resolution, we see Fellini's inability to commit. As an artist, he wishes to draw the audience in and let them take off on their own journey. And so he returns home to the same wells, unable to move on, disconnecting further from reality.","criterion channel, criterion, criterion challenge 2022, cc2022",2025-05-18

<b>Three <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> adaptations came out in 1996, and this movie is undoubtedly one of them.</b>

<blockquote><i>Are there any boundaries anymore? Are there any lines that won't get crossed by you generation of freaks?</i></blockquote>

Cold open to a dead squirrel hanging from a noose, a sign reading ""Monty Q Sucks"" written in blood pinned to its body. Cut to Times Square, where Lemmy of Motörhead introduces Tromeo and Juliet and their respective families: the Ques and the Capulets. Monty Que and Cappy Capulet used to be friends. Monty ran a film studio called Silky Films, but Cappy took all of Monty's film rights. He also stole Monty's wife, Ingrid.

At Axis Body Piercing, Tromeo's cousin Benny pierces a woman's nipples. Tromeo waxes poetic about a girl he's dating named Rosie. He heads home to the Que's shitty apartment to find Monty drunk on the floor. At the Art Club, Sammy Capulet beats up a guy for making out with his sister, Georgie, and propositions her with some meth in his underwear. Tromeo's closest friend, Murray, and Sammy get into a fight at Art Club, and Murray chops off a couple of Sammy's fingers with a paper trimmer.

Tromeo dreams of finding true love, masturbating to a porn CD-ROM where a woman tells him how in love they are and that she wants to marry him. At the Capulet mansion, Juliet strums her guitar, trapped at the house because her abusive father, Cappy, will never let her leave. Though Juliet is a macrobiotic, Cappy has promised her to the king of cold cuts, London Arbuckle. Ness, the family servant, comes by to console her by having sex with her. At night, Juliet dreams of meeting the right man.

The Capulets' masquerade ball is coming up. Tromeo will be there because Rosie got an invite. Will Tromeo and Juliet find true love? How many ways can Troma fuck with Shakespeare?

The film is absurd, going for the gross-outs and shock value humor—classic Troma nonsense. It's mostly whatever, but it got a laugh out of me every once in a while. I've documented some of the more memorable moments in the Stray Thoughts section below—not necessarily funny, just memorable.

The film occasionally blends in direct lines from the original Shakespeare or modifies them slightly to fit the context. I will give it to the actors: they give lively and knowing readings of the lines. They don't fit in with the tone of the other dialogue, but changing the circumstances in which the lines are read gives them new meaning.

The soundtrack mixes cheap 90s slacker rock, classical music, and stock Troma cheese. The recurring ""Shall we gather at the River?"" sting is funny.

Jane Jensen and Will Keenan are both hot and have legitimate chemistry, which helps this movie tremendously. From what I've read, the actors waited until after making the movie to have sex so that their scenes would have genuine sexual tension. I love reading the Gen Z reviews of how grossed out they are by the sex scenes.

If James Gunn brings half this energy to the DC Universe, it may be just what it needs to either revive it or finally kill it. Is Sean Gunn in everything he writes?

I was so on the fence with this movie, but through the magic of love and tasteless gore, it won me over. If this movie doesn't disgust you somehow, may God help you.

2025-05-21,An Angel at My Table,1990,https://boxd.it/9KNiXT,5,,"<b><a href=""https://boxd.it/q4PJa/detail"">Criterion Challenge 2022 | 49/52 | Agnes Varda's Closet Picks</a></b>

<i>An Angel at My Table</i> is a three-part film based on Janet Frame's three autobiographies. Each actress portrays Janet Frame at a different point in her life: childhood, teenage years, and adulthood, the latter making up the second and much of the third sections. The film takes its name from the second of Frame's autobiographies, which makes up the middle portion of this film.

Born in August 1924 on the predominantly rural South Island of New Zealand, Janet Paterson Frame, nicknamed Jean, was born a twin, the other dying two weeks after childbirth. Her brother, George, suffers epileptic seizures, which leads to bullying at school. Janet takes to poetry in school, so her father gets her a notebook to write more. Her friend Poppy gives her a copy of Grimm's Fairy Tales, which opens the door to her love of literature and poetry. But when Poppy teaches Janet the word ""fuck,"" her father beats her and forbids them from seeing Poppy again. When Janet graduates primary school, she is allowed free access to the Athenaeum, where she checks out all sorts of books.

The film follows Janet's sad and traumatic life as she uses writing to make sense of it and find a way to live it on her own terms.

Jane Campion read Frame's novels at thirteen. While in film school, she read <i>An Angel at My Table</i> and knew she wanted to make something based on the autobiography. Though initially designed as a TV miniseries, the project became a film. As a result, the visual language, while beautiful, is more sparse, living in the medium and close-up shots ideal for television.

The film feels like a series of vignettes, the way memory lives in slices of moments, starting and ending before we can make total sense of what we see—not in an experimental way, but simply abrupt and unadorned. The film uses sparse narration, giving us only what the film does not have the space to convey, most often lines of poetry. Otherwise, the camera is a careful and discerning observer, intensely focusing on Frame's pained silence and the depths of emotion that cannot help but come to the surface.

The film also uses moments of symbolic foreshadowing: passing the Seacliff train station, Myrtle faded in a family photograph — symbols, no doubt, from the autobiography but translated seamlessly into visual language.

Each of the three actors who portray Janet gives phenomenal performances, bringing out certain aspects the others might not, but always feel like one person. When the movie transitions to Janet as a teenager, it took me a minute to realize that a different actor was on screen.

If this movie sounds grim, you're not wrong. However, the filmmaking has such warmth and lack of self-effacement that it would punish the experience. If you've seen other Campion films, you may have a sense of darkness in mind. Campion's films have a remarkable ability to explore darkness and trauma, excavating the interiority of women—the relationships they build or, more often, endure. The movie, however, is hopeful in Frame's undying resilience.

Kerry Fox does unbelievable work. The film owes much of its power to her empathetic performance as such a singular person as Frame. Her pains became mine, and her victories, too. I don't think I've ever cheered so much when someone got laid in a movie. 

<i>An Angel at My Table</i> was Campion's breakthrough, earning her the esteem of being the first New Zealand film to be screened at the Venice Film Festival. New Zealand's most brilliant filmmaker brings the story of its most distinguished authors to life in such a moving and engrossing portrait.","criterion channel, criterion, criterion challenge 2022, cc2022, directed by women, written by women, edited by women",2025-05-20

Andy, caretaker for the Immortal Hills cemetery, shows Robert the lay of the land. Robert recently became the chairman of a committee that oversees the cemetery. In the office, Andy keeps a map of the massive cemetery that marks each gravesite—black pins indicate filled graves, and white pins indicate sold but unoccupied graves. He also shows Robert where they keep the gun—you know, just in case.

A newlywed couple, Stu and Bethie, arrive. Bethie is not amused that their wedding gift from Stu's father is a burial plot. Robert finds a space on the map for the couple and accidentally marks it with a black pin instead of a white one. Robert goes to the office to be officially sworn in. He receives a call from the undertaker that Stu and Bethie have had a car accident and died. When Robert realizes the map already has black pins for them, he gets the eerie feeling that he marked the couple for death.

To give himself some peace of mind, Robert replaces a white pin with a black one just to prove to himself that he didn't kill those kids. But we go to that person, who is sitting at his workstation mending a stuffed bear when he suddenly drops dead. Robert believes the map must contain some weird power.

So he gives it up, right? Changing the pins? He doesn't do it again, does he? Oh, he does? To be fair, he is coerced, but through convoluted reasoning.

The film gets lost in the weeds with the cemetery's committee. It's a lot of threading needles, like why Robert would take the chairman position in the first place. The movie eventually uses these relationships, though, so it's not a total waste.

The film makes some slick stylistic choices that add to the gothic, almost surreal moments as we enter Robert's dread and experience its heightening. Some shots are pretty killer! It pulls one of my favorite camera tricks for tension—I won't spoil it.

While sitting at Madame Bouche's restaurant, a man hands Max the newspaper. The newspaper details gold bars stolen last month and how the police have no clues. Max sits at a table with Riton, Riton's much younger girlfriend, Josy, and her friend Lola. Josy begs Max to see her and Lola's burlesque show. Madame Bouche tries to close the restaurant for Max and his crew, but Marco slips in. Max settles Marco's tab at Bouche's and reluctantly agrees to attend the show. 

Marinette, Josy and Lola's boss, gets mad at them for being late, but Max, who seems to know Marinette, explains. Marinette gives Max, Riton, and Marco the best seat in the house—Max would expect nothing less. While Josy and Lola perform, a woman grabs Max to speak with Angelo in Pierrot's office. Angelo and Pierrot are having a dispute regarding Angelo's drug pusher, Ramon, whom Pierrot doesn't trust. So, Max enlists Marco to take the job. While leaving, Max stops by Josy's dressing room to congratulate her, only to find her and Angelo making out. Josy confesses that she no longer loves Riton and asks him to tell Riton. 

On the way home, Max's cabbie notices an ambulance tailing them. They pull off to Max's apartment, where Max hides, waiting for the ambulance-driving hoods. When they get up to his place on the elevator, Max sees it's Ramon and an associate. Max fires off some warning shots and slips away. At a bar, Max calls Riton to warn him about Angelo, but Angelo is already there, discussing business with Riton. Max has Riton send them off and meet him at a hideout. There, Max shows Riton where he's stashed the gold bars they stole and tells Riton how careful he's been. With Angelo on them, Max suspects Riton has not been as cautious.

When Max thought he was out, the game pulled him back in. Will he make it out alive?

The film helped revitalize Gabin's career, whom the new generation of filmmakers saw as a member of the old guard. Though director Jacques Becker was reluctant to give Gabin the role, Gabin is perfect as the middle-aged, world-weary gangster looking to settle his scores and get out of the game.

For the conventional gangster, the job is life, and one that's hard to put down. For Max, the job is a job—what he does to support the life he actually wants to lead. He doesn't need any more power—he has enough and wouldn't mind losing some so that he could lose some of the attention. His crew and associates aren't his lifelong friends but merely the people he's come up with in a career that doesn't allow one to create connections. Even though he's known Riton for 20 years, their closeness is little more than proximity. That is, until Riton's life is at stake.

In this way, the film also changed how the French handled the gangster flick, blending the classic noir-esque elements with more somber meditations on aging and lost opportunities. While sitting at the club, Max points out to Riton all the older men paying for dances with the young girls, playing the fool who doesn't realize his time is up. About halfway through the movie, we get the one voiceover where Max laments the time he's invested in Riton and where it has left him in life.

It's hard to pinpoint what you might call ""style"" in the filmmaking. Its unadorned, meat-and-potato storytelling puts every moment on an equal playing field by drawing attention to none. We enter and exit Max's life, getting a glimpse of it, only knowing him through his routine and those pesky interruptions.

This movie doesn't come up much in conversations around French cinema. It emerged in a weird middle period, after WWII and before the French New Wave. I'm thankful for a random number generator that allowed me to see this seminal and under-respected film.

2025-05-27,Friendship,2024,https://boxd.it/9OsSpn,4,,"Tim Robinson is every nightmare I have about who I might secretly be. He embodies my worst tendencies and amplifies them to such an absurd degree that I have to laugh, whether it's the laughter of unbridled joy or the only catharsis my body can achieve in such a horrified state.

The film is yet another way in which he has capitalized on my terror, in which he explores the loneliness of self-centered people, the joy of being seen, and the unbearable possibility of doing the one stupid thing that will eviscerate that friendship. Austin, played by Paul Rudd, is the perfect friend to cling to because he's not necessarily a better or more enlightened person—he just pays attention to Craig (Tim Robinson), and the codependence forms from there.

Austin has a better career and circle of friends because he's better at hiding his flaws than Craig. However, Craig only sees the material ways in which Austin has successfully differentiated himself, giving Craig an aspirational ideal with no obvious way to get there.

The film's biggest flaw lies in its overreliance on classic Tim Robinson antics. It establishes a baseline of reality and then exceeds that in a way that might work for a sketch but shakes the foundations when the film needs to sustain grounded footing. That said, the movie never lost me, and I eventually found my way onto its wavelength, but it wasn't immediate.

I'm always happy to see Conner O'Malley in anything, however brief. The movie understands that his energy and Tim Robinson's are so mutually intense that O'Malley can only be in the film briefly.","chelsea theater, owen, edited by women",2025-05-25

As evening shifts to dusk, Jill Johnson walks to Dr. and Mrs. Mandrakis's home, where she will babysit for them. Jill's job should be easy-going because the kids are sick and asleep. Like any teen in the 70s, she jumps on the phone with her friend Nancy, who wants to fuck Jill's crush, Bobby, but decides to be a friend about it and abstain. So, Jill tells Nancy to tell Bobby to call Jill. While she waits, Jill does her homework.

The phone rings. No one on the other end. Jill hangs up. The phone rings again. ""Have you checked the children?"" says a man's voice on the other end. It hangs up. This routine continues with a call every 15 minutes. Finally, Jill calls the police, who tell her it's probably just some weirdo—the police get similar reports every night. Still, they say they can trace the call if she can keep the caller on the line for a minute. When he calls again, she asks if he wants to scare her. He tells her that he wants her blood all over him. The police call her back.

The call is coming from inside the house. Jill sees a shadow upstairs as a door opens, and she runs. Cut to Lt. John Clifford arriving on the scene and meeting with Lt. Charlie Garber. The children are dead and have been for several hours. They've caught the killer—an English merchant seaman named Curt Duncan—and sent him to a psychiatric facility.

<b>1978</b>
Dr. Mandrakis calls on private detective John Clifford. Curt Duncan has escaped, and the police aren't making it a priority. So, Mandrakis wants Clifford to find him. Clifford, who investigated the murders seven years ago, is more than willing to take the job.

The film's first 20-odd minutes are the real crown jewel. After Carol Kane's Scream treatment (minus the murder), we don't see her for most of the movie. But those 20 minutes, where each call gets louder than the one before, are expertly tense. If you're worried about this being a ripoff of Black Christmas, don't worry—the babysitter and the man upstairs is an older urban legend, with Foster's Release being the first movie to utilize it and establish the tropes that later films would use.

It's okay once the movie moves beyond this, but the script is significantly weaker. It's a relatively interesting concept — we know who the killer is, and we, the audience, know what he's getting up to while the investigation continues.

I appreciate that we watch Duncan try to pick up a woman and have absolutely no luck — a lazier movie would've had someone find his vague British accent charming. Instead, the movie works for its moments, even if it isn't interesting.

I also appreciate that the film is a slow-burning investigation. It doesn't cover a lot of ground. Duncan isn't a serial killer. The movie, despite appearances, is not a slasher. It's a tone that films like The Silence of the Lambs hit a better balance with. 

The score is pretty decent! Nothing outstanding, but it kicks off with what sounds like the Dolby Digital legato, which is kind of cool.

From the Inner Sanctum comes a story about the mind and its distortions. How could this lump of flesh we call a brain cause us so much suffering? Why does it drive otherwise well-adapted people to murder?

<blockquote><i>Man's struggle upward from his dark past is the struggle of reason against superstition.</i></blockquote>

On a windy evening, a distressed Paula runs through the neighborhood streets. Evelyn spots her from the window. Paul makes it inside, spotting her husband, Norman, writing in his study. Norman is a professor who studies mysticism and cultural anthropology. He adorns his office with meaningful trinkets pilfered from developing countries. Paula sneaks upstairs, setting some stray fabric in a strange ring of seashells and other materials around a portrait of her husband. Evelyn calls Norman to check on Paula, but Norman assures Evelyn that Paula has been in bed all evening.

Still, Norman goes upstairs to check on Paula. He picks up shells from her arrangement, and she shoots up from bed to warn him that it's bad luck. While leaving, he notices mud on her shoes and worries that she may still be performing the rituals of the South Sea island where he met her. There, he crossed a forbidden barrier that offended the island gods. The ring around his portrait is one of protection. When they returned from the island, the two married, to the chagrin of Ilona, who thought she had pinned Norman down.

When a colleague dies, folks suspect Paula and her supernatural beliefs. Can Norman prove Paula's innocence and find the true culprit?

The Inner Sanctum films were a small B series from Universal. Their tiny budgets and short shooting schedules were complex for director Reginald Le Borg, but that didn't stop him from trying to make the most of the materials given. The movie makes the most of its minimal lighting, especially for night shots, giving the film a noir vibe at times, which only enriches the mysterious atmosphere.

Perhaps the movie's biggest gamble was hiring Evelyn Ankers for a villainous role. She felt miscast and didn't love her performance. It also didn't help that she and Anne Gwynne, who plays Paula, were close friends. I think her performance is quite good—I suppose it helps that I don't know Ankers's work except for the couple of Universal horror films I've seen her in.

<blockquote><i>Ilona, there's something about your smile right now that reminds me of Jack the Ripper.</i></blockquote>

Norman's such an asshole! Lon Chaney Jr. does surprisingly well as a brow-beating intellectual who can't stand anyone who disagrees with him. The least believable part of the movie is that Paula, who sees how much Norman disrespects her religion, still marries him. Of course, he has his comeuppance.

Some audiences may not appreciate the small-scale and straightforward story, but this one holds up quite nicely compared to many movies from that era, especially by the third act. Yes, it's got some 40s Orientalism, but it only makes up a small portion of the film. Also, 63 minutes is just right for the story.

Down the way, a young actor named Frédérick Lemaître tries to enter the Theatre des Funabules to speak to the manager, but before he can argue further, he sees Garance and chases after her, hoping to woo her. But Garance is on her way to visit Pierre-François Lacenaire, who works as a scrivener but has more sinister plans for society.

At the Theatre des Funabules, they sell two seats: the boxes and ""paradise,"" the upper balcony. Those who can afford neither are left with the mime named Baptiste, the son of the barker. While Garance and Lacenaire stand in the crowd, a man accuses Garance of stealing his gold watch, calling for the police. However, Baptiste, who witnessed the whole thing, reenacts the crime, thereby exonerating Garance. Frédérick has made his way into the theater to speak to the theater director. The crowd in ""Paradise"" is rowdy, yelling at the stage and cracking jokes. But their enthusiasm drives the theatre director to continue.

The film follows Garance and the men who attempt to court her in their inimitable ways, as well as have their exploits throughout the film.

<blockquote><i>Listen to the Gods! I used to laugh like that.</i></blockquote>

In March of 1945, Allied troupes had pushed Nazis out of most of Europe. In two months, WWII will end, effectively driving the remaining German resistance out. It was in that month that Children of Paradise premiered, marking the return of French cinema and the death of its golden age.

The title of the film takes on a double meaning. From the summary above, you can deduce one meaning: the children of paradise are the impoverished who crave the excitement of the theater. More directly, the children are the actors themselves, in the film and for the film, who all wish to be seen and rewarded with the crowd's applause. In this way, the film is a love letter to a time in French history, as well as to the audiences who turned out in droves to see it. Their enthusiasm kept the film screening at Madeleine Theatre for over a year and kept it in theaters for decades after.

The filmmaking is grand and romantic, utilizing thousands of extras to populate the sets built for streets and theaters. The costumes are perfect, both those on the street and those on stage, creating a sense of time and place. Being in monochrome, it's easier now than ever to feel like the film is a portal back in time. It helps that Baptiste, Frédérick, and Pierre-François are all based on real people, so the script has plenty of rich detail to bestow on them.

While the runtime may be intimidating, the film is divided into two parts, with a seven-year gap between the events. Additionally, much of the runtime is dedicated to watching the stage performances and the audience's responses, so it all feels well-balanced.

 My favorite characters are the trio of writers who complete each other's sentences. They're almost like fairy tale creatures!

<b>Saturday, April 4th, 6:00 PM</b>
Jef Costello lay in his humble Paris apartment in stasis. He wears a full suit and black shoes— his hair is slicked back. A lit cigarette bellows meager plumes of smoke against the dark wood interior. A bird in a cage, its coat pale and grey, meeps mildly as rain tickles the windows and cars whisper past. The camera lens fisheyes, the edges of the screen pulling in toward us, distorting the total image into an unusual roundness. Jef rises as though something outside summons him and dons his trenchcoat and fedora.

Outside, he surveys the busy street, spotting a man leaving his car. Jef enters the car and retrieves from his coat a ring with dozens of keys. Patiently, he tries each key, one by one, until he finds one that will start the ignition. As he arrives, another car pulls up across the street. The woman eyes him, nodding, and drives on. Jef pulls into a garage, where a man silently replaces the tags before handing Jef a handgun. Jef pays the man with a wad of cash. As night falls, he arrives at an apartment building, where he rings Jane's buzzer. Jane awakens and lets him in. The two agree as to what time Jef arrived and what time he will have left by.

Jef leaves the apartment a few minutes later and arrives at a hotel. He enters a room where men sit around a table littered with cards, cash, and cigarette butts. Again, he sets a time when he will return, 15 minutes after he has left Jane's. He parks down the way from a nightclub called Martey's. He slips in, dodges into the bathroom, dons white gloves, slips through the back doors and passageways of the club, and arrives at a private office. There sits Marty, the nightclub owner. Jef tells Marty that he will kill him and then shoots him with three bullets. The club's piano player, Valérie, walks by when she hears a noise. Jef opens the door to meet her face. He slips off his white gloves and leaves, spotted by several witnesses as he makes his hurried exit back to the car.

<blockquote><i>I never lose. Not really.</i></blockquote>

Will Jef Costello escape the police this time? Or did he finally make his career-ending mistake?

<blockquote><i>— What do you think of Costello?
— I don't think.</i></blockquote>

The film is one of the most influential in the crime thriller genre. From Ronin to John Wick, Taxi Driver to Heat—they all point back to Jef, who is the pure, undiluted hitman who only seems to come to life when it comes to doing the job and doing it to perfection. In Drive, Ryan Gosling plays it straight. In John Woo's The Killer, Chow Yun-Fat dreams of being Alain Delon in this movie. Tom Cruise in Collateral provides a deconstruction of the archetype and the loss of a soul that accompanies it—perhaps the key to Michael Mann's outcasts lies in Jef Costello.

The organ-heavy score works for me! It has that Baroque fugue-like layering that keeps in step with the film's tension. It reminds you that you're rooting for the killer for no other reason than it's his story you entered first. But all the different stories have been coming and going, their intersections merely blocks of time for Jef to account for and moments seared to memory for them. I like the way its motifs play out in the more ""noir jazz"" parts of the score.

The detective who refuses to give up on Jef being the killer possesses the same temerity and stillness, fully confident in their actions because nothing has led the men to question them. But we, the viewer, can see what they won't admit to others, or perhaps even to themselves—words are just words, no matter how many or few you use. It's all ""by the books,"" however, that looks for a hitman, and indeed not how US police act. 

<blockquote><i>The truth is not what you say. It's what I say—whatever the methods I use to get to it.</i></blockquote>

I think I have to say it: this is a technically perfect movie. It has not a second wasted, not a misplaced shot—just a masterclass of tension and pacing. Even when I wanted to look away, I couldn't. It feels timeless — I could see a director making this movie today and changing very little beyond the camera lenses. I honestly didn't think I would like this movie as much as I did.

<blockquote><i>— I never talk to a man holding a gun.
— Is that a rule?
— A habit.</i></blockquote>

Alain Delon is perfect for this role. No one would call him a world-class actor, but the man can walk around and look pretty. What doesn't get talked about enough is how much cooler Caty Rosier is. ","criterion channel, criterion, criterion challenge 2022, cc2022, 1001 movies, film noir",2025-05-30

An empty road at night glows red—the traffic light, the cocktail sign, the neon Santa, and the blood on Denise's shirt. She rides the bus alone, her bloodied hands holding herself, trying to hide what is obvious. She pulls a gun.

Carla wakes up in a sweat, pushing herself against her bedroom wall, staring at the door. ""She's coming."" An airplane takes off. The room shakes violently. The plane crashes, and the dead litter the ground. Denise sits in a detached plane seat in the sand, totally unscathed, the sole survivor. She stares at a man torn in half with his entrails pouring out of him. His eyes open.

The telephone rings. Blake awakens and answers the phone to Carla, who asks the name of the producer she's doing a commercial for. Blake tells her it's Denise. And if she's taking a flight this morning. ""Something's going to happen."" Carla sees the plane take off. Denise arrives at the hospital. The doctor, Brian, worries she might have survivor's syndrome. Denise can figure out why she didn't get billed for a dress she bought. But she can't figure out how she's still alive.

<blockquote><i>Those computers—they may make a mistake, but they'll find you.</i></blockquote>

While leaving the hospital through the back door, she feels a strange presence. At the docking bay, a girl stands staring at Denise, drenched in water. Denise tries to help the girl when the brakes cut on a delivery truck. It nearly cuts into Denise before she sees it and rolls away to safety. Similar experiences keep happening to Denise. Something is trying to kill Denise.

The film appears to have a decent budget. The acting is solid, especially Anita Skinner, who pulls off traumatized but still horny quite effectively (is that Bette Midler's thing??). The dialogue between Denise and Brian has a playful quality that I found both corny and charming.

This director also did <i>Night of the Comet</i>, which I was a big fan of. He also made a 2000s movie named <i>Ratz</i> about two girls who turn their rats into boys. Of course, it's on my watchlist.

This is often compared to <i>Final Destination</i>, but it also has significant <i>It Follows</i> vibes! And I would say it's at least as good as that movie.

Ruth Willmore is dying—neither the pills in her medicine cabinet nor the crucifix hanging over her bedroom wall will change that. Her daughter, Charlotte, has been a talented cellist since childhood, gaining admission to a prestigious music school in Boston called Bachoff. However, when her mother fell ill, Charlotte gave it up to care for her. When Ruth finally dies, it leaves Charlotte with a decade of bad memories, scars on her wrists, and uncertainty for her future. She reaches out to Anton, the head of Bachoff, in hopes of joining him and his wife, Paloma, wherever they are scouting for new talent. Following them takes her to Shanghai.

Once in Shanghai, Charlotte attends a finalist concert whose winner will receive a full scholarship to Bachoff. Judging is Elizabeth Wells, or Lizzie, who has taken Charlotte's place as Anton's star pupil. Charlotte is a massive fan of Lizzie, and it turns out that Charlotte inspired Lizzie in her younger years. Lizzie and Charlotte flirt at the recital. Later, the father of one of the finalists vomits and collapses. A local reports a contagion in Hunan that is causing people to hemorrhage. Anton and Lizzie were just scouting there. The two perform a duet, go out clubbing, and have sex at their hotel.

<blockquote><i>You have been and will always be the person who makes my heart skip a beat when you play.</i></blockquote>

Lizzie is going on a trip through rural China to get away from all the pressure and invites Charlotte to come along. But the next morning, Lizzie is feeling sick. Will this be Charlotte and Lizzie's chance to let loose? Did Lizzie contract that Hunan disease?

The film explores the role music plays in people's lives. For prodigies and preternaturally gifted individuals, their community expects them to play their part and refine their sound for the world. The notion of playing for oneself, one's pleasure, becomes a distant memory, if ever a memory at all. Charlotte had the opportunity to relearn that when left alone. Lizzie hopes to have it someday, but knows that won't come anytime soon.

The film also plays with the classic lesbian trope: do I want to fuck you or to be you? Why not both? The intercutting of the sex scene and the cello duet with Charlotte climaxing as the song finishes is *chef's kiss*. It's cool that Allison Williams and Logan Browning learned to play cello for the movie. They don't do anything mindblowing, but they're good enough to sell it.

The perspective on rural China through the eyes of two American women isn't entirely tasteless, but there's more than a hint of ""this food is gross, this bus is gross."" Lizzie speaks Mandarin, but she never uses it, putting Charlotte in positions where she yells at Chinese people in English to do what she says, even though they don't understand her.

I've hinted at it above, but it's worth stating explicitly: this film has people vomiting, defecating, and all sorts of gross stuff, and the camera does not look away that often. So, if those things bother you, either be ready to close your eyes or don't bother.

If you've seen horror movies, you might be able to predict some of the directions the film takes. It also makes some choices that I would not call coherent. You'll either be on its wavelength or not.

No one who worked on this movie knows music. Like, at all. It's kind of funny when the film gives up before it makes it too obvious.

But what Baltimore doesn't know is that Whitlock is a diva. Little does Honey know that, among the hotel and theater staff, is a group of underground filmmakers armed with guns and explosives. They kidnap Honey to force her to star in their movie.
<blockquote><i>We're gonna make our first film, Miss Whitlock, and nobody's gonna stop us. Lots of kids dream of making a movie, but only the ones willing to die for it succeed.</i></blockquote>The film is loosely based on Patty Hearst's kidnapping by left-wing guerrillas, except they want to make a movie instead of leveraging her family's political influence. Hearst even makes a cameo! The movie is classic Waters raunch, where everyone's an asshole. It's also Waters giving us his worldview through the Sprocket Holes. Perhaps in the year 2000, when major studios had ""indie"" offshoots to put out ""indie"" films, this movie didn't hit.

He sells his truffles to Amir, a snot-nosed distributor. One night, in the din of coyote howls, a car approaches Rob's shack. They knock down the door, attack Rob, and steal the pig. With no other choice, Rob calls Amir to give him a ride into town. Following a trail of drug addicts leads Rob and Amir into Portland and to an underground fight club where people pay to beat up high-end chefs. Rob writes his real name on the scoreboard. He is Robin Feld, a once-renowned chef in Portland.

Will Robin's name be enough to get around in this city?

You live your life for them, and they don't even see you. You don't even see yourself. We don't get a lot of things to really care about.</i></blockquote>

Like Rob, this film has an identity crisis. It wants to blend genres, but it also wants to be IMPORTANT. Both Rob and Amir have loss in their lives—Amir lost his mother to suicide, and Rob lost his wife. Rob has given in to fatalism, while Amir hides his pain behind a veneer of vanity. Beyond that, milking this movie for a deeper meaning is like hunting for truffles without a pig.

Look, I love Nic Cage as much as the next person, probably more. But he, as well as everyone else in this movie, is a cardboard cutout, not a character. I appreciate that he spends most of the movie covered in blood.

I love the pig too — would literally go to war for it.

When I saw this during the pandemic, I gave it a higher score because I didn't want to appear pretentious. Also, to be honest, I zoned out for half the movie. But maybe the movie that uses a dead serious Lacrimosa sting is the pretentious one. This is a very silly movie.

A women's prison receives a commendation for their work, only for Nami and Yuki to stage a breakout. Yuki gets her period, putting the dogs on their scent. One gets Yuki, but Nami beats it away with a stick. Just when they seemed cornered, a flying bird distracts the shooter, allowing Nami to wrestle him and Yuki to bash him in. But it's not enough, and the guards find them and bring them back.

The captain punishes the guards for their slackness and the prisoners by reducing their meals for a week. They throw all the food in the trash, causing the prisoners to riot. Meanwhile, Nami lands Yuki in solitary confinement, tied up, communicating through butting their heads on the wall. Nami can get out if she swears never to try and escape again.

How did Nami get here in the first place? It started with a boy named Sugimi, a narcotics officer on the Drugs Squad, who took her virginity. He asked Nami to help him with a drug smuggling ring infiltration that immediately goes wrong, and the drug dealers take turns SAing her. It turns out that Sugumi was only using her to get a bribe from the yakuza. Nami tries to take her revenge by stabbing Sugumi, but the police stop her and arrest her.

Now, while in prison, Sugumi plans to stage Nami's murder and free himself of her once and for all. Will Nami be able to escape these sadistic prison guards and vengeful inmates and enact her revenge?

The camera work is quite agile and expressive, making even the smallest scene dynamic. Some moments are surreal, with phantom wind and near-choreographed movement. The color is also stellar! The shower fight scene is an all-timer. There's also an unusual scene where the women line up nude, going through a jungle gym of pipes so the guards can ensure they're not smuggling contraband inside them.

I already knew Meiko Kaji was a badass from <i>Stray Cat Rock: Delinquent Girl Boss</i>, where she outshone Aikko Wada in every scene. Here, she gets to take center stage, kicking ass and pleasuring women into submission.

I wanted to revisit this movie since my tastes have changed in the couple of years since I initially watched this. While I appreciated it the last time, I don't think I fully realized how special this movie is. This movie might be the quintessential women-in-prison film and one of the coolest exploitation movies from the era.

In an underground chamber, behind a gate, bound in chains, is Nami, put in solitary confinement after the events of the previous film. In her mouth is a spoon, which she grinds against the stone floor. Slowly, she turns the spoon into a shiv. After a year in solitary confinement, the guards come to tell her about an inspection by a prominent official, which means they will bring her out of solitary confinement for the day. The Warden arrives to gloat over his victory over Nami and to announce his promotion. The guards hose her down for about 1 minute of screentime; it's ridiculous.

The inspector perceives an immaculately managed prison. The women turn in shock—Scorpion has returned. The Warden tries to keep the inspector uninterested in Nami. Still, he cannot help but gloat for a moment, giving Nami her opportunity to go for the Warden's other eye (she had taken one in the previous movie). She pierces the sunglasses, but the Warden pulls away in time to only get a scratch on the face. The inspector is so stunned that he urinates on himself, stirring the women's laughter. They incite a riot, but the guards quickly take control.

To punish them for starting the riot, the prison sends the women to a brutal labor camp. They keep Nami separated, bound to a cross, guarded by dogs, lest she inspire further revolt. To further humiliate Nami, four guards take turns SA-ing her in front of the prisoners. Nami knows what she must do.

Will Scorpion be able to reach the Warden and take him out? Will the traumatized inmates give her the chance?

Everything I said about style in my previous review applies here. The visuals and cinematography are even more expressive here—a larger budget and longer schedule allowed for more experimentation. The gore is also way more intense. Some kills are slasher-movie intense. The movie plays with time by making scenes of torture drawn out and repetitive so that they feel endless, and we are stuck with Nami. 

I love the 4th wall break when the oboe player looks at the camera and pulls her head in toward it. 

Scorpion has become a legend when we see her again. She feels like Clint Eastwood in a Western—the way she owns the space is stunning. Meiko Kaji is a fucking boss.

The movie seems to suggest that some women deserve to be in prison. But it also says that women commit crimes because of men. And no man in this movie isn't a disgusting piece of shit. Maybe I shouldn't try to find a moral in a women-in-prison film.

The moment when the audio goes silent is so shocking. I don't think we needed another SA as a motivating scene, but I guess it's thankfully not graphic.

The movie makes a choice about 35 minutes in that immediately bumped up my review score. This movie is wild!

It's 5 AM near Trieste, Italy. Lieutenant Colonel Austin Travis leads a US Special Forces Counterterrorist Strike Team on a Chechen mafia safe house. Their objective is to recover a stolen Soviet nerve toxin called DZ-5. Travis runs in with a bowie knife, stabbing Chechen dudes in the neck. His team follows close behind. When the team reaches the demarcated location, they find the room empty. In case it wasn't clear, the text comes on the screen to tell us that the team did not recover the DZ-5.

Three months later, Dr. David Grant, a consultant to US Army Intelligence, flies a Beechcraft C33 Debonair for flight training, landing at Fredericks Field in Maryland. He's about to take off for his first solo flight when Gail drives up with a phone call. US authorities captured terrorist leader El Sayed Jaffa at his daughter's wedding. 

Ten days later, in London, a suicide bomber enters a Mariott and detonates himself. In Athens, Greece, a Boeing 747 with over 400 passengers takes off. Several men take that plane hostage, demanding El Sayed Jaffa's release. Grant and Travis attend a Pentagon meeting on how to approach the situation. The team thinks they should accept the terrorists's demands and wait until they land, but Grant doesn't believe they should wait because they probably have DZ-5. So they're going to have to do a mid-air insertion.

Travis' team will lead the operation, and they pull Grant onto their team for some reason. Will they be able to save the day?

I love an action movie that treats you like a total idiot.

I love the mid-90s future tech—old Macs with low-res polygons, audio equipment with waveforms flapping around, and so on. If you're into planes, this movie has several. I found a page about them on the <a href=""https://impdb.fandom.com/wiki/Executive_Decision"">Internet Movie Plane Database</a> 

The cast is stacked with memorable faces: Halle Berry, John Leguizamo, Oliver Platt, Joe Morton, Trump's second wife, Marla Maples. This is the straightest I've ever seen BD Wong.

My favorite aspect of the script is how often people disagree with one another, yet it doesn't escalate into a fight. That shit is so exhausting, and the movie is better for it.

My biggest complaint is the movie's length. It's decent with the action beats and offers a surprise or two along the way, but my eyes glazed over for large swaths of the movie. The second hour is better than the first.

I watched this movie in two parts. I'm glad I did — I was able to enjoy the latter half much more. This movie is still dumb as hell, but it's pretty entertaining.","cmc, cmc2017",2025-06-05

Peter and his son, Robin, race each other, swimming from the Mediterranean onto rightfully Palestinian shores, where the two have lived since Peter's wife and Robin's mother died. Peter plans to move back to Chicago with Robin, where Robin can attend a school for similarly gifted children. Peter's colleague, Ben, is with them to say his goodbyes after 20 years of working together. Ben makes a call, and suddenly, the waiter has two bullet holes in him from a shooter on the roof. Motorboats come in from the sea armed with machine guns. Peter escapes in a motorboat, but the armed men blow it up. Ben gets Robin to safety in a car that drives away, then congratulates the armed men. Peter emerges from the water, sees Ben with the armed men, and shoots Ben in the arm.

One year later, in Chicago, Gillian walks the beachfront with her friend, La Rue, studying for an upcoming history exam. La Rue quizzes her. Gillian hears the name Raymond and tells La Rue not to tell her the answer. But La Rue didn't say anything. A sweaty, bespectacled weirdo named Raymond tails them for a bit before making a call on a payphone to Mr. Johnson, saying he's located a psychic who can help him find his son. A wiretap on the payphone leads to Ben's agents, who trace the call to Peter's location. Peter catches on and evades the agents raiding his hotel room, swinging from buildings in just his boxers. He holds a family at gunpoint while he gets clothes and dyes his hair.

At Gillian's high school, a woman named Hester demonstrates her psychic abilities by moving a toy train on a train set with her mind. Ellen, a spokesperson for the Paragon Institute, asks Gillian to give it a try, and she moves the train effortlessly. While moving the train, she has a vision of a bloodied body, sending the train off the rails. Cheryl later bullies Gillian at lunch, and Gillian lets slip that Cheryl is pregnant. Cheryl grabs Gillian's wrists in anger. Gillian begs her to let go. Cheryl's nose starts to bleed, and Gillian runs.

Will Peter find his son, or will Ben and his network take him out first? Will Gillian find a way to understand her psychic powers? What's the deal with Paragon?

Boy, this movie sure is chaotic! I blame the fact that it's based on a book — it feels like they tried to mine the book for good parts and were too precious with the details. It's going for comedy at times—that sort of light touch one puts on an action flick to ease the tension.

Charles Durning is terribly miscast, only because we're supposed to believe for part of the movie that he's a good guy.

I wish the movie didn't spend so much time trying to explain telepathy. Was it so uncommon in film that we needed yet another school of thought?

De Palma is using his hookups to get John Williams on the score, which helps the energy. It doesn't always work, but when it hits, it hits.

Kirk Douglas monkeying around on fire escapes and across L tracks is so funny. I mean, the dude is ripped in this movie. I haven't seen many of his films, but he seems like he's having a blast in this one.

This movie is quite uneven, but I enjoyed parts of it so much! I guess the gorehounds were bored, but I was into it. An extra half star just for that ending!","cmc, cmc2017",2025-06-05

A young boy named Johann rides his bike into his village and to the church, where he works as an altar boy. He hears the bell ring and grabs the rope to stop it, only to find it soaked with blood. Glancing upwards, he sees the blood pooling around the porthole through which the rope falls. He goes up the stairs and into the bell tower. His screams alert a priest, who runs into the church to find the frightened boy, unable to explain, covered in blood, running away. The priest follows the trail of blood up to the bell. A shoe drops out. Then, a woman's body, her neck torn into at two points.

Rain turns to snow and snow to spring—a year has passed since Dracula drowned in Dracula: Prince of Darkness. Monsignor Ernst Muelle rides into the village on a carriage to check on them. In the church, the priest performs perfunctory Mass rites for an empty sanctuary. After mass, he hits the pub, leaving Johann to meet the Monsignor's arrival. Johann is mute and unable to voice where the priest is, but points towards the pub. There, the villagers explain that they no longer attend mass because the shadow of Dracula's castle touches it. The Monsignor tries to assure them that Dracula is dead, but they still sense evil there.

To assuage their fear, the Monsignor intends to climb to the castle to exorcise its residual evil, bringing the priest with him. The sun begins its decline, and the horrified priest is unable to continue. The Monsignor leaves him to continue the rest of the way. As clouds form and lightning strikes, the Monsignor performs the exorcism. The storm sends the priest running. He trips and falls down the mountain, hitting his head and falling atop where Dracula is frozen. The blood from his wound drips down the rocks and onto Dracula's lips, awakening him once more.

<blockquote><i>When shall we be free of his evil?</i></blockquote>

The film explores the tension between the church and the world. Central to the story is the Monsignor, quite set in his ways and the ways of the Catholic church. Paul, a character we meet after Dracula's awakening, is an atheist who takes pride in his honesty, even when it gets him into trouble. The Monsignor stands on his beliefs and challenges a town that is scared but doing okay with an exorcism. In the process, his stubborn will awakens Dracula.

But don't worry, oh, ye faithful — if you've seen enough Dracula movies, you know that God has dominion over Draculas, and it is Paul's lack of belief that the film challenges. Faith is not something you can build out of rites and rituals—there must be something central that belongs to the individual. And what better challenge than a dang old Dracula trying to fuck your girlfriend?

<blockquote><i>You should swear by the Almighty God, but you have denied yourself this.</i></blockquote>

The film practically teases us with Lee's appearances, offering us glimpses in small measure. If I recall correctly (probably not, let's be real), Lee was pretty over this series by this point, so this may be him giving the movie the bare minimum. The man has never turned down a role, it seems.

Barbara Ewing is the proper star of this movie, giving us the most nuanced performance as the barmaid, Zena. Everyone is walking around in their stuffy 19th-century postures, and she plays it so effortlessly that she feels like an honest-to-god person.

The movie feels the absence of Peter Cushing, but it doesn't drag the film down too terribly. It's also the first without Terence Fisher directing. Freddie Francis does fine, bolstered, no doubt, by Hammer's in-house production team.

As Hammer continued making films, they became less shy with the sexual innuendos and undertones. Dracula has always been horny, but they've never been this explicit about it.","cmc, cmc2017, vampires, britsploitation, gothic horror",2025-06-06

Kristi Jones runs with a gang that participates in street fights to earn money for her sister Karen's college tuition. After winning a fight, Detective Nick DiMarco rides up to stop it. He only catches Kristi. The gang goes to Karen's college to help bail Kristi out of jail, concealing that Kristi was involved in a fight.

Anna is worried about her husband, Paul. He used to be so sweet, but he's changed. He hurts Anna. It began when he quit being a mechanic and started competing in death matches. Her therapist thinks she should leave Paul. It isn't until Paul SAs her that she finally leaves him. 

Paul, known on the streets as Stingray, loses it, his Mommy abandonment issues going into hyperdrive, and he starts to abduct and torture women who resemble Anna. DiMarco is on the case. Things get personal for Kristi when Paul targets Karen.

Cynthia Rothrock is not a great actor, but she can fight and possesses a considerable amount of on-screen charisma. That goes for the rest of the cast, too — these folks want to make a good martial arts movie and are putting their all into it. Most of them aren't actors but martial arts students, so yeah, of course their acting sucks.

The blend of martial arts and serial killer movies is an unusual choice, but it mostly works!

Unlike Godfrey Ho's most popular Z-movies, this film doesn't incorporate footage from other movies. However, he recut the movie with an additional Chinese character storyline for Asian markets, labeling it Bloody Mary Killer.

The year is 2017, the near future! Sam, a recycling exec, rides home in his futuristic car thingy while his Cherry 2000 puts on her lipstick and red dress. He enters with a bouquet of plastic flowers, and they share a metal canister of wine. She starts the dishes and begs Sam to kiss her, so they start going hot and heavy in the kitchen. The dishwashing apparatus is overflowing, sending waves of bubbles onto the floor. They playfully roll around in it until the liquid causes Cherry to short-circuit.

Sam takes Cherry to a maintenance specialist, who is unable to repair her but gives Sam her chip containing her vocal patterns, reflexes, and personality. Unfortunately, manufacturers discontinued the Cherry 2000 model in favor of more, uh, ""direct"" companion bots. The repairman shows Sam some updated models, but for Sam, it's Cherry or Bust. With Cherry's chip, Sam can hear her voice but nothing more. The repairman locates a defunct warehouse in Zone 7. Sam can hire a tracker named Johnson, located in the town of Glory Hole, to guide him through the area and protect him. By the way, the repairman has a Gort from The Day the Earth Stood Still and Robby the Robot from Forbidden Planet!

So, Sam packs his guns and hits the road. Glory Hole has a Western vibe, with horses on the street and business signs swinging in the wind. Among those businesses is E. Johnson, the tracker who never says no. But when he enters, he discovers Johnson is a girl, but she's got the experience. The only problem is that she's demanding that Sam tag along. Though reticent, when he sees he has no better options, he jumps into Johnson's modded '65 Mustang and races into the wasteland.

Will Sam get his Cherry 2000? Or will he learn to have feelings for a ""real"" woman?

The film uses the companion bots as a means of exploring how American manufacturing traded quality for cheaper, outsourced labor, resulting in products that give out more quickly. In this reality, people must recycle everything due to economic downturns and supply shortages. Since this movie came out, we've experienced greater and greater planned obsolescence, and with the tariff malarky in the USA, we may see a greater emphasis on recycling consumer goods.

<i>Blade Runner 2049</i> explored a similar concept, and both films indulge in the male gaze while discussing how our culture commodifies women's bodies. At least <i>2049</i> had the intent to interrogate it despite failing to do so. The 80s were a strange nexus with their depictions of female sexuality. On the one hand, sex comedies and slashers became more mainstream, increasing the amount of nudity we saw on average. But at the same time, the AIDs epidemic and Reagan's family values put massive restrictions on what sexuality could look like, reinforcing many heteronormative ideals. That comes through in this film through the choice of the ""real"" thing over the robot and the restoration of the nuclear family. The women who survive are the ones who adopt traditional gender roles, including making food, tending to the house, and performing other unpaid domestic labor disguised as ""wifely duties.""

Coworkers approach Sam about going to the Glu Glu Club after work. At the club, women approach men for sexual acts, but the bureaucracy and paperwork involved in even a one-night stand are complicated, where every sexual act performed must be stipulated beforehand. In a post MeToo world, this joke about shared consent feels off—I'm genuinely not sure what it's trying to say other than, ""Women are too much work! You gotta care about their wants, too!"" The men talk about sex bots like car boys talk about their cars.

<blockquote><i>Whatever happened to pride in workmanship?</i></blockquote>

The film feels a little like <i>Tank Girl</i> in its budget post-apocalypse aesthetic, with heavy doses of <i>Mad Max</i> in the wasteland. The aesthetics sort of taper off once Sam and Johnson hit the road. The first ten to fifteen minutes are where the best stuff is. Although at the Glory Hole Hotel, the innkeeper keeps a cat in a watercooler jug—I'm assuming she put it in there as a small kitten, and it grew too big to escape. It's so upsetting!

The car and plane stunts are pretty fun! They don't do a whole lot for me, but they add to the spectacle and grounding this movie's reality.


<b>*** Actor Talk ***</b>
I'm only realizing now just how weird Melanie Griffith's acting career has been. Also, I'm not sure, but it looks like she's wearing a hoodie with the word 'DIGNITY' stenciled on it. It's very Target-brand feminism, and I'm not even sure how intentional the feminism is.
Laurence Fishburne appears as a lawyer at the Glu Glu Club, who drafts the contract for Bill and Amy for a one-night stand.
Robert Z'Dar looks absolutely unhinged. Unbuttoned leather button-up tee, short shorts, boots, and a neon green tool belt full of tools.
It feels weird seeing Tom Thomerson as the bad guy when he was the lead in <i>Trancers</i>, a similar movie to this in that the first act is where the best stuff is.

The family responsible for these brutal crimes was forever to be known as ""The Devil's Rejects.""</i></blockquote>

Tiny Firefly drags the naked body of a dead woman through the woods, her skin pale and bloodstains covering the inside of her thighs—a dozen or more cars race by, entering the Firefly family farm. Inside the house, Otis lay sleeping, cuddling with another naked dead woman, her body covered in cuts, nicks, and blood. Baby and Mother Firefly also lay sleeping, awakened by the sheriff's department over their loudspeaker. The Fireflies arm themselves, taking on the police.

In the fallout, the police kill Rufus and take Mother into custody. Otis and Baby abandon their basement full of kidnapped victims, escaping through the sewer drain pipe. Down the way, Baby plays dead in the street, and a woman stops to help her. Otis stabs the woman in the back, and he and Baby steal her car to escape. Meanwhile, the police find evidence in the house that implicates Captain Spaulding, the clown who runs The Museum of Monsters & Madmen, in the family's murders.

The film follows Spaulding, Otis, and Baby as they evade the police and engage in their bizarro form of hijinks.

I didn't care much about <i>House of 1000 Corpses</i>. This movie abandons all the funhouse elements for torture porn. Most of the movie is a boring parade of, ""Woah, isn't this fucked up? Aren't you disgusted?"" And maybe I'm jaded, but without any structure or character, it's mostly tedious.

What this improves upon is the consistency of style and aesthetic that <i>1000 Corpses lacked</i>. Rob Zombie is at his best when he transcends his genre trappings—<i>Halloween 2</i> makes some wild swings by exploring Michael's internal reality and developing the character in ways no one else considered. Here, we get a tiny hint of that with the dream sequences, but the dreams are nearly indistinguishable from the rest of the movie.

The police interview a movie critic, believing his knowledge will give the police a hint as to the Firefly's motivations. It's Rob Zombie's chance to make fun of the critics who care about movies. I guess he didn't expect most critics to enjoy this movie.

To get a hint at the movie's sense of humor, there's a scene where Cutter gets up to use the bathroom. We hear him sigh and see brown liquid hitting a white surface—pull back to coffee pouring into a white mug. Or, there's a scene where the three killers are eating tutti-fruit ice cream, and I guess the joke is, ""They're just like me; they like ice cream too!""

I know many horror fans are into this movie. It could be that I'm losing my affinity for horror. Or maybe I prefer the original trash to neo-trash pastiche. I also like horror movies that don't waste 2 hours of my life for 30 minutes of story.

It features her grandmother, Iris, as a young woman in a Needle-adjacent restaurant called Sky View, watching everyone die in horrible and convoluted ways before dying herself. She decides she needs to go home and track down her estranged grandmother to get some answers. She may not like what she learns, because it involves the death of everyone in her family. Will she be able to save them?

Like all the <i>Final Destination</i> movies, the deaths are wild Rube Goldberg machines that are fun to see play out until the visceral CGI gore fest of the death itself. I'm definitely getting softer in my years, because this movie grossed me out in an unfun way. I didn't want to see anyone die—what the hell was I thinking going to this?

I would say that this is a better movie than <i>Freaks</i>, which was also directed by the same people. However, it still suffers from trope-heavy family dynamics that shorthand relationships instead of developing them.

<b>The end of the fifteenth century</b>
Rumors of Adele Karnstein being a witch come to a head when Count Franz Humboldt dies, and Adele is the primary suspect. They capture Adele and take her to trial, where they will test her to determine if she is a witch. Helen, Adele's oldest daughter, knows the actual murderer and sneaks into the castle to tell the new Count, Franz's brother, the truth and free her mother. The Count demands sexual favors in return.

Meanwhile, the Count's nephew, Kurt, and Von Klage capture Adele's younger daughter, Lisabeth, and the trial continues in the Count's absence, wherein they trap Adele in a wall of fire—if she escapes, she's a witch—if she dies, she is innocent. Adele curses the Humboldt family, promising pestilence on the land, and Helen accuses the Count of adultery for not stopping it. Adele's hair catches fire, and the flames consume her. The Count chases Helen and throws her off a cliff to her death to save his reputation.

Years pass, and Kurt forcefully takes Lisabeth to be his wife. A plague takes over the village, killing the Count. One stormy night, the rain unearths Helen's grave, and a woman bearing a striking resemblance to her appears at the castle.

The film has plenty of vibes. Filming in Massimo Castle also adds to the texture, giving everything a decrepit and haunted feeling. Then, we get some sick crypts, and I'm fully in. I love where the Count thinks a body is coming to life, but it's just full of rats. The movie takes a bit to get to the more interesting parts of the story. But when it does, it's hella Gothic and brooding.

The script is pretty weak, with all the reveals happening through leaden dialogue. I found a Spanish version of the movie, so that papered over some of the clunkiness I might have noticed otherwise. Also, Barbara Steele has the screen presence to carry it to the finish line.

The organ-heavy score will either pull you in or annoy you—I dug it.

The red and yellow flag of the new US flag waves over the stadium—a fist over the stripes. Deacon stands at the podium, dressed in his white priest uniform, with silver fists adorning the drape around his neck. He announces the commencement of the 20th annual Transcontinental Road Race, where five racers will cross the country, creating mayhem and violence as they kill as many people as they can along the way to score points.

We meet the racers, all with their own themes and a co-pilot to assist with navigation. Calamity Jane (Mary Woronov) is a cowgirl. Matilda the Hun is a neo-Nazi. Nero the Hero is a gladiator. Machine Gun Joe (Sylvester Stallone) is a gangster. And Frankenstein is, well, a Frankenstein from various limbs lost and transplanted in previous races. Before the race starts, Mr. President addresses the people from his Summer home.

Once the race starts, everything appears to be going smoothly. But elsewhere, a resistance group makes plans to abduct Frankenstein hostage, planting an insider as Frankenstein's new navigator—all his previous navigators are dead. The leader of the resistance wants a peaceful approach, but her team has more violent sabotage in mind.

In classic Roger Corman form, he saw how folks were responding to <i>Rollerball</i> and developed another ""dystopian near future sport/opiate for the masses with deadly consequences"" movie. I didn't write a review of <i>Rollerball</i>, so I can't remember my exact feelings around it, but I recall feeling like it was overwrought and self-serious in a way that I found dull. That said, its politics, while not incisive, were considered. Here, Corman and Co. are satisfied with a ""government bad, rebellion good"" theme to drive a more entertaining and cartoonish approach.

In other words, it's exploitation, baby!

I wasn't a big fan of Paul Bartel's follow-up, <i>Cannonball</i>, which now seems to be an ouroboros of trying to capitalize on the success of Death Race 2000 with more <i>Wacky Races</i>-adjacent hijinks. That said, Bartel has never been silent about how much Corman removed Bartel's injected humor from the movie for more ultraviolence.

To get a sense of the movie's silliness, there's a moment where Calamity Jane, driving her bull-themed car, tries to hit a bullfighter, and the bullfighter keeps taunting her with a cape as though she were a bull. Also, one of the announcers is named Mrs. Pander. A guy curses by saying, ""Jesus Chrystler.""

Arindam Mukherji combs his hair and packs his bag. He's receiving a prestigious award, and he was initially planning not to attend the award ceremony, but he changed his mind. Not because he cares about the prize, mind you — he just wants to escape his problems for a day. Because he decided to go at the last minute, he couldn't arrange for a plane. So, he will take an overnight train to Delhi. Arindam is a popular matinee idol in Bengal, whose name alone used to make movies successful. But times have changed. It also doesn't help that the newspapers say he got in a brawl at a club. It seems that Aridam has given up on the public, studios, and people in general.

Once we arrive on the train, several passengers' stories play out in tandem, all intersecting with Arindam in some way throughout. He encounters admirers, admonishers, and people with myriad agendas. Arindam's desire to escape people may be in vain. Among them is Aditi Sengupta, who is an editor and one of three who work on a small magazine written by women. She approaches Arindam under the guise of getting an autograph, but cannot help but blurt her negative view of celebrity culture and the shallow movies they produce.

After talking with some passengers, Aditi reluctantly approaches him for an interview for her magazine. Their assumptions about one another create a difficult start, but through their reflections, they find themselves opening up to each other and learning just how little their assumptions truly capture.

<blockquote><i>…people like me shouldn't talk too much. We're creatures of light and shadow. It's best not to expose these bodies of flesh and blood too clearly to the public eye.</i></blockquote>

In some ways, this film is a shift away from the parallel cinema that Sanjit Ray had helped develop. While it still maintains Ray's naturalism and artistic interests, it does not focus quite as heavily on the social issues of his <i>Apu Trilogy</i> and similar works. That's not to say he doesn't explore social issues, but rather that he does so through side characters and flashbacks. Though Ray had become an arthouse darling, he desired to make films that reached a wider audience.

Here, he focuses on a character of higher social status who appears to be only concerned with surface-level issues. However, the film is not content to stop there and drives us deeper, arriving at a complexity that one can only consider human. Though we have the magazine editor who interviews him, we still learn more from what isn't said between them. These considerations are also Ray's, as his screenplay explores the role of Indian cinema in the global film world—how much does he draw from American and Italian influences, and what aspects of his films convey Indian tradition and culture?

Although this was Uttam Kumar's first collaboration with Sanjit Ray, Kumar had already appeared in over 100 movies, becoming an idol not dissimilar from his character in this movie. But the film is not a portrait, though it does consider on a meta-level the role of an actor in a movie—is Kumar a puppet for Ray's screenplay, or is he bringing something greater? It's hardly a question as Kumar's performance is stunning in the many nuances of expression he brings to each line—nuances that no director can map out, not even the meticulous Ray.

Sharmila Tagore brings a similar degree of layering and complexity. Both are people who present themselves one way to the public, perhaps in the name of selfishness, but are aware of their inner selves and contain conflicting considerations within them. She also unveils the film's most significant flaw—that is, Ray's lack of consideration for women's experiences in any public-facing occupation. I'm not saying the film is openly misogynist—just that, for a movie with so many depths, it feels slight when it comes to how women must move through the world.

Subrata Mitra's cinematography is fluid and natural, shifting seamlessly from one composition to another in elegant flourishes. The transitions are gorgeous, almost surreal. Among the many ways that this film influenced Wes Anderson, one of the most notable is the way Mitra shifts through dialogue. These influences are most prominent in <i>The Darjeeling Limited</i>, train and all, though Mitra does not invest in flat images in the same way Anderson does.

The power of this movie is its lack of easy answers. For all the considerations mentioned, you won't come away with any answers, only more questions to take with you into your future film experiences. While I find this easier to parse than <i>Pather Panchali</i>, I won't pretend to understand much of its cultural considerations.","criterion channel, criterion, asiancinemachallenge2023, asiancc2023, asiancc2023week9, ibn 100",2025-06-11

It's summer break for most kids, except for those languishing in summer make-up courses. In a math class, a group of girls sit in the back, doing their makeup and nails. The school brass band packs up in a bus to play at a baseball game. The music teacher, Yayoi Itami, not-so-secretly wishes their team would lose so she can head to Hawaii with some friends. Tomoko, a math student, notices that the bus leaves before the van with their lunches arrives. She and the other girls persuade their math teacher, Mr. Ozawa, to let them deliver the lunches.

On the train, Tomoko sneaks one of the bento boxes, and the other girls join in. Soon, they fall asleep and miss their stop. So, they get off at the next one and walk to the game, complaining the whole way. Meanwhile, at the baseball game, Takuo is hungry and exhausted, dropping his cymbals. By the time the girls arrive, the heat has spoiled the meals. And with one missing, Takuo must grab something from the stadium concessions. Lucky him because everyone else in the band and Itami became sick and are hospitalized.

Takuo was planning on quitting the band, but being the only member left, he holds an audition for replacements. A shy girl named Kaori shows up, who can play the recorder—additionally, two punk girls with their electric guitar and bass. Desperate, Takuo confronts the girls who delivered the lunches to persuade them to join the band. He knows they ate one of the lunches and were fine, so the lunches going bad was their fault. So, the girls receive school instruments, but they have no experience or motivation (except for Kaori). Also, there are only 17 of them, unable to fill out the full 42-member brass band.

In a moment of panic, Takuo decides to convert them into a big band jazz orchestra. Are these girls hopeless, or can they pull it together and help lead the baseball team to victory?

I chose to watch this movie because I needed some joy in my life, and I had heard nothing but positive things about it. And it was such a delight! Its playful comedic energy feels effortless, and the performances are just broad enough to transcend any cultural borders. The cinematography features numerous comedic compositions that never feel showy or forced. And watching the girls fall in love with making music just makes my heart swell.

In addition to the school experience, we also spend time with Tomoko's family, seeing how her lack of motivation extends to helping her family around the house. When she finally gets motivated to learn tenor sax, her mom doesn't believe her, pointing to all the things she abandoned. Tomoko's sister, Aki, playing Space Channel 5, gave me a wave of mid-00s nostalgia! The fashion, too!

Don't let the premise fool you — the movie goes to so many places and explores so many set pieces. The boar scene is so creative and fun! I giggled when they discovered all the things in the world that swing. The actors all learned their instruments for the movie, preparing months in advance! So we watch them perform live with no dubs, and it's so satisfying!

Many movies attempt to portray misfit kids being reformed through [insert school activity]. This movie transcends the tropes and finds a refreshing way to tell its story. No movie has gotten more jokes out of ""Take the 'A' Train."" You'll see some dumb as fuck film bros say this ""isn't cinema."" Just because it doesn't make you want to kill yourself doesn't mean it isn't art (apologies for the triple negative).

My heart is so full!

Monochrome mages of Manila's Chinatown reveal the meager conditions of city life. Zooming in, standing below a sign that reads, ""Do you have a problem?"" is Julio Madiaga, a young man from Mariduque who has been in Manila for seven months. The saturation increases, and the image becomes colored. Julio stares at Chua Tek Trading Company and flashes an image of Ligaya waving at him. Ligaya, the woman he loves, left for Manila a while ago with Mrs. Cruz, a woman who came into town looking for women to work in the factory. Julio planned to stay and wait for her, but when she didn't return, he went looking for her.

Julio arrives at a construction site looking for work. Although he earned more at his last construction job, he has no better prospects and must accept it. While working, Julio faints from hunger. Atong helps him up, and coworkers crowd around. Atong grabs Julio a little something from his lunch while another worker tells them to watch out for the foreman. On break, Julio talks about his former life as a fisherman and how life was hard at home. Atong assures him that, without money, life in the city is difficult. Once paid, a couple of workers chip in a little extra for Julio—nothing life-changing, but enough to buy a cigarette or two.

One day, on the job site, construction material falls from several floors up onto a coworker, killing him. This coworker had come to the city in hopes of becoming a singer, practicing on the job site to the annoyance of his coworkers. But no one would have wished this. The foreman chastises the other workers for stopping. Atong also hurt his foot, and Julio helps him home to the shantytown where Atong's family squats. At night, men approach Julio, asking if he wants to pay for young sex workers. Then, Julio thinks he sees Mrs. Cruz.

The film follows Julio as he tries to get by and find Ligaya in the city that always feels like it's on the verge of dawn.

The film was made in the streets of Manila at the height of the Marcos regime, reflecting the horrific social conditions that Lino Brocka saw in life, but which were not reflected in movies. Like many countries that have gone through such times, their films are often escapist fantasies. Marcos gained power, in part, through a major studio biopic that depicted him as a brilliant lawyer and politician. It didn't hurt that the USA also supported Marcos. The regime heavily censored any films with overt political content. So, when Brocka returned to making films, he had to be careful about how he told his stories.

As a seasoned director of ""soaps,"" as he called them, he employed the language of melodrama to tell the story of working-class woes and social inequity. At the construction site, each of them receives a different pay, and some of them must ""buy"" their wages by taking deductions to ensure payment. On paper, they make more than they are paid so that the boss can take a little for himself, not unlike Marcos.

Lest this sound like a total downer, the film has a promising undercurrent in the relationships that Julio forges during his time in Manila. It is a hope that many still cling to as we work for the change we wish to see—the gift of solidarity. Though we are beaten and downtrodden, we are many, and those who exploit us are few. It doesn't change the horrible conditions, and it doesn't save us from pain and misery, but it is a small balm in a beleaguered world. Whether that is enough for Julio is up to the viewer to discover.

The sound design is fascinating in how it balances score and effects. At times, the grinding sounds of rock smashed into gravel drown out the introspective soundtrack, and the voice is barely comprehensible. Or the din of the city colliding with a racing organ. Hope is small, but it is not absent.

The flashbacks bleed into the film, overtaking Julio's vision as though he can think of nothing else. Sometimes, the images flicker between the present and the past, as though holding onto something that is fading.

What helps this film stand out is its portrayal of sex work and how gender influences one's experience within it. The film does not shy away from the queerness intrinsic to male-presenting sex workers despite many not being queer themselves. Movies like Midnight Cowboy could only hint at what this film is unafraid to tell.

This film is one of the most sharply realized political allegories I've seen, beautifully balancing its bleak tone with a humanity that many Western filmmakers would be too scared to include, lest it ""soften"" the tone. It doesn't — it only reflects the complexity of the human condition.","criterion channel, criterion, asiancinemachallenge2023, asiancc2023, asiancc2023week10, queer, solidarity, 1001 movies",2025-06-14

<blockquote><i>They're just children!</i></blockquote>

Jenny is a schoolteacher who works with children in the 4- to 6-year-old age range, but I'm not sure. She's pretty good at giving them structure, and the kids are generally obedient. The week ends, and Jenny meets up with her partner, Steve, who is planning to propose to her on their weekend getaway to Eden Lake. The lake was once a quarry, and developers plan to build a gated community over it, so this weekend is one of the last times to see it in its idyllic beauty. During their car ride, they stop at a traffic light. When it turns green, a group of kids speed by on their bikes, narrowly missing Steve's SUV.

Jenny and Steve have some encounters with the locals that aren't to their liking—loud kids, a stolen parking space, an inattentive barkeep—so the two bond as they mimic Essex accents. When they finally arrive at Eden Lake, the place is surrounded by a high gate and chained doors. They find an opening where the developers haven't finished building the gate and drive in. At the lake, some other teens show up, put on some music, and bring their dog. You know, stuff folks do at the park. Steve tells the kids to turn their music down and watch their dog. The teens ask him to fuck off. Jenny proposes moving, but Steve has something to prove.

The kids leave, and Steve sets up a tent. As night falls, Jenny spots something in the woods, but Steve assures her it's nothing. The following day, they find their tire blown—a prank from the kids. Steve tries to chase them down, but Jenny gets him to give it up so they can grab breakfast. Steve spots the kids' bikes outside a house. So, he ENTERS THE HOME looking for the kids. The owner comes home from work, and Steve must hide, so he GOES UPSTAIRS, barely escaping through the window and hurting his foot in the process. They get back to the beach, where Steve sets up his proposal, but Jenny discovers their beach bag with the car keys is missing. The car is missing.

How will Steve and Jenny handle this? Not well!

We get a sense of the film's conservative leanings early on. While Jenny sleeps in the car, Steve listens to a radio piece about anti-social behavior in youth, citing Tony Blair's Respect agenda from 2005, which was Blair's method of bringing ""a proper sense of respect to schools, communities, towns, and villages."" This proposal included pushing Anti-Social Behavior Orders, a favorite of Blair that harkens back to his first term, which heavily policed behavior on the streets. The idea was ""law and order,"" and the result was targeting less-well-to-do people and people with developmental disabilities. It also had orders to get parents to sign contracts, which forced them to attend parenting classes—more on this point in the SPOILER ZONE below.

Where does the film land on it? In true hixploitation style, Steve is an asshole to locals and complains about it. But because we need a reason to hate the locals, or at the very least be on Steve and Jenny's side, they escalate the situation so that Steve is justified in violence, and so on.

As far as the movie itself goes, it's fine. It's a formula that was worn thin by the time this came out. It attempts to mirror the New French Extremity but aims to be more overtly ""about something."" The gore is visceral and stomach-churning, framed mostly through torture. So much of the movie is ""someone gets hurt, runs, kids spot blood, person hides."" 

<blockquote><i>We look out for our own around here.</i></blockquote>


<b>*** SPOILER ZONE ***</b>
The movie isn't just about homicidal teens. It's about the parents who enable them. Just when Jenny thinks she has survived, she finds herself in the home of the kids and has to fight them. The parents are mirrors of their children. That is where the class issues lie — that if working-class people raised their kids properly, none of this would have happened.

Let me be clear: I have several friends who work in schools, including some who work with teenagers. They can confirm what the internet has been telling us for years: the kids are not alright. COVID quarantine took away some crucial socialization years, and already mediocre parents further exacerbated this problem by appeasing their children with devices. Kids reach high school unable to read, unable to focus without a device in their hands, and unable to handle the dopamine withdrawal required to sit in class and learn. Yes, better parenting is part of it. But being a police state about it demonstrably doesn't work.

<blockquote><i>During the powerful Tokugawa regime in Edo (present-day Tokyo), there were 264 lords or daimyo. These feudal lords ruled their clans and the people under them. This story took place in one of these clans in 1725.</i></blockquote>Far above, we see the peaking roof of the Aizu Clan Domain — intricate and harmonious. The sword of Isaburo blurs in and out of focus as the focus shifts to Isaburo standing behind it, considering his move. His rival Tatewaki watches as he deftly makes one cut through the straw figure, proving the mettle of the sword of his daimyo, Masakata Matsudaira. As Isaburo and Tatewaki walk, Isaburo laments his loveless marriage of twenty years to Suga and voices his longing for his elder son, Yogoro, to meet someone who will be strong and loving.

Back home, a steward of the daimyo awaits Isaburo. The daimyo had dismissed Lady Ichi, his concubine, from the castle for attacking the daimyo when she caught him with another woman. They decree that Yogoro will marry Lady Ichi. The steward will return for an answer. Suga worries that the daimyo dismissed Lady Ichi when Ichi bore him a son. Their younger son, Bunzo, knows they cannot disobey a daimyo's order. The circumstances are not too different from Isaburo and Suga's marriage, and he worries that, despite the promise of a larger fief, the marriage will bring further unhappiness to his family.

So, when the steward returns for an answer, Isaburo declines, stating that his family is unworthy of such an honor. But the steward reminds him that to decline is to defy an order. Yogoro intervenes and states that he wishes to accept the honor. The two marry, and Ichi takes on the domestic duties—the two fall in love. Isaburo seeks retirement, asking that Yogoro take his place. Isaburo tries to get Ichi to stop tolerating Suga's belittling, but Ichi will treat her as a mother. Her demeanor raises questions about how she could have attacked the daimyo.

The film follows the family as they learn the truth. When the daimyo's heir dies, Ichi's son becomes the heir, meaning the daimyo will demand Ichi's return. Will the family give up their happiness and honor the daimyo's wishes?

<i>Samurai Rebellion</i> has a bit of a misleading title. Yes, there are samurai who rebel. However, the film is based on a story whose title loosely translates to ""Receive the Wife"" and focuses on the woman who would become the samurai's wife. That isn't to say it isn't a samurai picture — this is, after all, the same director who gave Letterboxd one of their favorite films, <i>Harakiri</i>. But the film reminds us that there is more to life than martial arts.

Though the film uses Isaburo as our entry point to the story, it is Yōko Tsukasa's Ichi who becomes the film's true protagonist. Her story is more detailed, and her performance is the most dynamic and nuanced of all. She brings the subtleties from her work on Ozu films, and the movie comes to life. It's a bit of an irony that she would only stay active for a few more years before slowing down to care for a family. I don't have to tell you that Mifune is great as well.

Like <i>Harakiri</i>, the film employs compositions to position its characters and convey their condition beyond the exchange of words. These characters are trapped in their circumstances, conveyed through high castle walls. When characters are in harmony, they are equidistant from one another—when there is strife, asymmetry distorts. Also, like <i>Harakiri</i>, the film is steeped in the aesthetics of traditional Japanese art.

Where this film differs is in its intensity of aesthetic considerations, taking the lessons learned and applying them to a new widescreen format. The compositions are considered and meticulous. Also, the characterization is more complex—we deal with some ""villains"" whose motivations we understand but still root against.

Director Masaki Kobayashi once said that all of his films are studies ""of the individual against society."" Here, we fall into that system, fighting against something entirely artificial and yet bigger than any one person can face. This line of inquiry is where the film has its most significant relevance, as we see countries like the USA succumb to populist rhetoric, further isolating individuals from the means of organizing and a sense of community. Perhaps this film can show the viewer that, even when you follow all the rules, the system can turn on you at any moment.

In the end, I prefer this one a bit more to <i>Harakiri</i>, if only because I find its concern with domestic affairs more moving and its aesthetic achievements richer and compelling.","criterion channel, criterion, asiancinemachallenge2023, asiancc2023, asiancc2023week11, solidarity, samurai",2025-06-18
2025-06-20,Moonstruck,1987,https://boxd.it/a3A4gV,5,Yes,"Loretta believes she's unlucky in love, especially since her husband died seven years ago. Maybe it was because they got married in a courthouse. She lives at home with her parents, her grandfather, and their five dogs. Her father thinks she shouldn't get married again because she's bad luck.

Her boyfriend, Johnny, proposes — no kneeling, no ring, but she sets him straight and accepts the proposal. Johnny's mother is sick, but they'll get married when she dies. Before he leaves, he asks Loretta to invite his little brother, Ronny, to the wedding after five years of bad blood.

Johnny took Ronny's life from him. Or rather, Ronny's bride left him when he maimed his hand in the bread slicer, and he hasn't been happy since. He doesn't believe in luck, but both feel they lost their one chance at happiness. But they awaken something in each other that reminds them love is possible.
<blockquote><i>— A bride without a head!
— A wolf without a foot!</i></blockquote>As the film progresses, we see something awakening in several characters. Perhaps the moon has more of an effect than they realize.

The film borrows aspects of the opera that Ronny and Loretta see, La bohème, which offers a series of vignettes of the lives of Bohemians in 1840s Paris — a stoked fire, a cold night, and the discovery of love. Like love in this movie, La bohème has a tragic trajectory, but that first spark of love is sudden and intense.

The magic of the movie is time, measured by the moon. The moon shines a brilliant light at its fullest, allowing the characters to see the life they've built. It tells them that love isn't a rational choice but a wildness—a death drive sending them careening into utter misery and unspeakable happiness. The people who seem happy in love are those who don't forget the early spark and youthful desire that drew them together in the first place.

A toy tank and an overturned Coke bottle transition to a full-sized tank. People run, hiding their kids, as the tank crushes cars. A kid in a cowboy hat follows the massive tank tracks and finds his toy tank. He brings it to three other children, one of whom is glowing.

A group of kids play in a park, celebrating K.T.'s birthday. Her father, Ben, and his girlfriend, Nicky, call the kids over for birthday cake. Later, K.T. catches Ben and Nicky making out by the river. The rain picks up, lightning filling the sky, so they hit the road to continue their road trip through the California desert. The rain clears. As they come around a bend, the radio turns to static on all stations. Ben sees tire tracks spilling over the edge of the road, finding a car that the tank demolished, along with the remnants of human remains peeking out.

Ben races into the nearest town to report what he's seen. The streets of Hillsboro seem mostly empty, with people observing from their windows. Ben knocks on the sheriff's door. The sheriff drives up and holds Ben at gunpoint, asking Ben basic questions about his occupation. The townspeople pour out of their homes to celebrate, but another man chases Ben with an axe. Ben and his family climb back into the car and race away. While driving away from the town, a little girl appears out of nowhere in the middle of the road. Ben swerves to miss her and crashes his car into a telephone pole. When they get out, they don't see the girl. K.T. is convinced they killed her. With no other options, they walk back to Hillsboro on foot.

What's going on with the kids in Hillsboro? Who is this girl who appears and disappears at will?

The movie answers this question pretty quickly, but I'll leave it for the viewer to learn, as those answers are probably the best part of the movie.

The movie acknowledges that it lacks the budget to execute the kills in the story, so much of it occurs just out of frame or with carefully composed edits to suggest what it can't show. I could also see this being a deliberate choice to make the horror feel more ""elevated"" and not exploitative.

In that same vein, the film has a more deliberate pace, bordering on slow. When we first see Ben, Nicky, and K.T. driving, the scene is silent for almost five minutes apart from the music. It eventually works as they notice the radio cutting out, but we could use a bit more in the scene to warrant the time. 

The makeup for the coven was probably more appropriate when the movie was of lower fidelity. However, with the remaster, it mostly appears as though the filmmakers were attempting to make the older characters look even older and more haggard.

The film explores witchcraft and psychic powers as tools of the devil. I don't know if it has any thematic considerations in mind—the lack of coherence in many facets of the story suggests this. The screenwriter has stated outright that he chose the subjects only because they were popular at the time. 

That said, the horror moments are pretty fun. The way the movie uses children is familiar in some places but fairly unnerving in others. The coven sets are pretty great. For all my complaints, the film makes some aesthetic choices that I quite like. The dream sequence, in particular, is quite outrageous.


<b>*** SPOILER ZONE ***</b>
The film has some nods to <i>Rosemary's Baby</i> and <i>Village of the Damned</i>, but I think the best comparison is <i>Get Out</i>, but instead of black people it's children. To orphan the children, their toys come to life and kill their families. Then, the entranced children go with the other entranced children to the coven.

I like that the doctor messes up his hair and puts on glasses to disguise himself, but no one outside of the coven knows he's the leader, so what's the point? It's like Superman only dressed as Clark Kent on Mars.

<blockquote><i>The worst of the Eight Hells is called ""Continuous Hell."" It has the meaning of Continuous Suffering. Thus, the name.</i> — Nirvana Sutra</blockquote>

At a Buddhist temple, triad boss Hon Sam gives a speech to a group of young members with clean criminal records about how he started the gang and how the police killed six of his brothers while sparing his life. He sends this group to become undercover agents in the Hong Kong Police Force. They join the police training school and work their way up through the ranks. Among them is Lau Kin-ming. Lau rises through the ranks through promotion after promotion, becoming a Senior Inspector.

Meanwhile, a cadet named Chan Wing-yan receives a special briefing in which Superintendent Wong expels him from the training school. But what only he, Senior Inspector Cheung and the superintendent know is that Yan has become an undercover cop who will infiltrate Hon Sam's gang. Over the years, Yan faces hardships as both police and gangsters beat him while he performs morally questionable actions in the name of keeping his cover.

After ten years of working undercover, Cheung dies. Wong is looking for a path to reintegrate Yan, but the numerous assaults on his criminal record are making it complicated. Still, Yan informs Wong of a drug trade between Hong San and Thai coke dealers. Lau gets some intel by impersonating a triad member's lawyer, but intentionally keeps the guy from revealing too much. Still, the police can stop the drug deal.

Through the exchange of information during the sting, both Wong and Hon Sam realize they have spies in their organizations. Will Lau or Yan be able to escape discovery and find a place of safety?

The film explores the psychological effects of being someone you're not for a prolonged period, drawing influence from <i>Face/Off</i> but aiming to make it more grounded in reality. Our two leads have crises of identity as their choices as kids force them to live the opposite lives they intended. For Yan, he cannot find that cop inside him. For Lau, he discovers that he's pretty good at being a cop and might prefer that life to one as a triad.

The Chinese title translates to ""Unceasing Path,"" but could be more accurately translated as ""Road of Eternal Pain."" The eternal pain these characters face is having no freedom to make choices for themselves—those who know their identity hold them in place.

We see this come through throughout the movie. One way is Lau's wife, who is writing a novel about a man with multiple identities who wakes up and plays a different role each day, forgetting which one is the ""real"" him. Yan asks his psychiatrist if she thinks he's a good guy or a bad guy, because she lets him nap during each session and doesn't know. So, like, it isn't subtle.

Where the movie has more to offer thematically is in how the characters' identity crises reflect the experiences of the Hong Kong people. From 1841 to 1997, they were a British colony. Then, in 1997, the British handed over HK to Mainland China. In both cases, the HK people's identity is not their own. Director Andrew Lau grew up hating HK, believing in his heart that he is Chinese—this has led to him directing propaganda for the People's Republic of China and focusing his content on a Mainland China audience.

Tony Leung and Andy Lau are both powerhouse actors, giving stellar action performances here. You won't see Leung give the subtlety he gives Wong Kar-wai or what Lau does for directors like Ann Hui, but this movie doesn't demand it. I also really like Anthony Wong in this—I have a backlog of horror movies he's been in that I'm looking forward to.

Overall, I think much of the movie's thematic richness comes from discussing it more than the experience of watching it. Still, I enjoyed the intrigue and watching this cast psyche each other out. Though Scorsese won his only Oscar for remaking this as <i>The Departed</i>, I believe this is the superior film.","criterion channel, criterion, golden horse, cops, gangs, asiancinemachallenge2023, asiancc2023, asiancc2023week12",2025-06-22

Jim Hasley can barely keep his eyes open as he crosses West Texas deserts at dusk. He's transporting a drive-away from Chicago to San Diego. He chugs his coffee and turns on the radio. A storm breaks, and lightning strikes. Still, he drifts away, nearly colliding with a truck, but manages to awaken and regain control of the car. On the side of the road, he sees a hitchhiker and stops for him, joking that his mother tells him not to do this. Jim asks the man where he's going, but the man evades the question with other questions or observations.

Down the way, Jim sees a car stranded on the side of the road. Jim intends to stop, but the man pushes Jim's leg down on the accelerator, forcing him to speed past. Jim finally stops the car and demands that the man leave, but the man refuses. The man coaxes him to continue and finally reveals that he is responsible for the stranded car—the man dismembered the driver, and he's going to do the same to Jim. What does the man want? He wants Jim to stop him. Jim pushes the guy out of the car and escapes.

Later down the road, a station wagon with a mother, father, and daughter pulls in front of Jim. He sees that the man is in the back with the daughter. Jim tries to signal them to get the guy out, but a bus comes and knocks Jim off the road. He recovers and drives further, seeing the station wagon pulled over on the side of the road. Jim looks in the car. We don't know what he sees, but we know there is blood everywhere. For some reason, Jim stops at a gas station to make a call. And there, waiting for him, is the hitchhiker.

The movie follows Jim as this dude keeps chasing him. Is this real life, or did Jim fall asleep at the wheel? Is Jim's life in danger, or is this hell?

I ask those questions because the hitchhiker is basically magic, appearing and disappearing at plot-convenient times. The world seems to morph around Jim so that he is the only logical person who could be committing these murders. So, perhaps the hitchhiker is Jim.

Well, the movie very quickly dispels this notion, so…

Buffy and Star Trek fans will be happy to see Armin Shimerman, however briefly. Frank Darabont stans will appreciate Jeffrey DeMunn's scenes.

Rutger Hauer is stellar as the hitchhiker. He didn't need to go this hard, and he did. C. Thomas Howell, of <i>Soul Man</i> fame, is fine. The movie gets a little more interesting when Jennifer Jason Leigh shows up as Nash. Her Texas accent sucks, but I don't care.

The film boasts numerous visual spectacles, particularly for those who enjoy car stunts and chases. The cinematography and lighting are quite outstanding in places, effectively conveying moods that the movie otherwise struggles to articulate.

I'm open to more surreal interpretations of this film. I'm also open to the possibility that this may not be a very good movie. From what I've read, it would be easy to blame studio execs, who chopped this movie to bits to avoid making a straight horror movie.

It's a bit gay, though!","oh my horror, omh, omh2025, carsploitation, serial killer, slasher",2025-06-24

<b>Republic of China, 1920s</b>

Songlian is a nineteen-year-old university student. After six months, however, her father dies, and the family can no longer afford it. For three days, Songlian's stepmother begs her to get married. Nineteen-year-old Songlian relents sorrowfully, agreeing to marry someone rich, even though she would only be a rich man's concubine. Summer arrives, and Songlian packs her bag and walks to the Chen family compound, where she becomes the Fourth Mistress. While Chen Baishun, the housekeeper, prepares the house, Songlian tries to help Yan'er, her maid, with washing, but Yan'er forcefully stops Songlian when she realizes Songlian is the Fourth Mistress.

Songlian finds her room filled with red lanterns to celebrate her arrival. The servants prepare a footbath and massage Songlian's feet. They decorate her hair. Evening falls, and Master Chen arrives in Songlian's room to visit with her. He asks her to undress and get in bed, where he lies with her into the night, the red lanterns glowing. A servant comes to the door, saying the Third Mistress is ill and needs his attention. He tells her it can wait until morning, but she doesn't relent. So, Master Chen goes to visit her, and the servants set up lanterns in the third house. It's only later that Songlian learns that the Third Mistress, Meishan, wasn't sick but merely demanding Master Chen's attention, afraid of no longer being the youngest and most beautiful of the mistresses.

The following day, Chen Baishun requests that Songlian visit with the other three mistresses before breakfast as is the house custom. Each of the four mistresses has their own wing of the compound, and she must visit them individually. The First Mistress is surprisingly old and somewhat resigned. The Second Mistress, Zhongyun, is cheerful and warm. She tells Songlian how the mistress chosen for the night receives the foot massage and lighted lanterns and suggests that Songlian, being so young, may receive many nights like this. This favor also extends to choosing what meals she has — a necessity as a vegetarian that is never guaranteed.

The film follows Songlian through the seasons and the daily life of the house as she tries to adapt to the endless family customs and thinly veiled cruelty of her new life.

<blockquote><i>— Good or bad, it's all playacting. If you play well, you fool the others. If you play poorly, you can only fool yourself. If you can't even fool yourself, you can fool the ghosts.
—People breathe; ghosts cannot. That's the only difference. People are ghosts, and ghosts are people.</i></blockquote>

The Chinese title, 大紅燈籠高高掛 (literally meaning ""big red lanterns hung high""), refers to a decorative practice in traditional China for celebrations, such as Chinese New Year. It also functions as an idiom for superficial happiness, which I'm realizing, as I write this, may stem from this movie.

The cinematography is wall-to-wall stunning. From the opening shot, centering on Gong Li as she relents in tears before her mother, my eyes were locked on the screen. The visual of the red lanterns creates a powerful motif, offsetting the brown tones of the Chen house with red-orange cylinders that seem to float in the space. The Quao Family Compound, which they filled as the Chen family compound, is gorgeous.

One of my favorite choices the movie makes is never giving us a clear view of Master Chen — we can assume he is older based on the age of the First Mistress, but we learn little of his physical appearance. We do, however, discover his true character as the film progresses. Early on, for example, Songlian catches him fooling around with Yan'er. But as we learn of his family's history with women, we see this is a very minor transgression.

The score is killer! Zhao Jiping creates a soundspace that feels traditional and contemporary, blending traditional instrumentation with early 90s production techniques. The textures are lush but disorienting, as though arriving in the middle of someone else's party. I can see why director Zhang Yimou collaborates with him so extensively.

The sound effects are also rich with nuances. I love the sound of the pipes as they blow out the lanterns.

Gong Li's performance as Songlian is remarkable. The camera often lingers on her face, allowing us to see the complex shifting of emotions. Songlian, like the other mistresses, are victims with little control over their lives. The house breeds cruelty in some desperate attempt at control in a world ultimately left to the whims of one man.

I'm happy that we get to hear He Saifei sing, as she is a famous Yue opera performer in real life. There's a scene where she sings directly to the camera, and I love it.

My biggest complaint about the movie is how emotionally distant we stay from the characters. Even as we experience our lead's mourning and pain, we have limited access to it, as the film prioritizes the visual experience. Also, the servant gossip, while believable, makes too literal and blunt what the film has already suggested.

I would like to know more about why China banned the film for three years and later released it. I know that China later banned Zhang Yimou and Gong Li for <i>To Live</i>, and Yimou made a bunch of crowd-pleasers to try and regain favor. If anyone has any resources on this topic, please let me know.","torrent, asiancinemachallenge2023, asiancc2023, asiancc2023week13, solidarity, 1001 movies, chinese dissident cinema, golden horse, village voice, fifth generation chinese",2025-06-26
2025-06-28,Blood for Dracula,1974,https://boxd.it/a8Z6CT,3,,"<b><a href=""https://boxd.it/q9zuy/detail"">Cult Movie Challenge 2018 | 2/52 | Gothic Horror</a></b>

<b>1920s</b>

<blockquote><i>The blood of these whores is killing me!</i></blockquote>

Count Dracula applies blood red to his cheeks and lips, as well as black hair coloring to his pale white hair, all to hide his sickness. Anton, his manservant, encourages him to leave Romania and travel to where he can find more virgin blood to drink. Anton believes that because the Catholic church requires virgins for their marriages, Italy will be the ideal place to find them. So, the Count reluctantly abandons his family and ancestral home. They strap his coffin and wheelchair onto the car's roof and hit the road.

Meanwhile, the Di Fiore family lives on their declining Italian estate, reminiscing about a time when their gardens were in full bloom. The four daughters tend to the grounds but live decent lives. Saphiria and Rubinia strip off their top as they till the garden, seeing themselves as workers and peasants. The estate handyman, Mario, regularly hooks up with them. The Count arrives in Italy, and Anton asks around for families with virgin daughters for the Count to marry. An innkeeper mentions the Di Fiore family.

When the Fiore's get word that the Count is looking to marry, they agree, desperate to bring new money into the family. We follow Dracula as he tries to figure out who is actually a virgin in this family.

The film has an oversaturated, overblown look, making the decent sets and costuming look cheaper than they are. It would be easy to blame a cheap remaster, but being in the Criterion Collection, I don't think they would intentionally do that. As of now, it's only an out-of-print DVD, anyway.

Mario is a Marxist for humor purposes, performing that familiar centrist routine of Fascism and Marxism, both being equal forms of oppression, just with different oppressors in power. The former designs a world of ostensible purity, one which should be safe for a vampire whose survival demands it. The latter is an equal-opportunity rapist, unsatisfied with just two of the daughters and desperate to rape the youngest.

— He's a disgusting person with money. After the revolution, he'll be a disgusting person without money!

The film is meant to be funny, but I don't find it particularly amusing. I think a good chunk of it is just, ""Italians, am I right?"" And then there's the scene where Anton tries to pick up a young girl for Dracula in a bar, and Roman Polanski speaks up. It makes sense he would be involved with a comedy featuring this much rape.

Udo Kier brings a certain sympathy for Dracula, especially after we see him painfully vomiting blood over and over as he accidentally drinks non-virgin blood. If this film had been released a decade later, one could draw parallels with the AIDS crisis. It is amusing that, in a decade where Dracula became a symbol of sexual liberation and repressed desires, the film sticks to Dracula as an old-world mechanism of exploitation.

Let me clarify: I don't think this is a bad movie. It's weird and entertaining in its own fucked up way. But I don't think I am the target audience for this movie's sensibilities. The last ten minutes are a wild gorefest!","tubi, cmc, cmc2018, written by women, edited by women, criterion, vampires, italian gothic",2025-06-27
2025-06-29,Red Rock West,1993,https://boxd.it/a9nfjp,4,,"Ex-Marine Michael drove from Texas to Wyoming because a friend said he could offer him a job in an oilfield. The foreman, however, doesn't want to take on the liability of hiring someone with a bum knee. His friend chastises him for bringing up the knee at all, but Michael refuses to be dishonest. He drives to a nearby gas station to fill up. He looks for the gas station attendant but finds a wad of cash sticking out of a safety deposit box. Michael shakes his head, and the gas station attendant arrives to pump gas. While filling up on Michael's last five dollars, the gas station attendant suggests that Michael head to Red Rock and ask around for work there.

Michael pulls up to a bar in Red Rock. The bartender, Wayne, sees the Texas license plate and assumes Michael is Lyle and is there for the job. Michael, desperate for work, doesn't contradict Wayne and follows him back to the office, where Wayne places $5,000 on the table. Half now, half when he finishes the job. And what is this job? It's to murder Wayne's wife, Suzanne. 

Michael has been honest to a fault up to this point. What will this simple lie cost him for such a generous reward?

The film has that satisfying blend of revisionist Western atmosphere with a textbook noir plotline. Throw some Nic Cage and Dennis Hopper into the mix, and you have a tasty, melodramatic little thriller.

The first act is so tight, putting all the pieces in place and keeping me on the edge of my seat. The script avoids many plot cul-de-sacs by opting for a fun turn of events instead of the most logical one. These choices aren't a problem until the third act, where the movie makes one twist too many and plays out a routine climax.

That said, Nic Cage is in his 90s prime here — yes, he leans more toward <i>The Rock</i> than <i>Face/Off</i>, but he knows exactly what he's doing. No surprise, Dennis Hopper gets to be the one who goes buck-wild, complete with his arsenal of improvised quips and expressive face.

The real weak links are Lara Flynn Boyle and, to a lesser extent, J.T. Walsh. After Boyle's successful run on <i>Twin Peaks</i> and her comedic performance in <i>Wayne's World</i>, it seemed like she could do it all. But here, she lacks the charisma for the role, coming off more like a horny high schooler than a femme fatale. It's only a problem during a brief and hilarious sex scene. The film just asks J.T. Walsh to do too much. They lean on our expectations of who his character would be, and when it's anything more, the movie slows a bit.

Perhaps my score is going a little higher than I would usually because I watched it with an audience who knew when to laugh and cheer—they knew this movie isn't as deadly serious as <i>Blood Simple</i>, and no one can deny the pleasure of Nic Cage yelling.

I'm thrilled to have had the opportunity to see a screening of this at the Carolina Theatre! This movie is notorious for being rarely screened and difficult to find. The latter is likely due to the studio's total lack of faith in John Dahl, as evidenced by their decision to sell TV rights to HBO and Showtime before the movie hit theaters.

The film has a poetic feel reminiscent of Terrence Malick's work, with narration and stories interwoven through picturesque images and family dialogues. The story is loose, focusing on the characters over a day while incorporating aspects from the past and the future. Central to the narrative is Eli and Eula's unborn child, who narrates about her coming and all of the memories she carries with her from her ancestors.

Julie Dash's experience is still common for women filmmakers. She barely got the funding to make this movie.

Wet, buff, and in a towel, Francesco answers a call from Franco. Before he can speak, however, he hears a knock on his door. At the door is an Italian man carrying a briefcase and wearing a suit. Oh, and he's the risen dead. Francesco puts a bullet in the man's skull before returning to his call with Franco. After the call, he carries the body to his assistant Gnaghi, and the two walk into the cemetery to rebury him. Another undead rises, which Francesco calls a Returner, before they can finish. All in a night's work.

Francesco is a caretaker for Buffalora Cemetery, living next to the cemetery for which he cares. This cemetery is unusual in that people buried there often rise from their graves on the seventh night after their death. It wasn't always this way, but Francesco still stops them all the same. With few technical skills, and as the village outcast, he doesn't have much of a choice if he wants to get by.

The film follows Fransceso's journey through love, death, and everything in between. As the living dead problem grows each night, Fransceso might have to reconsider his methods.

<blockquote><i>Nothing happened. Nothing ever happens.</i></blockquote>

I've enjoyed everything else I've seen from Michael Soavi. This movie capitalizes on a sense of humor that his other films have hinted at but never outright stated, ""comedy."" The melodramatic touches are amusing, with the romance between Francesco and the widow he falls in love with.

Sergio Stivaletti and the team's effects are great for 90s Italian horror — it's grotesque without being nauseating, if that makes sense. I'm also really into floating flame balls, or ""ignis fatuus."" The visual style, like Soavi's other movies, has moments of transcendence. The cinematography seems to match whatever genre the film is engaging in at that moment: melodrama, comedy, or abject horror. It's a bit disorienting, especially as the film devolves, but those moments where it works are pretty memorable.

Rupert Everett's Francesco has a tragic appeal reminiscent of Lee Pace in Pushing Daisies. He can't seem to catch a break, and even if you're not in love with the guy, you want something good to happen for him. That his favorite reading is the phone book is an amusing joke, but it pushes believability in a movie about a guy who kills zombies.

The Gnaghi character is… unfortunate.

The 1990s certainly loved their horror comedies! I'm not complaining, but it's hard for them to feel special when they're in such ample supply.

All the while, the score from Mulholland Dr. plays in the background — this won't be the last time the movie uses references to other movies.

Spigga pulls Rachael into an assessment, where she watches a Mommy 6.0 concert. Afterward, a board assesses her response to the performance. At night, she smears her vaginal secretions all over her Mommy body pillow and dolls. She obsesses over the idea of meeting Mommy one day and having Mommy's puffy lips.

Frank says his goodbyes to his staff at Cycle World, his motorcycle dealership. His co-owner, Roger, is at the track racing motobikes. So, Frank takes the RV to the track, along with their wives, Kelly and Alice, to pick Roger up on their way out of San Antonio for their ski vacation in Aspen. Oh, and Roger and Kelly's cute little dog, Ginger.

Roger wants to stop at an RV park for the night, but Frank wants to rough it, as much as one can in an RV. So, they stop in a ravine just beneath a rocky meadow. Frank and Roger go riding while Kelly and Alice go for a walk. Ginger barks, freaking Kelly out — apparently, Ginger never barks.

That night, Frank and Roger sit outside, reminiscing over a bottle of whiskey. Across the way, they see a large fire erupt and several people stand around it in cloaks. Because they're morons, they sneak to get a closer look. They witness robes drop, a guy in a mask, and a woman stabbed in the heart over the fire.

Alice calls for Frank, alerting the ritual participants to the presence of our protagonists. Will they be able to escape? Yeah, they do immediately. So what's the movie about? You'll be able to guess pretty quickly once the police get involved.

The film is a typical example of ""middle-class American values versus counter-culture fears,"" but it doesn't do anything with that idea beyond offering vapid reflections on purchased goods.  Part of the film feels like an advertisement for the RV as Frank goes over every feature, and the vehicle successfully navigates through shallow rivers and other idyllic settings. Of course, when it gets stuck during the chase, that feeling subsides.

The movie pulls a few ""No one saw me do this"" moments — things they could have easily filmed, but instead feel like the screenwriter made them up on the spot to get out of a corner. Even though you understand what's happening way before the characters do, it still doesn't make much sense. Henry Fonda and Warren Oates nearly quit the movie when they switched screenwriters mid-shoot.

It isn't until the last 30 minutes that the movie starts to have any fun with its premise. You could cut the entire second act, and it would do nothing to the story, well, except for a couple of great shots with Kelly looking around at normal people's faces, worried that one of them might secretly be a Satanist.

I wouldn't say the ending saves it, but it emphasizes that this film is about spectacle, not consideration. So, I consider it fine.

<b><i>The Substance</i>, but with substance</b>

<blockquote><i>A word at the start: laughing sounds a lot like screaming.</i></blockquote>A melodramatic score introduces us to Lilico, wrapped head-to-toe in bandages after receiving full-body plastic surgery. Posters and magazine covers everywhere feature her body. But time passes, and what passes for beautiful fades over the years. To the public, she's the ideal of grace and natural beauty. Behind the scenes, she's quite the diva. She cheats on her boyfriend, primarily for career opportunities. It doesn't help that her mother pushes her in all these realms.

One night, while surveying her body in the mirror, she discovers a bruise forming on her forehead, sending her back to the Platina Clinic for an operation. Soon, she'll be starring in her first significant film role, so she can't be out of work for another surgery. So, her mother asks for something quicker.

Little does she know, the clinic where she received her treatment is in trouble for tax evasion, bribing politicians, and drug and baby-part trafficking. The clinic's processes intentionally degrade, requiring the clients to return for consistent touchups. If they run out of money, the clinic leaves them with severe side effects.

What will Lilico lose first — her looks or her mind?

<blockquote><i>We'll be forgotten. We're machines for the processing of desires.</i></blockquote>Director Mika Ninagawa is also a photographer, known for her brightly colored photographs. The film translates that perspective into film, heightening every moment with rich aesthetics that engage with and subvert the beauty industry's idealism. It's a style that works perfectly for the genre-blurring this movie does. Films like <i>Too Beautiful to Die</i> and <i>Nothing Underneath</i> work on a similar wavelength, but not to this extent.

Lilico's behavior is challenging to tolerate — she's pretty cruel, even when she means to be kind. When her less attractive sister enters the picture, Lilico pressures her to get work done. The way she toys with her assistant, Hada, is heartbreaking. 

Sex becomes the only way she knows how to keep people around, even when they don't want it. The film contrasts this with Hada's sex with her boyfriend, which is slow, joyful, and attentive — the type of sex that only comes from years of intimacy and care. Lilico can't force someone to love her.

Of course, the abuse doesn't begin with Lilico, nor her manager, who has crafted Lilico into her image. Bejewelled nails, fake eyelashes, makeup brands marketed to pre-teen girls; magazine covers airbrushed to perfection—all of it sends a simple but pervasive message: how a woman looks is what matters. In the decade or more since this came out, this trend has extended into complex skincare routines and getting Botox before you can legally drink.

I compared this to <i>The Substance</i> because both deal with fighting time to maintain an unrealistic beauty standard. I like <i>The Substance</i>, but it lacks the complex character at the center that this film has.


<b>*** Stray Thoughts ***</b>
* The score is whimsical, at times reminiscent of Danny Elfman's oom-pah style, with several nods to classical music and a bombastic use of Beethoven's Ode to Joy.
* The film also explores that queer ambiguity — do I want you or do I want to be you?
* I'm not gonna lie — I love her apartment.
* The special effects are excellent, making me squirm in several places. 
* The police subplot is a little annoying and obvious — the poetic cop isn't THAT poetic, stating the themes as bluntly and repeatedly as possible. Cutting it entirely would significantly sharpen this movie.","torrent, oh my horror, omh, omh2025, directed by women, written by women, queer, j-horror",2025-07-17

<blockquote><i>We aren't men disguised as wolves. We are wolves disguised as men.</i></blockquote>

In this reality, Nazi Germany wins WWII and occupies the Allies' member Japan. The Era of Economic Growth begins, amplifying the economy through coercive polices that leave many unemployed. Armed anti-government groups create a constant state of social unrest, as the police are ill-equipped to deal with them. The government does not send in the fragile military, nor do they equip the police to become a national force. They form a new force called the Capital Police Organization (CAPO). Armed with advanced equipment and weaponry, the CAPO disperses several guerrilla groups, which then coalesce into a unified group known as The Sect. Instead of lowering violent crimes, the explosive and destructive warring between CAPO and The Sect turns the city into a war zone.

Riots in the street as 3000 civilians throw rocks, bricks, and Molotovs at the Self-Police. Through the back alleys and to the storm sewers below travels Nanami, a courier for The Sect. She delivers a satchel charge to a Sect member near the frontlines of the riot. She heads down to get another delivery when she hears all-too-familiar footsteps of the Kerberos, a sub-group of CAPO armed with exoskeletons and heavy artillery. Kerberos decimates the Sect members. Nanami runs, believing she has escaped, when a Kerberos member named Fuse corners her. He hesitates to shoot her despite the order, giving her time to pull the fuse on her satchel charge, killing her and knocking out power throughout the city.

Fuse survives, but the Self-Police lose control of the situation. As punishment, CAPO demands that Fuse go through training. The film follows Fuse as he grows disillusioned with the organization for which he works and the government that controls it.

Writer Mamoru Oshii was already stretching himself thin with the Ghost in the Shell movie, so he brought the script to a frequent collaborator, Hiroyuki Okiura. The only significant difference that I'm aware of is that, under Okiura's direction, the film was entirely drawn by hand. Oshii would likely have utilized computer animation, as he had in Ghost in the Shell. Still, the film underwent digital scanning to enhance texture and cinematography.

Aesthetically, it's impossible to find much fault — the images are immaculate and the compositions are cinematic and striking. The opening scene in particular hits hard. The story leaves something to be desired. It loosely structures itself around Little Red Riding Hood — the couriers are Riding Hoods, and the Kerberos are the big bad wolves. Similar to Ghost in the Shell, the movie is more drama than action, with many dialogue-heavy scenes.

That said, I much prefer the drama to the action movie I was worried this might be. Thematically, the film explores cultural forgetting — the way seismic shifts alter our collective perception of the world, causing us to lose sight of what once united us. New assumed defaults take their place, and we forget how we once lived and view our world.

<blockquote><i>If a building can disappear in a day, it's like it was never there, just like when people die.</i></blockquote>

The film also explores how oppressive governments create fractured identities. As the government limits, restricts, and defunds more social programs, people start to fight not just from a political identity, but a social and psychological one — it's not just my rights as a political citizen, but as a gendered and sexual person that comes under attack. How many US citizens dream of defecting to a different country, where they can have a new and holistic identity?

Why do people join ICE, MAGA, or the military? Because they see a world of fractured identities and a desire to belong to something more than themselves. These individuals are often undereducated and propagandized, such that they cannot conceive of an alternative reality. They are fed stories of surviving bloodlines and the threats posed by outside groups to their survival. That is the ultimate power of oppression: to eliminate the imagination of something other than this is possible.

<blockquote><i>It's not a human being you're betraying.</i></blockquote>

Fuse's journey begins when he sees another possibility. As long as we believe that this shift is possible for individuals, the fight isn't over. Whether this film agrees is left for the viewer to discover.","tubi, cmc, cmc2018, anime, solidarity",2025-07-18

My fear of saying the wrong thing has prevented some minor relationship arguments in the past. It has also contributed to irreparable rifts where I didn't feel I could confide in them. If we argued like this, would we have stayed together? Maybe. Would we be happy? Who knows!

For some people, a relationship only works if they bail when it gets too difficult. I don't blame them, because this is what the other side can look like.

<blockquote><i>In 2018, a documentary team traveled all over Thailand to study the lives of shamans. After interviewing many shamans, the team decided to study the life of Nim, the shaman of 'Goddess Ba Yan.'</i></blockquote>

In the Isan region of Thailand, the locals' belief in spirits pre-dates any religion. By spirits, they mean anything outside the natural. That is, not only the spirits of the dead, but the spirits in houses, forests, mountains, in everything. Some help people, and some haunt them and make them sick.

Nim is a shaman, or medium, who believes Goddess Ba Yan possesses her. Ba Yan is an ancestral spirit who has protected the villages for several generations. It passes through the women in Nim's family. Noi, Nim's elder sister, was to receive Ba Yan but declined to do so. So, it went to Nim instead. Nim didn't want the responsibility of being a shaman, trying to take her own life, but not succeeding. So, she accepted the role and is now glad she did.

Every year, the people host a celebration in which they ask Ba Yan how they will fare in the coming year. The people of the villages come to Nim for help with unnatural illnesses. That is, those stemming from the unseen world, such as black magic or harmful spirits. For every action, good or evil, there is a consequence. When Noi's husband, Wiroj, dies of cancer, we learn the tragic fate of all the men on Wiroj's side of the family. Now, Noi only has her daughter, Mink.

The film follows the family as secrets come to light. Also, Mink demonstrates unusual behavior.

I appreciate how the film delves into aspects of traditional Thai folklore. It doesn't treat it as anything unusual, but lets it emerge through the experience. The worldbuilding is the film's strongest asset.

Narilya Gulmongkolpech, who plays Mink, is also a highlight. As the possessed one, she has to pull some unusual (and unbelievable) scenes, and she makes it work.

The film's primary issue is its reliance on the found footage format. The genre tropes add noise to the experience that the production already achieves. It wouldn't be a problem if the film didn't rely on tropes so heavily for its scares.

Additionally, the movie is excessively long.

Banjong Pisanthanakun has shown his ability to mimic Western horror. See also his movie, <i><a href=""https://boxd.it/4V6qmT"">Shutter</a></i>. If he can learn to eschew the tropes, he might be a formidable director. Still, the film has some haunting moments that kept me invested.

The Tian Nan Tigers arrive at the Dao Tian Estate. They fight through Dao Tian's men and find Du's wife and son, Dao Chang. To punish Du for his arrogance, the Tian Nan Tigers cut off Du's wife's legs and Chang's arms. Du arrives in time to see the horrific act. He kills the Tian Nan fighters with the Tiger Strike. Though his wife is dead, Du has iron hands forged for Chang, training him in the Tiger style.

As an adult, Chang has iron hands that shoot poison darts. They also extend Inspector Gadget-style. Du has captured the sons of the Tian Nan Tigers. He will release them if they can defeat Chang in a fight. He instructs Chang not to kill them, but to cripple them as their father crippled him. Chang wins with no effort, and they go to the local inn to celebrate.

At the inn, Wan beats up two men for laughing at Change. Chen Shuen, a traveling salesman, and the local blacksmith, Wei Jia-Jie, witness this. Wei calls out Du's tyrannical behavior. Chang blinds Chen by gouging out his eyes. They then force Wei to drink a liquid that renders Wei mute. Wei still fights, so Du renders him deaf as well. A man named Hu Ah-kue bumps into Chang. In retaliation, Du's men cut off his legs. A swordsman named Wang Yi, a stranger to those parts, witnesses vandals harassing Hu and Chen. When he sees their state, he goes to avenge them. Though formidable, Du's clan captures and tortures Wang until he is mentally disabled.

Chin, Wei, Hu, and Wang travel to Wang's master in hopes that he can train them to avenge Du. Will these fighters overcome their disabilities and restore peace?

Despite the brutal way in which dudes maim each other, the movie is quite hammy. Part of this is due to the childish way with which the film handles physical and mental disability. Though offensive, it presents an unusual format for the genre. The worst offense is when it compares evil and disability. The film states that evil is an incurable mental disability.

The film employs a fisheye lens for one of its establishing shots. The result creates an unusual distortion. Some of the lenses also have a blur around their edges, giving some shots a diffuse, almost dreamy quality. Also, those signature fast pull-outs are always satisfying.

I wish I enjoyed the fights more! They're great spectacles, but they're such nonsense that I find it hard to connect to. Like many of these movies, the training sequences are the best part. This one features some entertaining acrobatics.

I'm still new to Shaw Brothers movies, so I'm not sure how this one compares to others. I found it enjoyable despite its problematic subject matter.

Are we in the fiery pits of hell? Nar, we enter the mind and blood of an unstoppable killer named Jason Voorhees, held in the Crystal Lake Research Facility by the US Government. They have failed every attempt to kill Jason, so they intend to put him into cryogenic stasis. 

Dr. Aloysius Wimmer arrives at the facility. He hopes to continue research on Jason's regenerative abilities. With his cadre of soldiers, he intends to transport Jason to Scanton to continue his studies. Dr. Roward LaFontaine thinks it's an insane risk and tries to stop them, but they don't listen. When they go to unveil Jason, however, they instead find the guard in charge of watching Jason, bound and dead. Jason emerges, killing the soldiers and Dr. Wimmer. Dr. LaFontaine evades with Jason in steady pursuit. She lures him into the cryogenic chamber, but he ruptures the seal with his machete, trapping both of them.

Professor Brandon Lowe takes his students on a field trip to Earth I. There, they explore the remnants of the Crystal Lake Research Facility. They discover the cryonic chamber and open it up to find Jason mid-attack. Buried under tubing, they also discover Dr. LaFontaine. She is in sufficient condition for them to revive her. Jason, they believe, is too far gone, but they try to gather what they can from the occipital cortex. They bring them on the Grendel, their ship, and revive Dr. LaFontaine. When Professor Lowe learns who Jason is, he plans to sell him for a fortune.

Of course, while everyone is fucking (it's a Friday the 13th movie after all), Jason regains consciousness and starts killing. Will anyone survive trapped on this ship?

The Syfy Channel-grade CGI, sets, and costumes are kind of charming. Not bad for a $14 million budget. The gore is cheap, but over-the-top and nauseating, as per usual.

The movie definitely has a sense of humor. It's a shitty sense of humor, though. It's things like Professor Lowe likes being submissive and getting his nipples clamped. Or women being men. Hilarious, right?

The action beats are so rote, and the score accentuating them is so clichéd. It's challenging to stay invested once the action begins. The movie tries to poke fun at the franchise, but in the process, it undermines every kill.

As an adult, Paula is Alice's spitting image, practicing with Signore Guardi for an upcoming opera. Paul looks happier, but sings worse with each passing week, as she is in love with her accompanist, Signore Gregory Anton. Though they have only known each other for two weeks, Gregory wants to marry Paula. She asks for a week to think it over. When she gets to Lake Como, however, Gregory is waiting for her. At the Hotel Del Lago, they discuss where they will settle down. Gregory, since childhood, has longed to live in a London square. Paula reluctantly reveals that she inherited such a place, and they agree to live there.

No sooner than they arrive, Paula has traumatic flashbacks to the night of Alice's murder. But she forces herself to overcome them for Gregory's sake. Gregory sits at the piano and plays Alice's great song. While Paula looks through Alice's music, a note from an admirer named Sergis Bauer falls out. Gregory, in a rage, takes the note from her. Gregory resolves to hide all of Alice's belongings in the attic so as not to remind Paula of the murder.

The film follows Paula and Gregory's relationship as Paula begins to experience missing items, strange noises, and the dimming of gaslights when Gregory isn't home.

The production design is gorgeous and meticulous, placing us firmly in Victorian London. The lightning is immaculate, making subtle shifts with the dimming of gaslights and along the angles of actors' faces, giving the film an almost noir quality. I love the shimmering jewels sound effect!

As the term ""gaslighting"" has exploded in popularity, it's almost impossible to watch this movie and not intuit the direction the film takes. The audience might notice it beginning when Gregory tells the cook and maid that Paula is ""high-strung,"" although they have not witnessed any behavior to suggest this. Then, he suggests to Paula that she is forgetful.

This routine becomes difficult to stomach over the nearly two-hour runtime. Though I appreciate the slow burn, we know too much to be led down such similar paths for so much of the movie. But it's all worth it for the climax, holy shit. 

<b>*** ACTOR TALK ***</b>
* Ingrid Bergman's performance is the film's glue. We don't have to believe what Gregory says, but that Paula does and believably so. She has some incredible scenes that give me chills!
* We get Angela Lansbury in her first film role! She brings so much character to every line she delivers.
* Charles Boyer is infuriating, but I guess he's supposed to be.
* I love how much of the plot leans on Dame May Whity being a loudmouth.
* Joseph Cotton is forever underappreciated, but he doesn't get to do much here.

Overall, I adore this Gothic noir set in Victorian England.","torrent, oh my horror, omh, omh2025, 1001 movies, house of psychotic women, film noir",2025-08-03

A hand lights a gas stove. Cut to a furnace burning in a factory. Donny watches the furnace churn before a coworker, Ben, shuts it to protect his eyes. In another stove is a flammable, pressurized canister. Ben stokes the fire, causing the canister to explode, setting Ben on fire. Donny stares in horrified fascination, unable to move, as other workers rush in to put out the fire, yelling at Donny for doing nothing. Donny mumbles something about the cover of the flame protecting Ben.

Donny returns home to the house he shares with his mother. He starts on her tea, lighting a match to ignite the gas stove. A child's voice in Donny's head begs his mother not to. Donny brings the tea up to his mother's room only to find her dead. The shock overwhelms him, but voices in the house tell him that he is free and that they will help him. Then, another voice that sounds like his mother chastizes him. The other voices tell Donny that the flame must purify her.

A flashback shows Donald's mother calling him into the kitchen when he is a child. She ""burns the evil out of him"" by holding his arms over the stove fire. The next day, Donny calls in sick to work to line the upstairs with aluminum. His coworker and friend, Bobby, calls to check on him, thinking it's about Ben, but Donny barely remembers. He stops by a flower shop to get flowers for his ""sick"" mother. As he and the florist, Kathy, leave the shop, Kathy misses her bus, so Donny offers her a ride. He asks if he can drop the flowers off at his house first, making excuses after excuses to get her into the house. When she tries to call a cab, he knocks her out.

When Kathy comes to, she is naked and chained up in a room lined with aluminum. Donny enters wearing a fire-retardant suit, carrying a flamethrower. The film follows Donny as he goes on his path to purify the sinful, all while the line between reality and his mind crumbles around him.

I guess I saw an edited version of the movie, because the infamous murder scene is practically non-existent. This version only shows Kathy from the neck up and cuts as soon as the flamethrower cuts on. I'm not complaining — it's just interesting how tame this movie is otherwise. Don't get me wrong — this movie is still deeply fucked up. I'll let you discover how on your own.

The film explores the types of relationships that men form in their lives through Donny's traumatized lens. His mother acted as the all-knowing controller of his life, so when she died, he struggled to know what to do with himself. The voices in his head tell him to murder, but he also seeks the help of a priest, a friend from work, and a clothing salesman. All of them tell Donny what they think would make his life work, whether it's the lord, some babes, or a nice suit for the disco. All of them see facets of Donny, but none see the troubled person who doesn't trust himself.

It also doesn't help that Donny lies to try and impress people, the way kids make up stories to sound tough or important. I've known adults who never grew out of that compulsion, and you want to shake them and tell them it's okay to tell the truth, but they are too lost in their narrative.

In this way, the film gives an empathetic lead in Donny, much like <i>Maniac</i>. We don't root for Donny, but we understand, in part, why he does what he does. While you'll recognize the movies this one is riffing off of, this film stands on its own.

One of the best scenes is one where Donny dreams of explosions and emulsified bodies surrounding him, crawling out of the ground to drag him down. Also, the ending is totally unhinged.

The film also has a queer reading, especially once the disco comes into play, but the narrative is too problematic through that lens for me to chase down that interpretation.","tubi, cmc, cmc2018, edited by women, slasher, video nasties",2025-08-05

<b>Sekinchan, Sabak Bernam, 1993</b>

Ten-year-old Orked gets out of her Chinese school for the holiday. Her teacher talks to her in Mandarin about doing a writing assignment over the break. Going home, Orked encounters the boys, who are bullying and roughhousing with one another. At home, Orked's mother, Mak Inom, worries that Orked's position at the library will lead to her reading too much and falling behind on her studies. Orked's father, Pak Atam, speaking Malay, isn't so sure and returns to his band. The housekeeper, Kak Yam, joins the band in a song. As they sing on the porch, the rain pours. Her Orked and her mother dance in the rain to the music.

Ayu and other friends come to Orked's to ask her to play, but Orked hides under the bed. Her father agrees to take her to a football game if she goes and plays. The kids gossip about Orked's parents, saying her mother is becoming white because she speaks English, and that she must be a bad wife because her father ""has to"" help around the house. Orked leaves the girls to ask about a twelve-year-old boy playing in the yard named Mukhsin. When one of the boys gets injured, they suggest Orked jump in. Mukhsin is reluctant because she's a girl, thinking she isn't tough enough. When Orked nails Mukhsin with a rock, he agrees. 

Later, Mukhsin comes looking for her. She rides on the front of his bike, steering while Mukhsin pedals. They visit an old fountain, which has a traditional story associated with it regarding a virginal girl who disappeared. They begin to spend more time together, bringing Orked's troubles into Mukhsin's life.

The film is a cute portrayal of children's life in northern Malaysia, but also explores the subtle tensions between traditional life and the Western ways of living coming into the country. We see this through Mak Inom, who primarily speaks English and was educated in England. The neighbors think she has forgotten her Malay and Javanese roots. Also, Orked's family breaks from traditional gender roles, with Pak Atam helping around the house, leading to further neighborhood gossip. Even Orkid's name is rooted in the English word, orchid.

As the film progresses, however, we see the troubled lives of some of these neighbors. Ayu, who bullies Orked more than anyone, has a father who secretly cheats on her mother, taking young women out on dates on his moped. The mother's anxieties around this trickle down to Ayu, who becomes the voice of her mother's insecurities. We also learn about Mukhsin's family and the abusive household his mother ran away from. 

The film contrasts this with the deep love between Orked's parents. Their household is where most of the film's comedic moments occur. We get a funny scene where Mak Inom puts on a show of taking a switch to Orked's room to whip her as punishment for throwing a kid's backpack out the window. From outside, it sounds like Orked is getting it. But in the room, we see the mom is whipping the bed while Orked pretends to scream out in pain, and they discuss the problem together in the breaks between whips.

The storytelling is slight, and the camera often watches from a distance, taking on the distancing flatness of mid-00s indies, but without the ironic disposition that they usually take for humorous effect. The results are predominantly long-take, middle-distance shots with few, if any, cuts during each scene. I guess that these choices were budgetary more than stylistic. It's not difficult to read the intentions of each scene, but it's amusing how much more attention the film requires because of these choices.

I'm curious about the other films in the Orked trilogy. I already had Rabun in my watchlist, but it isn't considered part of the trilogy despite having some of the same characters because different actors portray them. I didn't realize that director Yasmin binti Ahmad's films were quite controversial when they first came out for their depictions of socially taboo subject matter. Her films received a reevaluation since her passing in 2009, citing her as a central figure of Malaysian New Wave cinema.

I didn't know about the conservative Muslim movement, nor Arabic influence on Malay, which this film depicts briefly with Orked's family praying and one child's father taking a second wife, which is only allowed in Malaysia to practicing Muslims.

I was going to say the casting for Orked's mom is top-notch due to their resemblance to one another. It turns out that they're sisters in real life!

I started watching this movie ages ago but had a hard time getting into it due to its mild-mannered storytelling. I'm glad I gave it another go — its sweetness and cultural specificity are welcome change-ups to my usual film-watching habits.

On a beach, in a shimmering vapor, Ilias receives his chestplate. His father blesses him and gives him the bow of Cronos before Ilias takes a boat and goes into the ""very dark and evil domain.""

In a haze of smoke, hairy tribal people look on as a horde of dog monsters stands on the horizon. Their leader, Ocron, stands nude except for a mask, chanting as though summoning the sun. The people offer Ocron a meager amount of meat. Lest you forget, this is Fulci, a dog monster axes a dude in the head, and his scalp just flies off, blood shooting everywhere. Then they take a woman from the village and rip her into pieces to serve Ocron. Ocron cracks the woman's head open like a coconut and eats the brains.

I think Ocron fucks a snake? She receives a vision of Ilias, without a face, pulling back his bow and shooting her with a blue arrow of light. So, she sends her creatures to find this guy. They witness Ilias shoot a snake in the head to save a tribal woman. The men try to chase down Ilias and capture him, but are stopped by an outlaw named Mace, who swings bone nunchaku at them.

Ilias and Mace team up to rid the land of evil, get laid, and stuff.

Is this movie Fulci's homage to Bava? I may like this more than most sword & sorcery movies, but I'm still not a super fan of the genre. It's nonsense, but it's entertaining nonsense.

I recommend being high! If you think you're missing the plot, don't worry, there isn't any!

<b>*** Stray Thoughts ***</b>
* The film has scenes where the shot is crossfaded with a background shot, giving everything a haziness. There's smoke, gauze, light refractions — everything they can do to obscure the image and make it look, I don't know, ethereal?
* Claudio Simonetti's bringing that 80s Italian shimmer with his score, and it enhances the movie so much.
* I love the subtitle's choices for what constitutes ""romantic"" or ""cheery"" music.
* The furry monsters look like Party City Chewbacca costumes.
* I'm glad zombies could make a cameo from every other Fulci movie.
* The shredded condom mummies were something else.
* The cinematography is quite well done in places. Alejandro Ulloa knows how to make this cheap as hell movie feel a little less cheap.
* This movie is one of two that Letterboxd put in the ""Gory, Naked, Sexy"" nanogenre. The other film is Tintorea: Killer Shark.
* Oh, hell yeah, heroic dolphins.
* Ilias nearly dies so many times. Thank god he found Mace or he'd be fucked a million times over.
* The blacklight cave where everyone glows blue like Dr. Manhattan. Maybe the darkest scene of any movie ever. Like, the lighting, not the content.

If you've seen movies, this one tells you its deal almost immediately, so it's less a matter of what is happening and more why. The strength of the movie lies in its characters, whom the movie gives most of its runtime to developing. Whether it matters in the end is up to the individual.

<blockquote><i>For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.</i> — Psalm 91</blockquote>

<blockquote><i>Vengeance is a lazy form of grief.</i> — Nicole Kidman</blockquote>

Sophia drives through the desolate Welsh countryside, arriving at an isolated house. With few questions and no requests, she rents the space for a year. She pays the broker in cash, with an additional sum added for his silence. She then drives to the train station to pick up Joseph Solomon—not her first choice, as he is quite disagreeable, but the one who agreed to help her. Sophia has already started purifying herself, following the dietary and ritualistic restrictions to prepare for the rite.

She shows Joseph the rite, coming from the Abramelin. She tells Joseph that she ""loves someone, and they don't love her anymore."" Joseph refuses, demanding his pay so he can go back to London. Sophia, a full-blown moron, waits until they get back to the train station to tell him that her child died, and it's her fault. The rite is to speak to her son again. Joseph agrees, but has to detox from his alcohol abuse before they can begin. He hides away an emergency bottle, because of course he does.

Before they can begin, Sophia's younger sister, Victoria, tracks her down. Victoria asks about Sophia's stint in the psychiatric hospital and whether Joseph knows. Victoria worries that what she's doing is against God. But Sophia doesn't care. She is going to go through with it. The film follows the preparation and execution of the months-long ritual while the two seal themselves away in the house.

The film, like many horror films, is a meditation on grief. This one is, perhaps, one of the most literal, as the ritual has many stages that repeat and loop onto each other. Even when there are signs that it might be working, Sophia's faith in the process falters. If they try to stop the ritual at any point, they will be stuck in the house for eternity. If you do not process your grief, you will always carry it with you.

<blockquote><i>When will we know when it's started? How do we know that it's working?</i></blockquote>

The film is a slow-burning, focusing on each aspect of the ritual, their failures and successes. We are pulled into Sophia's wavering faith that something, anything, is happening. Joseph seems to know how to handle each step, but as he is a recovering alcoholic and full of anger, it's hard to trust him.

Joseph also seems to be someone haunted by grief. He has seen too much, and besides the money he gets from Sophia, he has his motivations for performing the ritual. But he knows, or at least strongly believes, that it works — that he has the secret mechanisms of the universe at his fingertips. They just happen to be dark, painful, and unbearably difficult.

I wouldn't go into this movie looking for spooks and scares. It's almost unfair to put this in the horror genre, even though there are plenty of horror moments throughout. Also, several people dislike the ending. I understand why, but I believe it's because they brought the wrong expectations.

Overall, the filmmaking is sharp, especially for a first film. Not something I plan to revisit anytime soon, but one I recommend for folks who like a strong emotional core to their genre flicks.","torrent, oh my horror, omh, omh2025, edited by women, religious horror, folk horror",2025-08-13

The film has plenty of references for horror and reality TV fans, including a particular red dress and hairstyle from <i>Perfect Blue</i> that one ghostress utilizes. In that way, the film cleverly compares the desire of reality TV contestants to be seen to a ghost that haunts a space. Their existence builds on the external validation of others — to disappear is to lose meaning. So, like the contemporary influencer, these ghosts must consistently make the news with their scares, and so put on outrageous personas to stand out from the others.

A robotic voice reads the production credits before Howlin' Wolf's Smokestack Lightning kicks on, introducing us to auto mechanic Grey Trace's workshop, where he's fixing up a '77 Pontiac Trans Am. When the car successfully turns over, he opens the garage to see his wife, Asha, ride up in a futuristic self-driving car. Grey asks Asha to drive behind him in the car so that he can drop off the Thunderbird. They drive to a beach, and go down a stairway hidden between two rocks into a futuristic home of Eron Keen, a tech innovator. Eron shows them a chip named STEM, an uber-brain that Eron claims can do anything a brain can do, but better.

On their way home, the self-driving car malfunctions and drives them in the wrong direction. The car throws an error, speeds up, and crashes next to an unhoused encampment. A car drives up behind them. Four men get out and cover their faces. They drag Asha and Grey out. A drone watches them. A guy takes his mask off and gives a speech about being uneducated before shooting and killing Asha. They shoot Grey in the neck—he lives, but cannot move his body.

Three months later, Grey is quadriplegic, living with his mother and some voice-controlled arms that can perform basic functions like making protein shakes. Detective Cortez is working on finding their attackers, but to no avail. At home, Grey tries to overdose, but the house stops him just before the fatal dose. Back in the hospital, Eron visits him and offers him STEM, which will, among other things, allow him to move his body again. The only catch? He must sign a confidentiality agreement.

<i>Robocop</i> meets <i>Death Wish</i> — Grey is obviously a pawn in a tech war, but to what end?

The film establishes a juxtaposition between a world in which technology can cater to one's every whim and Grey's love of the manual and hands-on approach. Asha wants to print a pizza while Grey wants to make one. When Eron introduces STEM, Grey questions whether it can make babies or play football. Even with all the cameras and drones monitoring their movement, they cannot help the police find Asha's killer. So, thematically, the film explores what makes humans, well, human.

This contrasts with Grey's life with STEM. Not only does it help him move, but it also communicates with him and acts as a detective/advisor, finding clues that no human could. It also makes him a superhero, basically. When STEM takes over, the fights are so fun, and Logan Marshall-Green's physicality is sharp. The gore is gross and realistic. Folks seem to like that — I'm totally over it.

The film engages in some tired Hollywood cliches — namely, killing a woman to motivate the hero, and making him a miserable person who cannot be happy when he is rendered paraplegic. I'm not going to downplay or claim to understand the latter, but in terms of representation, it does more harm than good, especially when Grey rubs his ability to move in another person in a wheelchair. Or, when his mother finds out and says, ""Now you can start living again!""

The score has some great moments — nothing inventive, but hits when it needs to.

<b>B is for Bigfoot — Adrian Garcia Bogliano **.5</b>
Xochitl finds her babysitters, Dulce and Erik, snogging on the couch. So, to get her to go to bed, they make up a story about the Abominable Snowman taking away children who stay up late.

No surprises, but the result is at least competent.


<b>C is for Cycle — Ernesto Diaz Espinoza *.5</b>
Bruno finds a puddle of blood in his yard. At night, he hears a sound. In the morning, his wife is gone. Also, he finds a hole in the bushes.

For such a short film, you'd think they could logic out the order of operations, but it's nonsense.


<b>D is for Dogfight — Marcel Sarmiento *.5</b>
A man enters an underground fighting ring and fights a dog.

Nonsense, but decent cinematography and over-the-top sound design. I know it's pretend, but I still don't want to see someone pretend to hit a dog.


<b>E is for Exterminate — Angela Bettis ***</b>
A man tries to kill a spider in his apartment. Meanwhile, he wakes up with more and more spider bites.

This is likely why I put this anthology on my list, because I wanted to see what Angela Bettis would do. It's silly, but it comes together nicely.


<b>F is for Fart — Noboru Iguchi **.5</b>
Yoshie wishes she didn't have to be so ashamed whenever she farts. She's also obsessed with her teacher, Miss Yumi.

Softcore fart porn with a marginally higher-than-usual budget. I mean, the director is literally a fetish porn director. It's so brazen that I respect it. 


<b>G is for Gravity — Andrew Traucki *.5</b>
A surfer brings his board and a bag of bricks to the beach.

Beyond the novelty of the POV camera, this one doesn't do much.


<b>H is for Hydro-Electric Diffusion — Thomas Mailing **.5</b>
It's World War II, but everyone's a furry.

It's porn, duh, but it's so unbelievably weird that I'm at least on board.


<b>I is for Ingrown — Jorge Michel Garu **</b>
A man has his wife tied up in the bath, and he keeps injecting her with motor oil.

I appreciate how the short is trying to bring awareness to women's abuse, but it does so by portraying horrific abuse.


<b>J is for Jidai-geki — Yūdai Yamaguchi **</b>
An executioner is preparing to decapitate a samurai, but the samurai keeps making weird faces. Like, really weird.

I liked some of the faces the samurai made.


<b>K is for Klutz — Anders Morgenthaler *.5</b>
A woman takes a shit at a party, but it won't flush.

Yep, it's porn. It's animated, at least.


<b>L is for Libido — Timo Tjahjanto *</b>
Two men are naked, strapped to chairs, and forced to masturbate to increasingly disturbing things.

It's porn. Not a big Tjahjanto fan.


<b>M is for Miscarriage — Ti West *</b>
A woman attempts to unclog her toilet.

¯\_(ツ)_/¯


<b>N is for Nuptials — Banjong Pisanthanakun *.5</b>
Shane flirts with Ann via a parrot he just bought. But the parrot knows more than it lets on.

Good, uh, parrot performance?


<b>O is for Orgasm — Hélène Cattet and Bruno Forzani **</b>
Two people have sex with surreal and violent imagery accompanying them.

Wait, the one called ""O is for Orgasm"" is pornography??


<b>P is for Pressure — Simon Rumley **.5</b>
A sex worker cares for her three kids. She's getting by, but her kid's birthday is coming up. So, when her boyfriend steals her savings, she takes an unusual request.

Seems transgressive for its own sake. I like the director, and I like how this short is directed, but I hate the direction the narrative takes.


<b>Q is for Quack — Adam Wingard and Simon Barrett **</b>
Directors Adam Wingard and Simon Barrett resent getting the letter Q.

Making it meta doesn't make it clever.


<b>R is for Removed — Srđan Spasojević *</b>
A bandaged man repeatedly gets his skin cut off so they can use it as 35 mm film.

FUCK, I didn't know Srđan Spasojević was involved with this. I'm so pissed. Of course, this is disgusting to watch.


<b>S is for Speed — Jake West *.5</b>
Roxanne kidnaps Lulu while they are pursued by a hooded figure that cannot die. Oh, and it's in the desert and sort of Western-y.

It has the aesthetic of a Suicide Girls shoot. This short makes Requiem for a Dream seem subtle.


<b>T is for Toilet — Lee Hardcastle **</b>
Two parents teach their child how to use the toilet. The line between nightmare and reality blurs.

Like a cheaper and extra gory Celebrity Death Match.


<b>U is for Unearthed — Ben Wheatley **.5</b>
A vampire evades a mob attempting to kill him.

Another POV short. I appreciate the conceit, even if the execution only mildly works.


<b>V is for Vagitus — Kaare Andrews *.5</b>
In 2035, women will have to petition the government to bear children. A police officer and her robot assistant break into a facility to eliminate a baby born to a psychic.

Way too convoluted for the time allotted, so it's just people explaining everything the whole time. It would've been better as a comic. Makes sense, since Kaare Andrews is a comic book artist.


<b>W is for WTF! — Jon Schnepp **</b>
In shitty Adult Swim animation style, a witch feels up a naked woman before stabbing her. A knight comes to save her, but the warlock kills them. Then it goes meta.

Probably the most effortful of any of the shorts. It's so goofy and disgusting.


<b>X is for XXL — Xavier Gens *</b>
Surrounded by images of thin women, Gertrude must bear constant berating from strangers about her weight.

What a French-ass short — nothing is scarier than being above the median weight.


<b>Y is for Youngbuck — Jason Eisener *</b>
A janitor teaches a student how to hunt deer and then sexually assaults him. The janitor's proclivities go to disgusting lengths.

This is shot like a comedy. You know, rape revenge, but it's a child. Hilarious, right?


<b>Z is for Zetsumetsu — Yoshihiro Nishimura **</b>
I think I got too high to understand this one. It's like, Dr. Strangeluv is shown a bizarre depiction of how similar America and Japan are.

It's <i>Tokyo Gore Police</i> dude being the horniest weirdo he can be. There's a shot where a woman with enormous breasts has a depiction of 9/11 painted on them, and she's shaking them about.","amazon prime, oh my horror, omh, omh2025, horror anthology",2025-08-27

Kang Yu-jin drives up to his beautiful house on the hill, where his daughter runs out to greet him. His daughter, Gyeong-a, and wife, Seon-hee, come out to greet him after his 17-day butterfly expedition. Yu-jin tells Seon-hee to invite several important people over, as he has made a rare discovery. Seon-hee is visibly disappointed that they won't be spending the night as a family. So, Yu-jin lays a big smooch on her to smooth things over. That night, the boys gather around a projector, where Yu-jin shows them pictures of butterflies.

Then, for some reason, a slide appears depicting a wooden doll. Yu-jin doesn't know what it is, but the sight of it causes Seon-hee to shudder. Later, Seon-hee confesses to Yu-jin that the doll upset her, like a bad omen. Yu-jin tells her that he is leaving again in three days to find a rare butterfly that he was unable to catch. Later, Seon-hee's friend tells Seon-hee to watch her husband, because he might be cheating.

When Yu-jin returns from a trip, he has a young woman with him. The woman, Mi-ok, lost her mother, the town shaman, in a house fire and is all alone. Since the family needs a new housemaid, Yu-jin thought she could take the job. Seon-hee cannot help but notice that Mi-ok has a rocking bod. Mi-ok clings to something wrapped in a blanket, unwilling to set it down. When no one is around, she unveils and prays to it. It is the white doll from the photos.

What is this doll? What are Mi-ok's intentions? Or is all of this suspicion in Seon-hee's head?

<blockquote><i>We're both going to live here until we die.</i></blockquote>

The cinematography is quite fluid, dollying throughout the house, adding a sense of drama to even the most mundane scenes. Many of these shots center on Seon-hee, providing a deeper insight into her mental state and perspective. Additionally, the film employs Dutch angles when filming Mi-ok, suggesting that something is amiss with her before the events unfold.

The score is eerie and psychedelic, accompanied by shots filmed through prisms to create geometric patterns and mirrors. It also helps mask some of the cheaper effects in some shots, but it does it quite effectively. The weirdness of the score continues into the sex scenes, which makes them feel off-kilter, as if something bad might happen.

The film has the most fun with hallucinations and dreams, pushing the boundaries with dissonant synthesizers, sharp angles, and colors that bleed into the frame.

Kim Young-ae, who plays Seon-hee, is the best actor in the film by a mile. Much of the film is a psychological exploration of her mental state. While, as stated above, the filmmaking helps convey her mental state, her acting also provides the subtleties that round out what cinematography alone cannot say. It's not like this is a super subtle movie, though. She also has elaborate dream sequences of the doll and Mi-ok seducing Yu-jin.

The family has embraced many Western aesthetics and values. Mi-ok, coming from a rural village that practices Korean shamanism, reflects more traditional views. Seon-hee's fear is a sublimation of a statement made by one of Yu-jin's colleagues about shamanism — that, while it doesn't have the scientific rigor of modern medicine, it still seems to fill a gap that science has not. Seon-hee is the contemporary wife, afraid that the traditional ways will steal her husband from her. The pharmacy prescribes her tranquilizers to help her sleep, which, um, won't help with the vivid dreams of her husband cheating.

We also get the sense that the old ways are fighting for their own survival. Yu-jin's colleagues discuss how pesticides are making some of Korea's native butterfly populations dwindle. Science, in its efforts to possess and know, is erasing traditional ways, so they must retaliate.

Yes, this film is yet another hysterical wife movie, but the surreal filmmaking and grounded performances help it stand out from the standard fare. The ending alone pushed it up a half-star.","amazon prime, asiancinemachallenge2023, asiancc2023, asiancc2023week15, killer toy",2025-09-01

On September 30th, Tom Corman sits at his typewriter, writing a byline for the local paper about a strange occurrence that has changed everything.

Mr. and Mrs. Griffith paddle through the dark Southern swamps on a fly-by-night mission to find gators. You'd think that would be easy in these swamps, but no one has spotted one in ages. Mr. Griffith hopes, if nothing else, to find an alligator corpse or two at the bottom of the water. They arrive at what used to be a gator haven. Mr. Griffith fires a revolver into the water, sending Mrs. Griffith to fetch his kill. But something drags her into the deep.

Game warden Miller Haze visits the local paper to brag about an 18-pound bass he caught. They look at the pictures and see signs that the bass is merely a baby. What could make a baby bass grow to such a size? Haze goes over to Sheriff Kowalski's to play poker with him and Tom. While discussing rebuilding the old town bridge, Griffith runs in, panicked. Something caught Mrs. Griffith, and he has no clue what it was, but it sure as hell wasn't a gator. It looked like something rotten.

Ever since that houseboat sank, nothing's been the same. Tom's on the case, chasing leads and Emmett Michael's daughter, Shawn.

<blockquote><i>— Buddy, can you keep something under your hat?
</i><i>— It's a pretty big hat.</i></blockquote>
The cinematography is solid, erring on being too distant from the actors to avoid having to shoot coverage. The lighting is non-existent, and this is particularly noticeable during the day, as they make no effort to illuminate what the canopy shade obscures.

The zombie effects range from simple blue makeup to cheap rubber masks and gloves. The gore isn't too bad in a couple of places, and a couple of the kills are surprisingly decent, but none of it is special. It works best when they lean into wet goop.

The story spends too much time with the locals, letting their antics fill out the already slight runtime. Thankfully, the filmmakers are not shy about killing them off. Still, there are too many kill scenes, and too many that are similar to one another. In case you have forgotten that this is a Fred Olen Ray movie, the film has an extended skinny-dipping scene. And this is in addition to a sheer clothing swimming scene.

Buster Crabbe is slumming in this no-budget shlock, but he makes a meal of his scenes without chewing the scenery. He, and everyone else in this movie, has a fake southern accent. None of them is intolerably hammy, but they push it.

The movie has a couple of comedic moments that are charming, only because the extras and more minor roles can't help but break character or make eye contact with the camera. Any sign that someone had fun making this is welcome in my book.

I think you know already that this movie doesn't have much going for it. That said, I can't say I was ever bored. Then again, I have a high tolerance for these types of movies.","amazon prime, rental, scifiploitation, zombies",2025-09-02

Frank White leaves his jail cell in Sing Sing Penitentiary. Two guards walk him past cells and out to his freedom. A black limo picks him up and brings him to a gated compound. El Zapa, a Colombian cartel boss, wanders a brothel, feeling up the passed-out women before getting dressed and heading out to make a phone call at the phone booth. He feels the doors slam shut as three men fill him with lead. As El Zapa dies, one man shows him a newspaper headline: ""Frank White released from prison.""

Test Tube sits in the Travelodge Hotel, testing coke that he and Jimmy Jump are buying from King Tito. Tito gets impatient and raises the cost. Jimmy Jump accepts the offer and sets down a large briefcase. Tito opens it to find it full of tampons. You know, to plug the bullet holes. Test Tube and Jimmy Jump get the jump on Tito and his men, taking them out.

Between hits, we see White riding through the lower-income streets of NYC in his limo. He goes to the plaza with two women and meets with the assassinating gangsters we've met thus far. The film pretends that they're there to take Frank out, but they celebrate Frank's return and give him the good news about the Colombians. Frank meets with some friends at the restaurant downstairs, where he announces that prison reformed him and he plans on running for mayor.

The movie follows Frank as he pursues his contradictory aspirations of ruling the underworld and going legit. Or do both serve the same purpose? Will the police, who catch onto Frank's escapades, find a way to bring him down?

It's wild to think that folks shunned this movie for being too violent. So many movies inject unnecessary gore these days that what we see here is quaint by comparison. Not that it doesn't hit — its reputation for violence has merely diminished over the years.

The screenplay is a crackerjack box of expectation reversals and tension. The pacing is *chef's kiss*. The anti-powers-that-be messaging is as relevant as ever. The third act really ramps it up with well-choreographed shootouts, coherent car chases, and endless rain. It plays out like an opera.

Even before Ferrera made <i>The Addiction</i>, he had a thing for vampires — here, it's subtle until it isn't, what with the Triad members watching Nosferatu. Frank is a sudden force taking over the city. Also, there's some unambiguous homoeroticism, a prerequisite of every good Dracula adaptation.

Anna Graham carries flowers through Highgate Cemetery to her mother's grave. The birds caw, the bell tolls — the cemetery is closing. Three blonde women with grayish skin greet Anna, pulling her in.

The doorbell rings, waking the sleeping Graham Ford. At the door is a Reverend Ford and his wife, Alicia. They claim to be distant relatives. Graham invites them in, and they plan for Graham and his wife, Anna, to come over for dinner. The reverend intends to reopen the All Saints Church, beside Carfax Abbey, after its 10-year slumber — a church about a block away from Highgate Cemetery. Speaking of which, Anna should have been back an hour ago. As the Reverend and Alicia exit, a disheveled Anna pours in. When her eyes meet the Reverend's, she lets out a concerned gasp.

Emma Ford brushes her hair as the maid helps her dress. She hopes to see Mr. Willis, whom she wishes to marry. The doorbell rings. The maid answers to find a hunched-over teen with a box of flowers for Ms. Ford. The maid takes the flowers, closes the door, and turns around to see one of the gray (closer to green now) women. She beckons the maid and whispers something in her ear. The maid walks upstairs in a trance to deliver the flowers. Ms. Ford cuts her finger on one of the flowers before leaving. The maid grabs a shard of glass onto which Ms. Ford's blood fell and calls for the other gray women.

Susan Ford goes to Carfax Abbey to meet with the Reverend. While waiting, she sees the same blonde boy who delivered the flowers rush by, cackling. The Reverend, Alicia, and Susan convene to discuss the Reverend's familial relationship to her. And how The Reverend is reopening the church next door. They toast over Susan's wine and the Reverend and Alicia's ""tomato juices."" Susan feels lightheaded and faints. The Reverend calls in Spool, the blonde boy, who carries Susan to a bedroom on the second floor.

Who are The Reverend and Alicia? What is their plan with their family members? With the church?

I have to say, I was pretty invested in the story. We meet a sprawling cast before anything happens in the movie, but some minor seeds of intrigue are peppered throughout.

The film has a sense of humor, but getting on its wavelength is difficult. Jokes seem to be things like the Reverend being a pompous know-it-all.

The filmmaking isn't stunning, but it's competently put together, especially considering the low budget with which they made this film. Cameras dolly, rooms are lit, and the pacing isn't a total slog. Scenes run a little long and end at awkward junctures. Cuts between shots repeat parts of the previous cut with a different angle.

Deeply flawed, but admirable in it's ambition, the film probably won't wow anyone who isn't horror-poisoned like me, but I found enough charm to keep me watching.

Cut to Wong Chi Hang working at the Eight Immortals Restaurant. A man delivers a letter for Cheng Lam, which Vong takes and rips up. Vong goes to a lawyer with the deed for Eight Immortals Restaurant to sign over from its previous owner, Cheng Lam, to him. But without any signature or approval from Cheng Lam, who has mysteriously vanished, the lawyer can do nothing for him.

What will the police investigation reveal? Where is Cheng Lam? What heinous things is Wong Chi Hang up to?

The Chinese title, 八仙飯店之人肉叉燒包, which translates to something like ""Eight Immortal Restaurant Human Meat Buns"", refers to the infamous murders that occurred at the Eight Immortals Restaurant in Macau in 1985, on which the filmmakers based this movie. Americans would have probably considered that title a spoiler since they were likely unfamiliar with the news story.

The film has a black comedy tone to it, especially with the police detectives. They all seem inept or amateurish, and their understandably grossed-out response to the evidence is the source of several hijinks.

The special effects are sufficiently realistic to induce a nausea response in me, especially with characters responding to them as though they are disgusting. The kills are also pretty grisly, even when they have a comedic touch. And of course, Wong can't just kill the women victims, he has to graphically SA them first. So, I understand the CAT III rating on this one.

I could do without the subplot where Bo, the only woman detective, tries to convince the other detectives that she's hot enough for them to lust after. Also, the third act gets a little tedious until the genuinely disturbing finale — I won't get into any specifics.

If I weren't a vegetarian before this movie, it would've definitely pushed me in that direction. Depending on the type of genre fan you are, that's either a warning or a ringing endorsement.

In the rural village of Midwich, Professor Gordon Zellaby makes a call to his brother-in-law, Major Alan Bernard, stationed a ways away. Mid-call, Gordon collapses on the ground. Alan makes repeated attempts to reconnect, but no one in town is answering. As we look around, we find that the farmer tilling the soil has also passed out. In fact, everyone in the village is incapacitated, including the animals. The clock strikes 11 o'clock.

Alan is already taking leave for the weekend, so he tells the higher-ups that he will investigate the cause. Upon arriving, he meets a police officer looking for a bus, which they locate together, crashed over the side of the road. As the officer approaches the bus, he suddenly collapses. Alan smartly turns tail and drives away, where he reports his findings.

The military arrives and cordon off the town, disguising it as a military training exercise. The soldiers take a canary and dip its cage across the line, where it immediately passes out. Once they pull it back, it comes right to. Dr. Willers arrives to see them repeat the exercise on a soldier in a gas mask. Overhead, they send a plane that can barely make out that no one is moving. Alan asks him over the radio to slowly descend, being sure to pull up the moment he feels anything. The pilot is too eager and dips at a point where he passes out, causing the plane to crash.

Suddenly, they see a cow in the pasture come to. Then, the folks in the bus pour out, woozy but conscious. Alan crosses the line to assist the officer who is awakening. What happened to them during these past couple of hours?

The movie unfolds in that steady, old British horror kind of way — each moment given enough time to convey what it can without rushing to get to any part. I love that, but I know some folks will find it slow-going, especially if you already know the story (either through the <a href=""https://boxd.it/6vpleb"">Carpenter remake</a> or the <a href=""https://youtu.be/pAJPf-I7PkM"">Simpsons episode</a>).

We also get that 50s-grade misogyny, as all the women are emotional and the men are rational. No surprise, given the times, but it's noticeable. George Sanders' tone makes every line out of his mouth sound like mansplaining. Slap a woman to break her out of her hysterics and whatnot. And, despite being about a small village, it still manages to throw in some racism against indigenous folks.

<blockquote><i>The revolution is not a social dinner, a literary event, a drawing, or an embroidery; it cannot be done with elegance and courtesy. The revolution is an act of violence...</i> — Mao Tse-Tung</blockquote>

<b>1913</b>
A barefoot Mexican man pees on an anthill as a storm starts to brew. He looks out across the Mexican countryside and sees a coach riding near. He ambles down to the roadside and signals the coach to stop. The man begs for them to take him to San Felipe, and they decide he's perfect to get a rise out of the passengers. They send him to the back of the coach, where he sees a group of wealthy Americans eating. They stare in horrified silence as he finds a place they'll allow him to sit. Once there, the rich people discuss the ongoing revolution, disparaging the Mexican people as ""animals"" and comparing them to the Black people back home (they use a different word).

The coach rides past a small village. Men sneak underneath and stop the carriage with rocks at the wheels and untether the horses from the carriage. They shoot the drivers and gunmen, then hold the passengers at gunpoint. One of the rich men goes for his gun, and they shoot him in the head. The Mexican man gets out of his seat and joins the assailants, robbing the wealthy people. The Mexican man drags one of the rich men outside to rough him up. He then assists the rich woman out, sending her to a pen with animals, where he SAs her. The Mexican man is the outlaw Juan Miranda, and this is his gang of bandits.

Just then, a bomb goes off. The bandits take the carriage closer to determine what's happening. Through the debris rides a man on a motorcycle. Juan shoots the back tire out on the motorcycle. Wasting no time, the motorcyclist dismounts his bike. He approaches the bandits and lights a cigarette. He enters the carriage and brings the children out before a bomb blows the roof off the carriage. The bandits draw their weapons. The man, speaking with an Irish accent, opens his jacket to reveal it lined with dynamite and a vial of liquid that creates explosions with merely a drop. The man with the explosives is named John H. Mallory, and the Irish government wants him for murder and terrorist activism. Juan imagines the banner for the Mesa Verde National Bank hovering over John's head.

The film follows Seán and John as they travel to Mesa Verde to rob a bank, only to become entangled in the Mexican Revolution.

<blockquote><i>I don't wanna be a hero! All I want is the money!</i></blockquote>

The film has a grittiness to it, pushing the violence onscreen and able to show it in the US due to relaxed Hayes Code censorship. It also plays in the moral ambiguity of the revisionist Western tradition, embracing the pacing of a psychological thriller to heighten the tension throughout. Sergio Leone claims he didn't mean for the film to be political, using the revolution as a symbol through which the naïve (Juan) befriends and teaches the intellectual (John). The film also conveys the disillusionment that comes when the revolution doesn't bring everything it promises.

<blockquote><i>Revolution? Please don't try to tell me about revolution. I know all about the revolutions and how they start. The people that read books, they go to the people that don't read books, the poor people, and say the time has come for a change… So the poor people make the change, huh? Then the people who read the books, they all sit around the big polished tables and talk and talk and eat and eat. But what has happened to the poor people? They're dead!</i></blockquote>

For Juan, his country is his family — the only people worth fighting or dying for. John fought for Ireland, but after becoming a fugitive, he brought his fight and explosives to the Mexican Revolution. Juan plants the same seed of disillusionment in John, causing him to reflect on his past and the beliefs that led him to this point.

The cinematographer, Giuseppe Ruzzolini, employs many techniques that Leone formulated with Tonino Delli Colli on films like <i>The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly</i> and <i>Once Upon a Time in the West</i>. Delli Colli returned for <i>Once Upon a Time in America</i> 13 years after this movie. I'm not saying Ruzzolini didn't bring his own touch, just that he also makes similar use of closeups. For example, during the dinner scene, the camera focuses intently on the rich people's eyes and their mouths as they spew their racist rhetoric and stuff their mouths. The compositions create an additional layer of disgust on the already rampant hate speech.

That said, the film still engages in plenty of unchecked racism, primarily through Juan Miranda, as played by white American actor Rod Steiger. His brownface, being a rapist, as well as having six kids, each with a different woman, is an unnecessary characterization for Miranda built from lazy stereotypes.

James Coburn is an intentional choice beyond his acting, as he had a storied career in Western films up to this point. Here, he upturns his heroic image while maintaining his reputation for ""cool."" It's just that, here, his cool comes with an ironic detachment.

Of course, I enjoyed the Ennio Morricone score — the drone elements are excellent grounding for the grit onscreen. Don't worry, we still get folks whistling and making noises in the score, especially in the moments played for comedic effect.

If Leone did not intend to make a political film, he failed. Here, intentionally or otherwise, he argues for the populist — no gods, no masters, no loyalty to anyone save those who will support your personal ideals. Currently, the United States is seeing the fruit of such beliefs in action.

Gao Wai-Tung's mother hurt her shoulder, so she records a tape of all the family updates to send to Wai-Tung in America. He listens to it while doing his gym routine. On the tape, his mother voices her desire for him to marry, and his father's desire for him to have a child. So, they enrolled Wai in a Taipei dating service. Little do they know that Wai-Tung is in a relationship with Simon — the two live together in Manhattan. Simon is frustrated because the two had planned a trip for months, but Wai cancelled at the last minute due to a sudden work obligation.

Wai is a landlord in Williamsburg. After dinner with Simon, he stops by to check on things. He rings his tenant, Wei-wei, to let him in so he can collect rent from her. She tries to pay with one of her abstract paintings, but Wai won't have it. However, after seeing the awful conditions she's living in (it isn't zoned for residency) and hearing about her job loss due to an immigration scare, he decides to take one of her paintings as rent. As he leaves, Wei-wei asks him to ask Simon to find a rich boyfriend for her.

That night, Wai fills out the mail-in paperwork for the Taipei dating service, detailing his ""ideal woman."" Simon doesn't understand why Wai won't come out to his family. Still, Wai and Simon fill out the form with impractical asks: a 2 PhD-holding opera singer who speaks five languages. Amazingly, the dating service finds a woman named Mao Mae who meets almost all the requirements (she only holds one PhD). Wai's parents fly her out to NY so they can meet. Wei-wei, working as a waiter, catches Wai on the date and threatens to tell Simon. Through this, Mao Mae confesses that she also has a white boyfriend that she doesn't want to tell her family about.

When Simon hears about Wei-wei's luck and inability to get a green card, he gets the idea that Wai-Tung should marry Wei-wei to help both of them out. The film follows the antics as the farce progresses. Will Wai come out to his family? Will Wai fulfill his father's wish to hold his grandchild before he dies?

The film is the second in a trilogy of films Ang Lee made, informally titled ""Father Knows Best,"" which explores the contrast of traditional Chinese family values and Western individualism. Here, Wai-Tung performs a traditional arrangement with Wei-wei, afraid to disappoint his parents by revealing his gay partner and thus his inability to fulfill that expected role. The younger generation may not remember or know the extent of gay ostracism in both the East and the West. In the US, gay men could not marry, let alone adopt, so Wai-Tung cannot satisfy both worlds.

The film's sense of humor gives the feeling that the jokes come from real places. The film never shows the obvious visual cues of a comedy on when to laugh, letting the humor come through organically. This subtle leaning also means that the film never makes jokes at the expense of its gay characters. No one is a stereotype beyond the plot contrivance itself.

Unlike most romcoms, this movie doesn't take melodramatic turns to create stakes — each moment feels like it has a touch of specificity. For example, I spotted them pulling Poison off the VHS shelf to hide that they're gay. That feels like a deep cut for general audiences, but I'm not sure if they saw this movie when it came out. Still, because it feels real, it got a laugh from me.

I love the look of the film! The 35mm film gives everything a warmth. The lighting is thoughtful but subtle, opting out of the romcom perspective of shimmering flatness in favor of real-world groundedness.

Nothing dates this movie more than Simon buying Wai a cellular phone as a birthday present. The thing looks like a walkie-talkie. 

From the premise, I was apprehensive about yet another gay panic farce. But the filmmaking and characters contain so much warmth and humor that I found myself charmed and emotionally invested throughout.

I'm so apprehensive about the new remake…

<blockquote><i>Freedom is obedience. Obedience is work. Work is life.</i></blockquote>

In the future year of 1995, we see footage of military men invading cities and mowing down and arresting protestors in droves. A van for a reeducation camp (Re-Ed) carries Chris, Rita, and Paul — social deviants by the current government's standards. Chris is a shopkeeper whom the police arrested when she begged them to stop beating up a man in her store. Paul runs a pirate radio station where he details the camps he has escaped. Someone turned Rita in for being a sex worker, though she denies it.

The Re-Ed van arrives at Camp 47. A prisoner sneaks underneath the van to escape. A whip-wielding guard named Red gives the new prisoners the rundown. We meet Camp Master Charles Thatcher (Thatcher, get it?) and Secretary Mallory as they detail how each handles the camp overcrowding problems. Mallory sees Chris on the security camera and details what he'd like to do to her. We then watch some assorted torture, women showering, guards murdering inmates — the usual fare.

Eventually, we meet Thatcher's accomplices and learn of a yearly hunt called the turkey shoot in which the accomplices hunt five prisoners over 12 hours. If the prisoners survive, they go free. Among the five selected this year are Chris, Rita, and Paul. Will our heroes survive? Will any of the assorted escape plans come to fruition?

<blockquote><i>Disobedience is treason. Treason is a crime. Crime will be punished.</i></blockquote>

Like director Brian Trenchard-Smith's <i><a href=""https://boxd.it/8FcB55"">Dead-End Drive-In</a></i>, the film spends much of its already brief runtime idling, attempting to say something about abusive power structures but never finding the precision necessary to say anything meaningful.

That said, I'm not sure the approach to this movie was all that serious to begin with. The filmmakers clearly tried to think of as many oddball tortures and means of killing people. For example, Thatcher puts Paul on a scale where the weight on one end keeps a rock from crushing him, but they slowly remove weights, forcing Paul to hold up the rock himself. Also, there's a wolf man?? He rips off a dude's toe. And there's a woman who is in horse-riding attire, just hunting on horseback?

Like much horror, he finds rage and fear, and uses that to fuel the regime. As with any governance that relies on punishment as retribution for crime, the definitions of crime fall into subjective hands, leading people who don't ""deserve"" punishment to receive it still. Chris doesn't understand why she's here — she never spoke out against the powers that be. But Rita assures her that it doesn't matter. If the government regime thinks you belong here, then no one can argue to the contrary.

The score uses the same synth as the lead in Daft Punk's ""Robot Rock."" I never get tired of wonky B-movie synth scores.

I'm not going to talk about the craft (cinematography and whatnot) because I could only find a pan-and-scan version, which feels unfair to judge. It doesn't look cheap.

Overall, pretty lukewarm on this one. The director has claimed it's ""satire."" I'm leaning more towards goofy. It's that goofiness that makes this entertaining, though.","amazon prime, cmc, cmc2018, scifiploitation, the most dangerous game, ozploitation",2025-09-12

Trimagasi discusses how the food they receive is what those above them dislike. Each month, they are assigned a new floor.

<b>Before there was <i>Airplane!</i>, there was <i>The Big Bus</i>.</b>

A man orders a Pepsi from a hot dog vendor just outside the Cyclops Nuclear Project site. And what is the Cyclops? It is the world's first nuclear-powered bus, which aims to make the first non-stop trip from New York City to Denver. The hot dog vendor looks in earnest at the bustle just beyond the gates. Guards check identification as people drive in and out. TV cameras, red ropes, and men in silver outfits — is it time for them to unveil the Cyclops?

Professor Baxter, the scientist in charge, delicately inserts the nuclear payload into a canister. Cut to outside, where the press and Kitty Baxter, daughter and designer, witness an explosion from within the warehouse. At that moment, the hot dog vendor runs away and dives into a passing Cadillac. The police and fire department arrive on the scene. The hot dog vendor arrives at a mansion, entering the office of Ironman, a tycoon inside an iron lung. All around his office are paintings of major disasters depicted in other 70s disaster flicks. 

Professor Baxter is critically wounded, and both drivers are dead. Professor Baxter, still conscious, knows one man who can drive that bus, and it's Dan Torrance, a former lover of Kitty's. Dan Torrance is a disgraced bus driver whose backstory I won't get into, but involves eating all of his passengers. Kitty tracks him down to recruit him for the job. But she has to train him first. Will Dan have what it takes? Will the Big Bus make its maiden trek across the US of A? Or will Ironman and his cronies wreck the whole affair?

This film is silly as hell. Every shot is aiming for at least one joke, so even if there's an eye-roller (this movie has several), you're not far from a satisfied snort or, hell, a mild chuckle. Stockard Channing grounds this movie, like Leslie Nielsen in <i>Airplane!</i>. She acts with deadly seriousness that makes her jokes that much funnier.

Speaking of <i>Airplane!</i>, it took over as THE disaster movie parody, becoming one of the most iconic comedies in film history. So, it makes sense that this movie sort of faded from cultural consciousness. It's also a shame, because this one is still plenty entertaining. I might argue that, with a few exceptions, this movie's sense of humor has aged better than <i>Airplane!</i>.

Like many disaster flicks, we get a stacked cast of oddball characters with backstories and whatnot. Thankfully, this movie knows that we don't care all that much, so it moves on quicker, but it does through those cliche beats at the most random times, which is pretty funny.

I like the bus design! The filmmakers drove it on the highway enough to get convincing external footage, although they never drove it 90mph :(. I love the rainbow colors inside! The bus drives so fast that it shatters gas station windows and blows away roadside tomato stands. The film has plenty of action set pieces, and some of them are pretty fun!

Like any comedy, your experience will largely depend on your sense of humor. If you like your jokes dumb and your sets stylish, you could do worse.

At District Crime Kowloon West, Detective Chan Kwai-Bun holds a knife as he circles a butchered pig hanging in the middle of his office. A newspaper headline states: ""Female Student Stabbed Over Ten Times."" Inspector Ho Ka-On enters the office to report for duty and sees several men observing Bun. Bun stabs the butchered pig repeatedly. Inspired, Bun grabs a suitcase large enough to hold himself and asks Inspector Ho to push Bun down the stairs while he is inside it. Ho obliges. Another newspaper headline states: ""New Breakthrough. Body Found in Suitcase."" At the bottom of the stairs, Ho lets out a dizzy Bun, who immediately determines that the ice cream shop owner is the killer. Unbelievably, this assertion is correct, and Bun has solved the case. Cut to Bun attending the police chief's retirement. Bun steps up and cuts off his ear to give to the chief. The police force him into early retirement. 

Three and a half years later, during a stakeout, officer Wong Kwok-Chu goes missing after he and his partner, Ko Chi-Wai, chase Naresh Sherma into the woods. Eighteen months pass with no sign of Wong. Bun reads the headlines at a convenience store while his wife, May Cheung, buys him candy bars. Bun and May return home to find Inspector Ho waiting for them. Ho asks Bun to help him with the case, telling him that Wong's gun has been used in several robberies despite him still being missing. May grows furious that Bun is even entertaining returning to police work and starts a fight. The confused Ho leaves as he witnesses Bun seemingly fighting with himself.

Still, Bun returns to the office to assist. Bun hears the voice of a doubting woman that no one else can see. The woman appears to be another personality inside a male detective, and Bun headbutts the woman/detective in the face. After watching Officer Ko's testimony, Bun and Ho tail him. While Ho only sees Ko, Bun sees seven distinct individuals all walking in unison. Ho approaches Ko at a restaurant, asks questions while Bun watches. One of the individual personalities feeds lines to the one sitting with Ho. 

The film follows Bun and Ho as Bun uses his unusual gift to solve the case or die trying. Because, as Bun says, ""dying is better than living miserably, and I've been miserable for a while now.""

<blockquote><i>— Can you see her?
— Just trying.</i></blockquote>

This movie is so off-kilter! You could easily call it a comedy or a spoof of crime thrillers, but it's also a crime thriller. It effortlessly plays in and with the tropes, treating the audience as smart enough to be able to distinguish the difference. And by smartly playing in both Bun and Ho's perspectives, we piece together what is actual and what is visible only to Bun.

The Chinese title for the movie is literally Miraculous Detective, but a better translation is something like Master Sleuth. Unlike Sherlock Holmes, Bun works from an emotional reasoning and subjective space. Like Holmes, he derives facts from improbable intuitions and connections. The film never diagnoses Bun as schizophrenic, but Bun is Beautiful Mind-ing throughout, so I can understand why reviews might assume that.

Most surprisingly, the intuitions Bun has made sense, and while we can't follow every step he takes, it comes together satisfyingly. Though Ho doesn't accept everything at face value, he still trusts Bun, having seen his track record. It's a refreshing dynamic from the believer/skeptic dichotomy that usually arises in these stories.

Cut to a radio station in Calcutta making a similar report of a sighting. All around the world, people are tracking this object and reporting it to the world via radio. An eerie hum fills the National Mall in DC as the object, a glowing saucer, makes a landing. The people present run away in terror as it touches down. The military assembles in preparation, cordoning off the ship. After two hours, a plank emerges from the side of the saucer. The dome pulls apart, and a humanoid alien exits the saucer.

<blockquote><i>We have come to visit you in peace and with goodwill.</i></blockquote>

Still, the army men hold close to their weapons, and closer still as the alien pulls a small device out of its outfit. When the alien shakes the device, a nervous officer shoots and injures the alien. A thick robot emerges from the ship, sending the onlookers fleeing. The robot opens its visor, and a glowing beam emits as it disintegrates all of the weapons and tanks. The alien, Klaatu, stands up and stops the robot, Gort. Klaatu picks up the remnants of what he held — a gift for the President to study life on other planets. 

<blockquote><i>Klaatu barada nikto!</i></blockquote>

The military takes Klaatu to the hospital, where the President's Secretary comes to visit him. Klaatu requests a representative from every nation on Earth, so that he can relay an important message to them. The Secretary assures him that it would be difficult, considering the nations don't all, um, get along. Klaatu doesn't care about Earth's petty squabbles and will not show favoritism to any country or group, intentional or otherwise. So, they lock Klaatu away, insisting he doesn't interact with the world.

So, Klaatu escapes, putting the military into panic, and that panic transmits across the world. What message does Klaatu bring? Can the people of Earth put aside their childish conflicts to receive it?

The film uses Klaatu as a stand-in for the return of Christ. That is, if Jesus were to return to the Earth as it is, would Earth hear him out? Lucky for Klaatu, he only tried during the Cold War. Imagine what would have happened to him if he had tried to land in Washington Mall today.

The film does a tremendous job of building atmosphere, putting us in the heightened alert state that the other Earthlings are in just as the credits stop rolling. Through radio transmission, we see how messages reach everyone, visiting various living rooms, street corners, and other places where people gather. Through this, we gain a sense of the scale and can connect with human faces to empathize.

The film's biggest flaw is its blatant pro-USA and Christian bias — Klaatu, disguised as ""Mr. Carpenter,"" gets a tour of the Washington Mall and immediately believes Lincoln was a great man. Also, it's hella pro-police state.

Still, the structure and pacing have that icy 50s sci-fi feel that I dig. After watching a trillion terrible 50s sci-fi movies, it's reassuring that I still find the good ones so captivating.

<b>*** Stray Thoughts ***</b>
* Love the opening credits over the space matte paintings.
* The score is incredible! Bernard Herrmann has to be an influence on Danny Elfman, among others.
* I love how it goes to so many locations to show people listening to the radio — it globalizes the community.
* I don't think I've seen Frances Bavier in anything other than Andy Griffith. 
* The lighting and set design on the ship are so sick. I love how they only play score in there, no foley.
* Tom is the worst!
* Thanks to <a href=""https://letterboxd.com/owensp/"">Owen</a> for the DVD! The DVD menu is fantastic.

<blockquote><i> In this world of guns and knives, Tang Lung is respected wherever he goes.</i></blockquote>Tang Lung stands in a Roman airport. All the white people gawk at him. His stomach rumbles. He steps away and sits down in a restaurant. Unfortunately, the menu is all in English. He asks for 雞蛋 (eggs, which are on the menu), but the waitress doesn't understand him. So, he points to a random item and hopes for the best. It turns out to be a soup dinner for six. He tries to act like it was intentional and eats all of them. Finally, he finds the person who brought him here, Chen Ching-hua. He doesn't know exactly what she needs help with, but he assures her that he can help. She isn't confident.

On the drive, Chen explains how her father died, leaving her a restaurant. Her uncle, Wang, and others have helped her keep things going. That is, until a crime syndicate boss makes an unrefusable offer to buy the restaurant property. So, when Chen refuses, the boss puts men outside the restaurant to stand there all day and scare away customers. Meanwhile, Tang continues to have to go to the bathroom.

The film follows Chen and Tang as Chen attempts to assist Tang in navigating Rome, while Tang helps Chen with her gangster-related issues.

The humor isn't uproarious, but it is cute. Lee doesn't quite have the onscreen charisma of, say, Jackie Chan. But once Lee fights, the charisma comes out. Also, he's a delight to watch as he negotiates the cultural differences of Rome. 

The fight scenes are pretty bare-bones, but by focusing on authentic martial arts, the choreography is excellent, conveying a great deal of storytelling through movement, composition, and character beats. The kick sound effects are probably the best I've heard. I love the mix of hard-hitting effects and cartoonish boings.

This movie would rip on the big screen, especially that final fight with Chuck Norris.

I'm sure I've seen this restaurant in another martial arts movie, but it could just be a template used for fight scenes.","torrent, cmc, cmc2018, criterion, chopsocky, beck",2025-09-19

The early morning sky is cornflower and candy floss. A window is shattered at the school, with blood lining the broken edges. Inside, a trail of blood leads to a dying deer in the cafeteria. Later, kids arrive, and teachers lead the kids out as the police put the deer out of its misery. Allison watches through the door window as one officer holds the deer down and the other stomps on its head.

Cut to Zach and Josh looking at their yearbook, a signal-scrambled premium channel on the television. This must be the 90s. Zach finds the girls in his grade cute, but Josh finds something wrong with each of them. They can agree on one girl: Allison. They head out on their bikes through the fog-dappled small town. At the convenience store, they run into Daryl and Charlie. Daryl freaks out when he finds dried squid in the store, convinced no one eats it, so they buy it and dare each other to eat it. And, of course, they act like it's the grossest thing they've put in their mouths (well, except Josh, who seems to love being contrarian).

Now that we've established that these teenage boys all suck tremendous ass, we watch them continue to be asshats. Zach and Josh get invited to Allison's birthday. Daryl starts hanging out with them. Josh's brother shipped off to the Marines, but his stuff is still in the house, tickling Daryl's curiosity. Josh shows off his brother's katana. Daryl secretly steals some weed from Josh's brother, too. They fill milk cartons with water and slash through them. Daryl rolls one up and smokes it, igniting a fight between Josh and Daryl.

What happens next will fuck up their lives.

The film seems to be going for a blend of <i>Stand by Me</i> with that nostalgia-bent eye of <i>Stranger Things</i> (or something). It's tough to stick with them when I just want them to get what they deserve.

The movie sort of devolves into vibes with dream sequences, surreal experiences, and syrupy synths. Not necessarily complaining, but it feels like a separate movie starts up.

The movie kicks back into gear for the third act to give us some necessary tension. Still, it doesn't seem to add up to much in the end.


<b>*** Stray Thoughts ***</b>
* Daryl is supposed to be obnoxious but funny. He's just obnoxious.
* Zach's mom is cool. Like, whose mom is that cool?
* The movie does a good job of making the katana feel dangerous. 
* No boys in 1996 were touching each other's cheeks as much as Josh and Zach do each other.
* Also, no Macarena anywhere?

In the future year of 1994, people run down the steets to the Worldvision Song Festival, where they watch the dazzling BIM, led by Pandi and Dandi, perform ""Hey, Hey, Hey, BIM's on the Way."" Behind the scenes, BIM's agent, Mr. Boogalow, sweet-talks the show producers about BIM being the next big stars. The audience loves it. Next up, Alphie and Bibi, from Moosejaw, perform ""Love, the Universal Melody."" The audience complains about their dull ballad, but one girl sits in rapturous tears. Slowly, the audience dies down and warms to their performance. Unnerved, Mr. Boogalow's entourage gives the producer a red tape to play, which drowns out Alphie and Bibi's song with dissonant synth noises, re-angering the audience.

So, BIM wins the competition. Mr. Boogalow gives several interviews to different reporters, who congratulate him, except for an independent reporter, who speculates that Boogalow rigged the competition. Mr. Boogalow threatens the reporter's job to silence him. Then, Boogalow and his entourage go to an afterparty. Bibi also promised she would go, bringing a reluctant Alphie along with her.  There, Boogalow offers them a goblet of champagne. Alphie refuses, but Bibi accepts and goes up to Boogalow's penthouse with Dandi, who gives her a drug and makes a move on her.

Boogalow agrees to sign Alphie and Bibi. Alphie refuses, but Bibi sees this as an opportunity. What will be the fallout?

The movie is a Biblical allegory, where Alphie and Bibi are God's chosen to bring a message of love to the devastated wasteland of 1994. Meanwhile, Mr. Boogalow is the antichrist, stifling love and giving people a BIM mark to show their allegiance. The mark is an equilateral triangle, whose degree measurements are 60 °, 60 °, 60 °. Dandi is the snake who tempts Bibi into the BIM lifestyle. 

And in case any of this isn't registering, Boogalow takes them down to hell, where Bibi tastes the apple. It seems the movie's message is, ""Hippies had some good ideas.""

This movie isn't good, but it's far from the garbage that some critics ascribe to it. It's so ridiculous that its cult status is well-earned.

I'm imagining a world where this became the underground cult phenomenon that Rocky Horror was, and what those midnight screenings would look like.


<b>*** Stray Thoughts ***</b>
* Wait, I think Tim and Eric's costumes in the Community episode ""App Development and Conditions"" came from this movie—specifically, Ashley, the guy who invents the BIM mark.
* George S. Clinton (not that George Clinton) translated the script from Hebrew to English. You know, the score for Mortal Kombat? Undercover Brother? Austin Powers?
* 1980 was a year of big swings! Altman's Popeye also came out this year.
* I didn't realize how unsubtle this movie would become.
* The scenes in hell are pretty wild.
* I love that BIM's office is obviously a mall.
* The Boogalow reggae song is uncalled for.
* ""USA, land of the free — is shooting up with energy, and every day she needs to take more… SPEED!"" This song sounds like the first draft for the 90s ""America's Funniest Home Videos"" theme song.
* The BIM mark is obligatory now! Is Boogalow both an agent and a ruler of the US?
* We get some gender fuckery!
* ""Now I'm comingggggg, coming for you!"" They couldn't think of a metaphor for sex, so it's just an image of couples in lingerie dancing on beds in various suggestive positions.
* The guy singing ""Child of Love"" has the singing voice of that old guy in church who would get solos.
* Mr. Topps is a helluvah pivot. He raptures them, I guess?

We open on a snowy, suburban home. A teen boy named Mark walks out with his dog and jumps on his riding mower. With a snowplow appended to the front, he goes on a joy ride as he shovels snow off the road. He runs into a for sale sign, which knocks him off the mower. Cut to another teen boy named John sneaking into a room and looking through all the drawers. In the bottom drawer, underneath layers of clothing, sits a copy of Gallery. He starts ripping off the pages like a maniac before finding the 1-900 section. Finally, we meet a third boy, named Todd, who throws off his headphones because, I guess, country is playing. Their mom is working a double shift, so the kids are left to their own devices.

Mark comes in, complaining about the mower to Todd, saying he had to ask the monk across the street to help him get the mower unstuck. Mark goes looking for John while Todd huffs and puffs like a cortisol-ridden teen. Mark finds John trying to look casual—the phone rings and Mark answers. A whispering voice says, ""You know who this is"" before hanging up. John asks if it's ""that man."" As night falls, John and Todd play cards, complaining about how ""slow"" Mark is. 

Mark drifts off to sleep, where he has a vision of himself in the basement, and a chainsaw chasing their cat and chopping it up. He awakes with a scream, now in his bed. Mark looks down and sees blood on his hands, and he knows his cat is dead. But when Todd checks his hands, he sees nothing. John goes downstairs to look for the cat and finds the bloodied chainsaw and pieces of the cat. He runs to grab Todd, forcing Mark to stay behind as he shows Todd the mess. But when they get downstairs, there is no chainsaw or cat bits.

What are these visions? What do they mean? If they are predictions, can the boys prevent them from happening?

This movie is as low-budget as they come — two brothers and their friend making a movie at their house on a videotape recorder. And for that, it's pretty ambitious. Only two people are ever on screen at a time, as one of them is typically holding the camera. Still, it features some dynamic cinematography, including shots taken with a homemade dolly of some sort. The sound design is blown out, but it creates some solid atmosphere. No one can act, but they've littered the house with homages to their influences, from H.G. Lewis to <i>Return of the Living Dead</i>. The gore is cheap but quite creative, still crafting some effective gross-out moments.

And you know what? It works. Yes, the script leaves a lot to be desired, but the central conceit is a fun arena for the filmmakers to explore. Their passion is infectious and made me root for this movie.","tubi, cmc, cmc2018, sov",2025-09-24

We begin, not in Manhattan, but in Egypt. An archeologist, George, catches a scorpion for his nine-year-old daughter, Susie. Emily, a journalist and George's wife, takes a picture of Susie in front of the Sphinx. A hole opens in the sand. Susie goes into a trance, her hand full of sand. Emily runs off to take photos, letting Susie catch a break. A mysterious woman with white eyes approaches Susie. She holds out her hand, and Susie puts some lire in the woman's hand, and the woman puts an amulet with a jeweled eye in Susie's hand.

George's team unearths a stone that George believes holds the answer to many mysteries, including the Tomb of Habnumenor. The locals believe that the tomb is cursed and regret having unearthed it, but one man volunteers to enter with him. They find a hidden passage, but fall through a trapdoor, sending the assistant down into a bed of spikes. George rolls away in time to evade the spikes. He sees a glowing blue orb on the wall, matching the image on the amulet the woman gave to Susie. It's blue light lasers that blind George.

Emily returns to find Susie holding the mysterious amulet. George, blind, miraculously stumbles out of the tomb. Back in New York, the family reunites with their younger son, Tommy, and the nanny, Jamie Lee. Things seem okay at first, but the amulet starts to have a strange effect on the family.

Fulci worked with producer Fabrizio De Angelis, who promised Fulci his largest budget to date. Along with screenwriter Dardano Sacchetti, they sought to craft a horror story without the Gothic ethos of traditional horror. However, when De Angelis cut their budget by three-quarters, many of the special effects planned could not be realized, resulting in a film that left De Angelis alone satisfied.

That isn't to say the film is a total failure. The opening stuff in Egypt is quite fun, albeit no real departure from traditional horror. It's wild that the Egypt stuff was added after the fact just to give the film an ""international feel."" Instead, the film is just slow and relatively uneventful after the Egypt scenes. Still, Fulci and crew create an uneasy atmosphere that gives way to a few eerie moments.

<b>*** SPOILERS FOR PATHER PANCHALI ARE INEVITABLE ***</b>

<blockquote><i>One can't be happy without a family of one's own.</i></blockquote>

At the end of <i>Pather Panchali</i>, Apu's sister, Durga, has passed away, so his father, Harihar, and mother, Sarbajaya, pack up to leave their ancestral village in Bengal, moving to Varanasi. This film takes place in 1920. Boats sail up and down the Ganges, which runs alongside the city. People cover the ghats leading down to the river, bathing and paying homage to Vishwanath. Among them is Harihar, who is now a priest. He travels home to find Sarbajaya mopping the floor, worried about Apu wandering the big city.

We meet Apu, friends chasing him through city alleyways. Later, we find him watching his father officiating at the Ganges. Apu wanders off with a pinwheel toy, passing another priest, Kalicharan Banerjee, preaching. He sees a man swinging heavy weights around and watches with curiosity. Back home, Apu's mother tells Apu to ask the man upstairs, Nanda-baba, for two matches. Apu spies on Nanda-babu briefly, seeing him pull out a bottle of alcohol. When Apu asks for the matches, Nanda-babu tells Apu that the bottle is for his medicine. He gives Apu a box of matches, saying there is no need to replace them.

Back at the Ganges, Kalicharan approaches Harihar, looking for a place to have tea. Kalicharan is starving himself, saving up his earnings from the priesthood to purchase a bride from a decent family.  Cut to the city celebrating Dussehra. Sarbajaya suggests that Harihar take Apu to see the Ramlila performance, but Harihar is sick and goes to bed. Sarbajaya wants to call a doctor, but Harihar insists they use some of his herbal medicine. Apu walks in to find his sick father lying in bed. Apu's friend, Shambhu, calls from the other room — Shambhu is Hindustani and teaching Apu English. Apu's father tells him to play.

The next day, Harihar goes out to the ghats, despite being sick. He collapses on the steps. The film follows the aftermath of Harihar's illness and the dynamic it creates between Apu and his mother.

This film came to be through the success of <i>Pather Panchali</i>. Like <i>Pather Panchali</i>, this film is based on Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay's novel of the same name, drawing from the end of Pather Panchali and the first half of Aparajito. However, in this instance, Sataylit Ray took more artistic license with his storytelling, deviating from the novel to convey a more complex dynamic between Apu and Sarbajaya.

The film explores how Western individualization affects the family and one's perspective on it. Apu excels in school and is offered a scholarship opportunity. But to do so, he must leave his mother behind. She reluctantly agrees, but the strain it puts on their relationship never goes away. Nearly all the hardships the family faces are in some way the result of British exploitation.

The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous. Subrata Mitra makes excellent use of the narrow city streets, the ghats at the Ganges, and other architectural elements to help frame the characters. Mitra pioneered bounce lighting with this movie, recreating the large-scale diffusion of studio lighting in location shooting.

<b>*** MOMENTS I LIKED ***</b>
* The scene with Kalicharan and Harihar standing in the rain.
* The juxtaposition of Harihar and the birds flying off.
* The passage of time with the flowers growing.
* The montage of Apu educating himself and growing into a young adult.

After releasing an incredible first picture, Satyajit Ray follows it up with a film that technically exceeds its predecessor in nearly every way. This film is a beautiful document of a specific era of India's history, made by one of India's greatest directors.","criterion channel, criterion, asiancinemachallenge2023, asiancc2023, asiancc2023week18, golden lion, 1001 movies, ibn 100, coming-of-age",2025-09-26

A typhoon approaches the Japanese mainland. A ship is caught in the middle, pushed into a reef, and runs aground on Biru, an uninhabited island used for atomic tests. When the storm clears, a rescue party comes and finds four sailors on the beach, alive. At the National Synthesis Nucleus Center, scientists perform studies on the men and determine that they suffered no radiation damage from the highly radioactive island. One sailor suggests that the juice the natives served the sailors protected them. 

The country of Rolisica co-sponsors a joint expedition to Biru. There, they discover a previously unseen jungle, caves filled with giant mold mutations, and two women, each only 1 foot tall, whose songs deter vampire plants. The women, called Shobijin, give a message to the expedition team: that they no longer wish for the military to test atomic bombs on their island. The expedition hides this information on their return. And one of the expedition members abducts the Shobijin.

So, the island natives call upon the goddess Mothra to save them.

The film follows the rubric set out by <i>King Kong</i> (exotic island, evil moron abducting native residents) and <i>Godzilla</i> (nuclear waste is harmful, everyday people facing consequences of evil moron's choices). The result is a film that smartly balances human conflict and wide-scale destruction. This film also marks Honda's transition to more family-oriented Kaiju films, attempting to follow a more Disney-like approach. Eventually, the Toho approach would veer too far in this direction, creating obnoxious kids as our leads.

With the Shobijin, the film, intentionally or otherwise, touches on some sexist politics that make this quite progressive for its time. These women perform against their will, obviously dispondent, but the people who control them convince themselves that the women like what they're doing, mistaking submission for interest. How often have women in performance spaces dealt with these dichotomies, selling an image of pleasure and leisure while having little of either in their personal lives? And of course, the most common of sex pest refrains, ""She seemed to be enjoying it.""

Rolisica is a stand-in for the United States, a capitalist superpower more concerned with exploitation than the consequences of its actions. Biru could easily be a stand-in for Bikini Atoll, also a target of US nuclear testing. And, as you know, Hiroshima and Nagasaki are always in the background whenever nuclear destruction is in the conversation.

The real star of the show, however, is the production design. The use of color and investment in creative fauna on the island contrasts beautifully with the dreary nature of Kaiju up to this point. Even Mothra herself has a more colorful appearance once she changes form. Reading about the production, it's a wonder the filmmakers managed to achieve as much as they did, given the budget constraints they faced. But perhaps that constraint is part of what makes this film work.

I wish I had found a non-English dub. The offensive accents are a lot to deal with. Also, I hate the island native blackface.

I'm always happy to see Takashi Shimura.","tubi, asiancc2023, asiancinemachallenge2023, asiancc2023week19, kaiju, nature attacks",2025-09-28

On a snowy February morning, Kat dreams about her parents being involved in an auto accident. Kat awakens from this dream in her dormitory bed at Bramford Academy. Rose has a secret that she's keeping from everyone except Lizzie. Lizzie insists Rose has to tell her boyfriend, Rick, that she is pregnant.

Kat's parents don't arrive to pick her up. Rose told her parents to pick her up on Friday. So, Mr. Gordon, the headmaster, asks Rose to look after Kat until they can contact Kat's parents. Kat has a problem where she seems to stop and glaze over, missing what people are saying to her.

Joan gets off a bus at the station. She goes to the bathroom, where she rips off the bracelet from the asylum. She looks at a map and decides to go to Portsmith, on the other side of Bramford. At the station, a man named Bill approaches, asking if she's okay and offering her a lift with him and his wife, Linda.

How will these stories converge? Was Kat's dream a premonition? Will Rose keep the baby? Who is Joan?

<blockquote><i>It's strange, people think you look for [God] in some book, or in a church. A statue, maybe even a candle flame. But that's not how it works for me. I look for him in the unlikely things that happen—little coincidences.</i></blockquote>

The film alternates its focus between Kat, Rose, and Joan, occasionally revisiting events from the others' perspectives. The result is a solid building up of dread. The film fills the space with seemingly disparate images, conveying everything that is going to happen without explicitly stating it. 

The film's biggest weakness is its length, a complaint I also have about his other movies I've seen. There's a difference between drawing out suspense and delaying the inevitable. We could cut quite a few multiple-perspective scenes and pep up the pacing.

Perkins crafts a meditation on grief disguised as a horror movie — a recurring trope that haunts the genre to this day. Here, he gets away with it by not letting the grief overtake the horror.

* Kiernan Shipka plays a haunted girl who says all the quirked-up nonsense you tend to hear haunted girls saying. She's good at keeping her eyes open for a long time!
* Lucy Boynton is solid, but she's pretty much the straight man here.
* Emma Roberts is great. Sorry, no spoilers!
* James Remar is the horniest daddy.
* Lauren Holly gives a Lynchian performance. Such a shame she never got the chance to work with him.


<b>*** SPOILER TALK ***</b>
The film's meditation on grief is the loss of God. Through the entity that possessed her, Kat had a meaning and purpose. When they exorcise it out of her, she loses that sense of belonging. She spends years fighting and killing to get out of the asylum where they put her, desperate to find the entity again. When Bill gives his speech about little coincidences, Kat cannot help but see this as a sign that the entity is waiting for her. But, as many of us know, when we've already lost faith, we cannot force its return. We can pretend, but it isn't the same.

It begins with a doting daughter, Cathy Dollanganger, who idolizes her mother, Corrine. For their father's 36th birthday, Cathy and her siblings — her brother, Chris, and the 5-year-old twins, Cory and Carrie — throw a humble but festive party. When they hear someone at the door, they prepare to greet him, but instead, see two police officers, who inform them that their father has died. Corrine sells everything to care for the family, forcing them to move in with Corrine's parents, the Foxworths, who disowned Corrine years ago. Corrine intends, in her father Malcolm's final years, to win back her father's love, so that the family may inherit his wealth.

They travel to Foxworth Hall, a looming Victorian mansion overlooking an immaculately manicured lawn. In the vestibule, lined with statues and paintings, stands Corrine's mother, Olivia, holding a Bible. The Dollangangers follow Oliva up the stairs to a bedroom with two beds. Although the twins usually sleep together, Olivia insists that the boys, Chris and Cory, sleep in one bed, while Cathy and Carrie sleep in another. Oliva sets up strict rules, including keeping the children locked in the room. Corrine beseeches her children to obey Olivia, no matter what the circumstances.

Olivia, alone with the children, reveals why they disowned Corrine: their father was their mother's half-uncle. Also, Corrin's father, Malcolm, does not know that the children exist, so as long as he is alive, Olivia will do anything possible to hide the shame of grandchildren born of incest. And to show the children how they dole out punishment in this house, Olivia bullwhips Corrine and forces Corrine to show them the seventeen lashes, one for each year she lived in sin.

The film follows the children as they figure out how to survive and possibly escape the house.

<blockquote><i>Remember, God sees everything. God will see whatever evil you do behind my back, and he will punish you for it.</i></blockquote>

The book is part of a series written for a young adult audience, but you can get away with a lot more in print than you can on screen. So, the producers went to great lengths to tame the source material. Even mid-production, writer and director Jeffrey Bloom had to handle multiple drastic changes to the script. At one point, Wes Craven was attached, having written a script. But the producers were horrified by the sex and violence, once again proving how Hollywood never understood Craven's career-long exploration of the family in crisis.

Still, despite the cutting, the remnants of the earlier film version are evident throughout. For example, a scene where Chris watches Cathy get in the bath still has him rubbing her back while she's in the tub. And, there's still a moment where Chris sees Cathy changing.  

As a result, the film isn't about much beyond child abuse and repression. Throughout, we get hints at the role of repression in childhood on growing minds—take something away without any explanation, and watch youth fixate on it. Add to that violent repercussions, and how do you think children will learn to respond to their problems?

That isn't to say the movie is terrible. Yes, you have to draw in some characterization on your own for the story's trajectory to make sense. But the end of the second act, leading into the third, sets up a tense, albeit silly, final act. And to be clear, I don't care about the cut salaciousness — I just wish this weren't so dang boring.

Megan calls for her mommy, screaming. Her mother, Karen, rushes into the room to discover that six-year-old Megan has seen a moth and begs her mom to kill it. Instead, Karen scoops it in her hand and releases it into the night. Outside, breathing and steps watch from across the street.

The next day is Megan's birthday. Karen hits traffic, party balloons filling her backseat, so she calls home on her car phone. Her seventeen-year-old daughter Julie picks up, who is at home setting up decorations for the party. The doorbell rings, and Julie answers. Karen hears through the phone the sound of Julie choking. Then bangs. Then screams. Megan will not hang up the phone, looking for another phone to call the police. But it's too late: the intruder murders Julie.

We watch Karen through moments of grief: the wake, looking at Julie's things, and spending time with Megan. She imagines every man she passes as the intruder. Detective Denillo reaches out to assure Karen that there is enough evidence to find and convict the intruder. He also gives her a card for a support group for grieving parents. There, she hears person after person talking about their child's killers getting reduced sentences, paroles, and walking free. 

Denillo catches the killer: a man named Robert Doob. Karen becomes obsessed with knowing his face. So, when lawyers get swapped and DNA evidence is not submitted, Doog walks away. Slowly, slowly, Karen decides she might need to take matters into her hands.

<blockquote><i>— Like it or not, he has rights.
— What about my daughter's rights?</i></blockquote>

This movie is pure exploitation painted with a '90s mid-budget sheen. The first SA scene is indulgent—they only give a few brief shots, but there's no ambiguity about what happens. The second one shows everything (yes, he SAs and kills again). The characters are coarse, particularly in their treatment of Karen. Doon is, as others have stated, cartoonishly evil, similar to Freeway but with none of the comedic undertones. The justice system is… appropriately represented as inept and petty. The result is a lot of unintentional laughs.

The most obvious comparison to another movie would be <i>Death Wish</i>, which is also about a parent getting revenge for the rape/murder of their daughter. Sally Field is entertaining because she knows how to play the role for maximum emotional impact. I can see why Roger Ebert hated this movie. If good films are empathy machines, then this movie is bad because it is an antipathy machine—it only reinforces biases and stirs conservative ire.

But the film does make one point that I think is salient—the police do not care about you. The police are not invested in helping to solve murders and SAs. If they were, there wouldn't be decades of backlogs of DNA evidence that is expiring while they cruise the streets for minorities to kill. I'm not saying that, therefore, you should become a vigilante. I'm just saying that the police weren't designed to solve these types of problems.

So, yes, I didn't mind watching this movie once I was able to put it in its appropriate box. It's not great, but it managed to manipulate me enough to root for it. Which might make it worse?

* I started watching the <i>Eye for an Eye</i> that PlutoTV linked to, and it took me a minute to realize that this <i>Eye for an Eye</i> is actually a documentary about Mark Stroman, who is on death row. I thought it was just really cheap, but then I looked up Mark Stroman on IMDb and didn't see the name associated with the 1996 movie starring Sally Field.
* Cynthia Rothrock doesn't appear until an hour in as the self-defense instructor, Tina. I don't think we see her face. Yes, I still recognized her, whatever that says about me.
* This movie features a cast of character actors. Keith David, Philip Baker Hall, Donal Logue, Armin Shimerman, Ross Bagley (Buckwheat from the 90s <i<Little Rascals</i> movie).
* Screenwriting partners and married couple Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver have a unique career. After doing oddball thrillers like this and <i>The Hand that Rocks the Cradle</i>, they write <i>Rise of the Planet of the Apes</i> and get bigger opportunities from there, including <i>Jurassic World</i>, the 2020 <i>Mulan</i> remake, and all the <i>Avatars</i> from <i>The Way of Water</i> on.
* Karen makes sandwiches for Mack, Megan, and Julie, all while helping Julie with her French.
* At work, Megan showcases a state-of-the-art TV-based media research library. On one TV is the O.J. trial.
* Why is there an ice sculpture at a six-year-old's birthday party? Because, ""You don't know these six-year-olds."" 
* Of course, she has an Aunt Flo. We watch her slip on a toy and hurt her hip. The filmmakers intend this scene to be comedic relief.
* Joe Mantegna is such a bad actor. He's reading off the ways they gathered DNA evidence from the crime scene as though he's reading off a to-do list. 
* Finally, a movie set in 1996 featuring the Macarena.
* To demonstrate just how evil Doody is, we see him pour hot coffee on a dog for funsies. He also swerves around in traffic just to cause chaos.

While out catching butterflies with Moon-oh and friends, Kim Yeong-geol stumbles across a woman by the river. When Yeong-geol injects a caught butterfly with a solution to kill it, the woman accosts Yeong-geol, and the two argue over the nobility of death. They share some Fanta that the woman brought with her, only for her to reveal that she had poisoned the Fanta. Though Yeong-geol survives the poisoning, the woman dies. Later, at the police station, Detective Park rules the woman's death a suicide and lets Yeong-geol go, giving him a necklace the woman wore, which features a jeweled butterfly.

Yeong-geol discovers that the poison gives him suicidal thoughts. On his way home, he encounters a mysterious older man selling a book about using willpower to prevent death. The older man keeps pestering Yeong-geol, stopping Yeong-geol from killing himself, to Yeong-geol's chagrin. In frustration, Yeong-geol tries to kill the man, first by stabbing him, then by burying him, and finally by setting him on fire. Through all of it, though the older man's body dies, his will still lives within him. Finally, Yeong-geol relents to learn about will, and the older man turns to ashes. Yeong-geol brings the ashes to the police to confess to murder, but Detective Park assures Yeong-geol that the ashes are just dirt and that he must have had a hallucination fueled by the poison.

So, Yeong-geol tries to live his life, going on a cave expedition with Moon-oh. In the cave, they find the skeleton of a woman. They decide to sell the skeleton. Moon-oh leaves the skeleton with Yeong-geol so that Moon-oh can speak with an expert, Professor Lee, who specializes in collecting old skeletons. While reassembling the skeleton, rain leaks through Yeong-geol's roof, bringing the skeleton back to life. The woman died 2000 years ago, fasting for 30 days per a shaman's instructions so that when she awakens, she will meet a good man. She must also eat a raw human liver in 10 days or she will die. Yeong-geol tries to find her a liver but is unable, so the woman decides to take Yeong-geol's instead. However, after spending 10 days together, she has fallen in love with him and spares his life, losing her own in the process.

Yes, all this happens in the first act of the movie. The rest of the movie's plot unfolds when Yeong-geol secures a job working for Professor Lee and meets the professor's daughter, Kyeong-mi, who also wears a jeweled butterfly necklace. What is her connection to the woman by the river? What does this fateful meeting mean for Yeong-geol? Will he find the will to live?

Like many East Asian films from this period, the film eludes a straightforward summary or genre classification. It has a folktale vibe, where Yeong-geol goes through a sequential series of events with no overarching plot. Think Don Quixote. Thematically, the movie explores death—those who crave it, those who avoid it. And I guess how women are the worst?

The cinematography is quite good — it's fluid, and the compositions effectively convey the power dynamics at play. The colors are pretty nice, thanks to smart and dramatic lighting that gives each scene an unworldly quality. It all has a playful quality that I find difficult to take seriously, but judging by the movie's wild tone shifts, I'm not sure how seriously I'm supposed to take it at times.

Overall, it's challenging to analyze the movie without discussing all its details, but I want to leave you with discoveries of your own. It's not that the film is difficult to understand— it just doesn't fit neatly into a box. Believe it or not, it all comes together in the end — the opening series of motifs recapitulated through the Kyeong-mi melodrama.

At New Hope Bio Apartment, a doorbell rings. Song-hee stops preparing food to find a detective outside her door. Song-hee lives in apartment 301. The detective wants to ask Song-hee about her neighbor in 302, Yoon-hee. She invites the detective in, offering him some of the fried chicken she prepared. The detective reveals that Yoon-hee is missing. Yoon-hee had come over for dinner the week prior, but Song-hee hadn't seen her since. The apartment security last saw Yoon-hee entering Song-hee's apartment, and hasn't seen her since. Song-hee explodes in anger at the implication that she abducted her. 

The detective then searches 302, finding it sparse, except for a desk and rows of books. While the detective searches, we see Yoon-hee against the wall at various points, but the detective doesn't see her. He finds and pockets Yoon-hee's anorexia medication and typed pages from Yoon-hee on sex. Song-hee enters to tell the detective that Yoon-hee is a writer and will be a great author one day. Yoon-hee would get phone calls that she never answered—the answering machine message was a man begging Yoon-hee to pick up.

The film cuts back to before Song-hee moved into 301, and we see Yoon-hee's routine. When overwhelmed, Yoon-hee would wander through the vacant 301. That is, until she sees Song-hee moving in. The reverberations of Song-hee's apartment renovations send Yoon-hee's books flying off the wall. The noise triggers traumatic flashbacks for Yoon-hee of being SA'd as a child. Song-hee, while decorating her place, remembers packing up her belongings after her divorce. He criticizes her weight gain. So, Song-hee goes on a diet while cooking delicious meals.

The film explores the relationships between Song-hee and Yoon-hee, as well as their respective connections to food and sex.

<blockquote><i>You must not enjoy sex. […] Not me. For me, sex is just like cooking. I can't control my desire for them.</i></blockquote>

When Song-hee sees Yoon-hee, she thinks about how thin Yoon-hee is. Yoon-hee thinks that Song-hee must be a slut. Song-hee loves both, while Yoon-hee finds both literally vomit-inducing. While trying to help Yoon-hee appreciate food, Yoon-hee writes dieting articles for women's magazines that Song-hee ends up reading and following.

Song-hee's apartment is hyper-modern and sleek, with red accents everywhere. She has a poster on the wall of herself from when she was younger and thinner, serving as a reminder of her motivation. The kitchen is designed to resemble a restaurant kitchen. Song-hee dresses in colorful and stylish contemporary fashion that, frankly, I would love to own—the fluffy yellow pullover with the retro flared sleeves is amazing. 

The sound design makes some fascinating choices — organic grinding and digital beeps create a sense of unease and paralysis. The 90s synth-heavy score fucking rules. It sounds like a sultry Mark Mothersbaugh score.

The cinematography is slick, featuring numerous rapid dollies that capture multiple angles without coverage. Shot in Academy ratio, each frame feels tight and carefully composed. The food preparation is beautifully shot, but if you don't eat meat, the meat preparation (such as decapitating and deboning) can be a bit nauseating. That nausea-inducing quality is likely intentional, although part of it is the greenish hue that Fujifilm has.

My biggest complaint is the pacing of the story — it becomes clear relatively early on the direction it is taking and loses a fair bit of steam on some of the flashbacks. Also, how many times do we need to see Song-hee try to feed Yoon-hee and Yoon-hee throwing up?

Still, this film is a sharp encapsulation of the nightmare of disordered eating.","worldscinema.org, hooptober, hooptober12, edited by women, written by women, cannibal",2025-10-02

El Santo is a masked luchador and hero to the Mexican people. We open on one of his real-life wrestling matches, with him fighting against a tag team. After the opening credits, we see a crowd carrying him into the ring, and people line up to get his autograph. The camera moves inside the ring, providing a closer perspective on the match. The challenger against El Santo is Black Shadow (Sombras). In the crowd is El Santo's biggest fan, Lt. Sanmartin.

After about 10 minutes of wrestling, Detectives Rodriguez and Isabel pull Sanmartin away to the police station to speak with Gloria Sandoval, the daughter of Professor Sandoval. The professor is missing after a stint in Haiti. He just finished a book about zombies. Sanmartin is a former student of the professor and a true believer in zombies. The police take the case! They look through the professor's study but find no clues. On their way out, they meet the professor's brother and Gloria's tío, Genaro. A mining accident left Genaro blind, and Rogelio, Genaro's nurse, cares for him. The police hide their identities from Genaro and Rogelio, stating they are medical students. 

Cut to the outside of Plateros Jewelry Store, where three strongmen sit in a car. They receive a radio broadcast to break in through the back door. In a stilted manner, the men amble to the back alley and break in. An alarm sounds at a private security office, and the men jump into their car to rush to the store. The men breaking in use wands that ignite like torches to break into a vault. The owner shoots one of the men repeatedly, but the man does not falter, knocking the owner out. The private security arrives on the site as the zombified men amble out. The security shoots them repeatedly to no avail.

How will the police stop an unstoppable force? Who is this masked villain who controls the zombies? Looks like they'll need to call on the assistance of their friend Santo, who moonlights as a superhero. 

By this point, El Santo's comic book series had already been going for nine years. He reluctantly entered the film world, unsure if they would be profitable. By taking pulp plots and plugging Santo in, the Santo series was able to churn out a ton of innocuous movies.

The wrestling matches seldom have anything to do with the plot. The matches seem to exist in case anyone coming to the movie thinks, ""I thought Santo was a wrestler. Where's the wrestling?"" They also serve as filler, as the pulp plots are usually too basic to fill a full-length movie runtime. This one also has a burlesque number somewhere in the middle. You know, a little something for the bored dads in the audience.

I've seen several Santo and Santo-adjacent movies at this point. Without the constant prattling of the MST3K crew, I can actually follow the vague plot of this one. It helps that this is the first movie where Santo officially stars, so the movie makes an effort to introduce the characters to the audience. It's still quite boring and cheap, but I understand its appeal, especially considering the time it was released.

<blockquote><i>This old yellow earth, it lets you tread upon it and plough it up. Are you willing to do it? You don't respect it...</i></blockquote>

<b>Early Spring, 1939</b>
In the vast expanse between Yan'an and Shaanxi, along the sparse Qinling Mountains, walks Gu Qing, a soldier from the CCP Eighth Route Army, sent out to collect local folk songs. In the distance, he hears a peasant folk song about the toils of working the land. He sees a wedding procession, with musicians performing around a bridal sedan. It arrives in a small village, where they quickly usher the bride, her head draped in red fabric, to the altar to marry a much older man. Gu Qing enters the village, making his intentions known to the people. He meets the 13-year-old bride and shares food with the wedding party, which includes plates of wooden fish meant to give the feeling of having plenty when they have little.

At dusk, we meet Cui Qiao at the banks of the Yellow River, singing a song about the complex life of women, whose families forcibly marry them off. The moment has a musical quality as the accompanying score grows lush. She carries buckets of water up the hill, passing her younger brother, Hanhan, who is still out tending the sheep, waiting for her return so they can go home together. Gu Qing travels to the next village and asks to live with a poor family, as he has heard that people experiencing poverty carry the local songs. Therefore, the people place him with Cui Qiao's family.

Gu Qing watches as Cui Qiao tends to the household chores. Talking with her father, he changes the words to one of the songs he's heard to communicate that, in the South where he's from, women choose their own husbands and do so when they are older than 13 or 14. The father finds the idea useless and rebukes Gu Qing's suggestion that his village must change. But Cui Qiao listens intently while continuing her work. She introduces herself and her brother. Through song, we learn that her mother has passed.

The film follows these characters through a season as Gu Qing befriends the children and Cui Qiao grows restless with the prospect of a life different than the only one she's known.

<blockquote><i>— There are hundreds and thousands of Shaanbei folksongs. Tell me, how can you know them all and remember them?
— When life becomes hard, you remember them. Collecting our bitter songs—what's the use?
— We collect the folksongs and put new words to them. We give them to our soldiers, boys and girls of Cui Qiao's age, to sing. To let people know how our suffering people are living in fear, how wives are being beaten, and why workers and farmers are starting a revolution. The Eighth Route Army hears these songs as they cross the Yellow River and march east, and fight the enemy and struggle against the rich without fear.</i></blockquote>

With this movie, directors Chen Kaige and Zhang Yimou revolutionized the filmmaking process in China. They, along with a handful of other filmmakers, became known as the Fifth Generation. These filmmakers went through the Beijing Film Academy—the first generation to do so after the BFA had been closed for years during the Cultural Revolution. Through that school, they were encouraged to experiment with style, which led to innovative methods of visual storytelling and political allegory—a significant break from the social realism model adopted after the Communist victory of 1949.

The film explores how Chinese cultural identities persisted across movements. That, despite the CCP's headquarters in the Shaanxi region, feudal customs continued to exist. Zhang Yimou employs minimal camera movement as a visual technique to convey the long stillness in culture. Yimou's love of color also shines through in the ochre tones of the Chinese landscape and the persistence of red, particularly in the young women who are forced to marry and denied any personal agency.

Each character receives their own musical theme, and each theme has distinct sonic qualities that combine folk song with specific instrumentation. In this way, the film conveys to us the disparate perspectives of these characters, honoring each, even when the other doesn't understand it. As a result, the audience finds a deep empathy for each of them. That said, Cui Qiao's story was the most moving for me.

<blockquote><i>In this ancient place, the melodies of 信天游（xintianyou）drift the year round.</i></blockquote>

This film elided government censorship through ambiguity, not criticizing the Communist Party while still highlighting its failures to uplift the peasant class it claimed to support. Still, the film faced harsh criticism within China, but garnered international recognition for the Fifth Generation. This recognition paved the way for films like <a href=""https://boxd.it/a8hOEr""><i>Raise the Red Lantern</i></a> and <i>Farewell My Concubine</i> to reach global audiences with visually stunning storytelling.

Once the sheen of Fifth Generation filmmakers wore off, their influence did not seem to have a lasting impact on Chinese filmmaking. However, their reputation persists worldwide, and their films remain among the most celebrated to emerge from China.

Criterion is finally giving attention to Fifth Generation films, so hopefully, they will add this movie to the collection soon.","worldscinema.org, asiancinemachallenge2023, asiancc2023, asiancc2023week20, fifth generation chinese, golden horse, chinese dissident cinema, solidarity",2025-10-03

A garbage collector grabs a can and brings it to the river to dump it into his trash gondola. Only in Venice, am I right? A shadowy figure jumps over a banister, through the trees, fleeing a hotel room where François Filiba lay out cold. The doorbell buzzes continuously as two Italian sex workers stand outside the door. François comes to and pulls himself up. His apartment is in disarray. He calls to report a robbery, and the news spreads quickly through the building.

The camera flies across the way and into another apartment. On the porch, a baron smokes, and a waiter comes to take his order as a countess rides up on a gondola. The waiter notices a leaf stuck to the baron's coat and pulls it off. The countess arrives in a fuss over the princes, counts, dukes, and kings she's avoided and greeted. She receives a call in the baron's room, supposedly from a Duchess. But on the other end, we see a woman telling her to come home through the back door.

François speaks to the police inspector about how he came to let a man in who proceeded to rob him—something about doctors and tonsils. Word makes it up to the baron and the duchess. When the waiter leaves, the duchess accuses the baron of being the thief. He accepts, unflinching, while also accusing the duchess of being a thief, for he had François's wallet until the duchess pilfered it from him. The two realize they love one another and confess their true identities: the baron is master thief Gaston Monescu, and the duchess is a pickpocket named Lily.

The film jumps years and locations to Paris to introduce us to the perfume manufacturer Colet and Co. Why? Because Gaston and Lily have a plot to steal from it.

The film is whip-smart and wastes little time. It's full of little oddball jokes and bits of social satire. I love the dude who quotes Trotsky at Colet for buying an expensive handbag. As a pre-code film, the movie presents scenes that imply Gaston and Lily are having sex and includes other suggestive innuendos. It's nice to see actual chemistry in a 100-year-old movie. 

The film briefly touches on the woes of the Great Depression through factory worker salaries, but relishes in highlighting the working class, who often fill the edges, a theme usually overlooked in screwball comedies. No one is an angel —  Gaston and Lily get to luxuriate in each other's lawless habits.

<blockquote><i>You have to be in the social register to keep out of jail. But when a man starts at the bottom and works his way up, a self-made crook, then you say, ""Call the police. Put him behind bars. Lock him up.""</i></blockquote>The sets are immaculate Art Deco. The gowns are numerous and elegant—one gown looks so sparkling that it almost appears blue in this monochrome film. The performances are good, Miriam Hopkins is hysterical, but Kay Francis steals every scene she's in.

The Ghost Festival occurs on the 15th night of the seventh month on the lunar calendar. The realm of the living becomes open to Heaven and Hell, and ghosts roam the Earth. On this night, the howls and cackles of the dead fill the dark streets as they eat the food left out for them. Chun Sing trains in the courtyard when a ghostly figure descends on him. The figure is his deceased father, calling on his son to get revenge on his father's murderer, Kam Tai Fu, who resides in Yellow Dragon Town. Wasting no time, Chun Sing tells his mother of his experience before leaving for Yellow Dragon. His mother warns him that the town is haunted.

While traveling, Chung Sing comes across an agent of Kam Tai Fu and a wizard battling one another. The agent demands the wizard's book of magic and kills the wizard for it. But when the agent searches the wizard's body, he cannot find it and runs off. Chung Sing pulls the wizard's sword from the ground, intending to use it to dig a grave, but when he pulls, the handle comes off, and he finds the magic book inside the handle. A dark storm picks up, but Chun Sing finishes burying the man before carrying on to a nearby inn for the night.

Meanwhile, Kam Tai Fu is participating in black magic rituals to become invincible. Chun Sing goes to confront Kam Tai Fu, giving him a list of demands: disclose his father's burial place, give away his ill-gotten earnings to charity, and kill himself. Things are looking up for Chun Sing until Kam Tai Fu uses black magic, forcing Chun Sing to retreat. Chun Sing consults the book of magic so he can learn how to defeat Kam Tai Fu and ends up recruiting some nearby hopping vampires as assassins to aid him.

The plot and structure are pretty chaotic, with two Kam Tai Fu confrontations back-to-back in the first act alone. I blinked, and there was a romance subplot 50 minutes in. Thank god Chun Sing's father had six fingers!

The film gets several jokes out of anachronisms—for example, when Chun Sing starts learning from the book of magic, a coffin sets up an antenna to capture Chun Sing's broadcast, seeking aid from the gods. Or, when Kam Tai Fu is in a particular bind, he burns some joss paper and summons Count Dracula to fight for him. A government agent joins the fight at one point, who is investigating the murders.

The ghost effects, while cheap, are effective. The use of neon green light to illuminate the ghosts works well to mask some of the makeup imperfections. Also, it isn't a supernatural kung fu movie if there aren't analog lightning effects, which always rule, even when they're this haphazard.

The Chinese title 陰忌, as best as I can tell, translates to something like ""Fear of the Nether World."" Google Translate says ""Yin Taboo"", which makes some sense since it takes place during Yin. I would love to hear from someone who actually speaks Cantonese.

Ahh, Twinkeltown at Christmastime. Lights lining the streets, couples fighting loud enough for the neighbors to hear. Detectives Jack and Jessie stop by a hot dog stand, despite just getting a call about a domestic disturbance. Jack and Jessie get into a tussle with a disputing couple, the wife holding a knife. Jack gets thrown around a bit, Jessie gets stabbed in the back, and the wife goes flying out the window.

Cut to Latin Jerry painting Bobby's teeth black and tying a red hachimaki around his head. Bobby sits down for an audition with Mr. Lawrence, in which Bobby plays Russian Roulette, like in <i>The Deer Hunter</i>. But when Bobby pulls the trigger, the gun actually goes off. Mr. Lawrence takes the camera off the stand to film Bobby's death in close-up. Latin Jerry goes out to recruit more actors, preying on a young woman named Summer, when Jack happens by. Latin Jerry is having soup, so Jack throws said soup in Latin Jerry's face, sending him off. Jack tells Sarah to go back home, giving her his card in case she needs him.

Jack follows a lead on the location of Janet, another Latin Jerry recruit, at a phone sex company. He goes in, makes some crass jokes, and finds a gallery of kinks in the backroom, including Janet tied up nude, being whipped. Jack releases her. He then goes to the police station to tell Sara to cover him while he takes Janet to the bus station. We then follow Jack around for a bit as he gets into all sorts of antics. But when Janet and Summer both end up dead, Jack gets down to business.

Mr. Tsui presents a manuscript to the boss of Bar Bridge Paper Mill for publication. According to Tsui, these are eight pages of Scholar Fong's unpublished memoirs. The boss takes a look, however, and determines they are forgeries. A worker comes to the boss's office to ask the boss a question and finds the window open and the boss dead. The Tien Lung Clan's White Flag Squad hunts down Tsui, finding him three days later. In the ensuing struggle, Tsui dies, and No. 3, the squad leader, retrieves the manuscript. The manuscript describes events that occurred eighteen years prior, in which two men digging for treasure in General Pingnam's tomb in Butterfly Valley were swarmed and murdered by a kaleidoscope of butterflies.

The Tien Lung clan leader assembles the Red and White Flag squads, detailing a letter he received from Shum Castle's leader asking for their help. They have discovered killer butterflies in their walls. The clan leader gives out orders and sends his right-hand man, Big-Eyed, to sneak into the castle and find out what happened. While traveling to Shum Castle, the clan leader encounters Green Shadow, who seems to know about Shum Castle and the Fong memoirs. So, she joins the clan leader, and they convene with the White Squad and enter Shum Castle. They find no signs of life, but they find Big-Eyed dead, his skin covered in lesions and, in his palm, a black butterfly.

Across the pond, they find a mute woman named Chee. Through context clues, however, Green Shadow finds a stairwell leading underground. There, they meet Master Shum and Scholar Fong. Master Shum invited all of them to tell them what happened at the castle. He tells the story of black butterflies overtaking the castle and killing many of its inhabitants. The clan leader hears the story, but cannot understand how someone like Big-Eyed could die so suddenly.

The film follows the crew as they investigate the situation. Are these truly butterfly attacks? Or is a more sinister plot afoot?

With <i>The Butterfly Murders</i>, Tsui Hark's debut, he revitalized the HK exploitation film, blending wuxia with giallo elements. Though HK found the film too oblique, the West celebrated, with British critic Tony Rayns calling it a ""Borgesian conundrum."" Borges is my favorite author, so hearing that amped my excitement to check this movie out. And the comparisons are apt! A manuscript that is possibly a forgery, stories within stories, and labyrinthine caves make the world feel unknowable and uncanny.

The blending of wuxia and giallo sounds odd in theory, but totally works here. The larger-than-life legends and fights have a wuxia feel, but the ridiculousness of butterfly murders screams giallo. Once we get into Shum Castle, the Gothic dread kicks up with talk of ghosts. Part of the blend's success is due to the rapid cuts, creating unusual juxtopositions that never get the viewer a firm grounding, so that scenes can shift or change without warning. The score also brilliantly combines Eastern musical motifs with Giallo instrumentation. The horror-pizzicato strings during some of the fights are wild.

Michelle Yim, who plays Green Shadow, brings an enormous amount of charisma to the screen. She makes everyone look manic and hasty with her chill demeanor and swift moves. 

This movie is brilliant! I was in awe throughout. It is unquestionably one of the most underrated gems I've seen. My Christmas wish is that a boutique shop like Vinegar Syndrome or Arrow pick this movie up.","tubi, hooptober, hooptober12, wuxia, giallo, chopsocky",2025-10-06

Outside of a French village is a lake the villagers call the Lake of the Damned. A young woman goes out to the lake, taking down a sign that warns her of death, and skinny dips. After several minutes, a Nazi zombie emerges and presumably kills her, though we don't see that on screen. In the village, Chanac threatens to go to the mayor if the young woman doesn't return by morning. When Chanac visits the mayor, he says they should wait and see if she shows up before calling the police.

The zombie attacks another villager and gives her a hickey, strawberry syrup leaking out of his mouth. Oh, wait, no, he's eating her, she's dead. The villagers discover her body and congregate around her as three men carry her to the mayor's office. The men are careful with her, yet ensure that her skirt lifts so the audience can get a peek at her panties. The mayor appears, lamenting that they cannot bury the woman until they determine the cause of death. 

A reporter, Katya Moore, arrives in town to investigate the ""weird lake."" The townspeople send her to the mayor, who knows the most about the town's history. She brings the disgruntled mayor a book, and the two discuss why the lake is ""damned."" The name comes from events that started 10 years ago, during WWII, when the Nazis occupied the village.

If I tell you any more, I'll be telling you the entire plot. The rest of the movie is that flashback, and the Nazi zombies killing more people.

The movie is shoddy work. Shots last way too long. The makeup is bare, and the prosthetics are always on the verge of falling off. No one emotes except for the occasional crying and/or screaming woman. The camera work is slipshod, mostly consisting of a handheld camera that shakily moves about a scene, as though surprised by each person who speaks up. The movie makes hilarious use of juxtoposition to reposition the lake's proximity to the village according to who gets killed next — in the first kill, it's quite a way away, and in the next, it's apparently right next to the village.

As others have noted, this movie went through three different directors. While Franco worked on it, the producers slashed the budget. Rollin came in as a favor to the producers. While Rollin worked on it, the producers wouldn't show him the script, as only one copy of the screenplay existed. When Rollin finally saw the script, he inquired about locations, and the producer would tear out the pages for that scene, and they would continue elsewhere. Everyone on set could tell it was a shit show, so they put in way less effort.

That said, these are professionals, so the movie isn't an incomprehensible mess. The film has a couple of moments, brief glimmers of a better movie that could have emerged from this project. For example, the Helena subplot is occasionally touching and really snaps the movie into focus. But those moments are buried under the film that is — the one that reflects the lack of care that extended from the producers downward.","plex, hooptober, hooptober12, zombies, video nasties",2025-10-07

After a photoshoot, swimsuit model Noemi speaks with model agency director Lillian about the whereabouts of Noemi's roommate and fellow model, Kathy. Lillian reluctantly brings Noemi to Howard Tucker, the sporting goods magnate, who tells Noemi that they intentionally stranded Kathy on a boat as part of a publicity stunt with fellow model Lorena. 

Kathy reports by radio that they believe they are in a position along the shipping line so that a passing ship will notice them. They cannot be sure, however, because fog envelops them. In the distance, they spot an old Spanish galleon floating toward them. They shoot off their flare, but the boat doesn't seem to react. As it gets closer, they can see no one on the galleon. The galleon collides with the motorboat. Kathy says screw this and boards the galleon while Lorena stays behind. Howard Tucker dispatches a helicopter to rescue the women, but it is unable to locate the motorboat.

For assistance in finding them, Howard and Lillian go to Professor Grüber, who is familiar with the weather in that area, and he assures them that it never gets foggy in that part of the ocean. When Lillian mentions a galleon, the professor assures her that the women will never return. He joins them, hoping for a chance to see this phantom ship himself.

Will Howard and team find Kathy and Lorena in time? What awaits them on the galleon?

Howard Tucker believes that money solves all his problems — it buys trust and confidence, allowing him to do what he wants. So, when Noemi, a staunch anti-capitalist, refuses his money, he resorts to more classical patriarchal modes of subjugation through kidnapping and SA. Similarly, Howard refuses to accept anything that isn't scientific, while ironically, the science professor is the first to believe that what they are experiencing isn't in their dimension of reality.

I like the galleon ghost designs. I haven't seen any of the other <i>Blind Dead</i> movies, so I'm not familiar with how the design compares to those films or if it's the same. I also like the spoopy vibes on the ship. I'm always a sucker for a haunted ship. The gore is whatever—if you care, you might be annoyed, but I found it good enough.

If you're not a horror fan, you might find this movie a little slow. While I don't think it necessarily makes the best use of its time, I believe the film builds effective tension through its patient unveiling. Still, this one is for the diehards.","amazon prime, hooptober, hooptober12, zombies",2025-10-08

<blockquote><i>There is protection from nearly everything, but there is no protection from mankind.</i></blockquote>

A space elevator ascends from Earth, with Earth's surface covered by a massive hurricane. Aboard the space elevator, a mother tells her small child to say goodbye to Earth. The space elevator arrives at its destination, a luxury spaceship called the Aniara, its interior closely resembling a higher-end cruise liner. An announcer wishes them a pleasant passage on their three-week journey to Mars. The Mimarobe runs off the elevator onto Aniara, where she joins flight captains on an elevator up to Mima, where she works.

The Mimarobe turns on a device that glows an orangish red, causing her to enter a trance-like state, during which she experiences her memories and emotions about the Earth as it once was: green and hospitable. In her experience, the Mimarobe walks through a forest, eats berries off a bush, and watches a waterfall. She then joins the Astronomer in her room, and they strap themselves down for the transition to zero-G.

An hour passes, and everything is routine for the voyage. Somewhere in space, a bit of space debris cascades through space. During a Mima demonstration, the debris collides with the Aniara, and the ship veers off-course. After some panic, the captain announces that the debris hit the ship's reactor, forcing them to jettison all the ship's fuel. As a result, no one can control the Aniara anymore. The plan is to pass a celestial body and use its gravity to reorient themselves in the correct direction. The captain expects it shouldn't take any longer than two years.

The film follows the voyage, the sudden importance of Mima as a means of mental escape, and the impact of all those memories on Mima's artificial intelligence. What no one except the Astronomer, The Mimarobe, and maybe the captains know is that they will likely never pass a celestial body.

I've seen enough movies to know that, when I'm about to watch Swedish Sci-Fi, it's going to be bleak as fuck.

Thematically, the film explores how humans handle not being in control of their fate. We have a version of the future where humanity did enough right to get life going on Mars, but not enough to save Earth. We're on a ship that no one can control, hoping to encounter a celestial body with no promises. They have the supplies to sustain life indefinitely on board the vessel. So all that's left is the mental and emotional impact.

Mima becomes an escape, but the impact of it consuming all the terrible memories is that it starts giving them back. The Mimarobe tries to shut things down to give Mima a rest, but the captain will have none of it, as the current system works. It starts to sound similar to the mentality that is contributing to the current ecological crisis—we ignore the warning signs and continue to do what has worked. It's not a perfect analogy, but it serves the story.

The Astronomer overseeing the trip is a mithatropist, willing to leave anyone on Earth to die as long as she is safe. The Mimarobe has a more humanist perspective, perhaps due to her Mima experiences. The film challenges The Mimarobe's perspective by highlighting the darkness that follows them as they try to build meaning from any unexpected turn.

While some facets of the movie reveal its smaller budget (notably anything shot in space), the production design is pitch-perfect, giving us something near-future yet recognizable. Grounding our visual surroundings further connects us to the humans experiencing this and the direction their lives take.

The film makes many jumps in time, giving us more glimpses of the future. It serves the intent of the film, so I wouldn't call it a flaw per se, but by painting with such broad strokes, it becomes challenging to draw out deeper characterizations of the people we follow. For me, prioritizing the sci-fi over the characters made me appreciate the movie a little less.

That isn't to say I didn't connect with any characters, or that any of the emotional beats weren't moving. I still quite enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to any sci-fi fans.","amazon prime, hooptober, hooptober12, written by women, directed by women, queer, cults",2025-10-09

An American social psychologist named Ben ascends the stairs of an apartment building in Berlin. He meets with a shut-in through her door. Her apartment is full of food, trash, and dirty dishes, and her only friends are those she meets online. She feels like the world is coming to an end, so why bother going out? Nature is attacking the cities for their reckless treatment of her. The way Ben sees it, she and people like her see everyone around them as dangerous people who will only confirm their persecution fantasies. Their fear leads to a need for truth and order, driving them to seek groups that exploit this need and create a false sense of belonging.

Ben receives a call from Max, calling him out to the site of a mass suicide. Nina, a detective on site, gives them a rundown of what happened. They find a note which states, among other things, ""Sacrifice is redemption. We return to the source so she may live."" Ben is convinced it's a cult, but Nina isn't so sure. Ben gets a text from his daughter, Mazzy, whose plane from San Diego just landed at Berlin Brandenburg Airport. He can't pick her up, so he tells her to take a train.

On the train, Mazzy receives help navigating from a boy named Martin. People carry signs reading, ""Sacrifice is Redemption."" The two get on, exchange numbers, and get off at the same stop. After a disastrous school year following her parents' divorce, Ben has brought Mazzie to Berlin to attend school for the semester. The following day, Martin meets up with Lotte, who is obviously the shut-in from the beginning of the movie, because Martin is so proud of her for getting the courage to come. They attend an environmental activism group led by a woman named Hilma.

We see where all this is going, right? 

The film explores individualism versus community. Community provides a common place of mutual care and shared resources. Individualism protects one from cults and other means in which groups will prey on people's thirst for community. How does one find a place in the world without being pulled down into its chaos?

Ben wrote a book about the science of loneliness, focusing on the effects of isolation on the human mind. Now, in Berlin, he is writing a book about the power of groupthink, aiming to balance his previous book by addressing the danger of like-minded people exchanging counter-societal theories. Nina seems to have a disconnect where, if someone believes in what they're doing, it's not a radical act because it gives their life meaning. Which probably means she's involved with the eco-terrorists, no?

I can't help but think of <i>First Reformed</i>, which also centered on an eco-terrorist group, but that movie made an effort to understand and pull us into that perspective. From the outset, this movie suggests that anyone who cares about the environment is probably in a cult.

Eric Bana is profoundly bad in this movie. He's never been a good actor, but the script calls for someone who can deliver sarcasm and warmth in a way he seems wholly incapable of mustering. Every line is flat, and every gesture feels rehearsed to the point of meaningless routine. 

Sadie Sink is good, making the most of a weak script. She and Jonas Dassler, who plays Martin, have decent chemistry! Like Bana, she also seems desperate for direction as she tries to make up the difference, which means her emotional scenes feel over-the-top.

Written and directed by Ridley Scott's daughter, Jordan Scott, the film wants to be a taught psychological thriller, but it doesn't want to do any of the work. Instead, it relies on genre cliches and predictable structures.

I don't care if a movie is predictable — it's not what happens, but how it happens that makes a movie entertaining. Here, it happens exactly like you expect it to, including the ""twist"" in the third act.","torrent, hooptober, hooptober12, cults, written by women, directed by women, edited by women",2025-10-09
2025-10-10,Valley of the Dolls,1967,https://boxd.it/bjLzgr,2.5,,"Anne Welles leaves New England for New York, leaving behind family and a suitor. She visits Bellamy and Bellows Law Offices to speak with Miss Steinberg about a secretary position at the firm for Mr. Henry Bellamy, a theatrical lawyer. Bellamy isn't convinced of Anne, so he tests her out by sending her to get signatures from Helen Lawson on some contracts. Little does Anne know that Lawson is a diva.

Once at the rehearsal hall to meet with Lawson, Anne makes the mistake of complimenting the girl singing in the other room, Neely O'Hara, whom Helen believes threatens her success. So, Anne demands that they cut Neely's number from the show and refuses to sign any contracts for Bellamy until he cuts Neely. Anne isn't sure she wants the job, so she goes back to Bellamy to report this. Instead, she runs into Bellamy's partner, Lyon Burke, whose handsomeness convinces Anne to stick around.

Bellamy, Burke, and Anne go down to the rehearsal hall and witness Neely losing her song, and Bellamy trying to get Neely to quit and save them money. Neely's friend, Jennifer, gives her some support in her dressing room. Burke does some quick thinking and lands Neely a performance for a cystic fibrosis telethon, which ends up being a huge success. They go to Tony Polar's nightclub to celebrate, where Burke negotiates a nightclub act for Neely.

The film follows Anne, Neely, and Jennifer as they find their respective success, only to have it all come crashing down.

The theme of the movie seems to be, ""showbiz is cruel."" Here, it drives promising young women into depression and addiction. The valley is Hollywood, full of promise, and the dolls are barbiturates, filling the space where success ought to be. Like Requiem for a Dream, the film has a cartoonish understanding of addiction and romance, resulting in a movie that leans heavily into melodrama, though it is not as fun.

The music numbers are fine. I don't really remember any of them. Despite their prominence in the movie, they feel closer to filler content.

I don't think this movie is as terrible as critics say, and it does have moments that made me chuckle. Barbara Parkins feels like a Kardashian prototype. Sharon Tate has an aura that is hard to separate from her tragic death. Patty Duke's soap opera delivery of every line is pretty iconic.

<blockquote><i>Ted Casablancas is not a f*g! And I'm the dame to prove it.</i></blockquote>

It took me about half the movie to get on its wavelength (that is, the wavelength that sees this as camp). While there are moments of fun, so many scenes in the movie just seem to drift in and out, rote and inconsequential. Still, I'm glad I saw it so that I can appreciate Beyond the Valley of the Dolls in comparison. ","torrent, written by women, edited by women, criterion",2025-10-09

On a rainy night in turn-of-the-century New York City, we enter a window where a shadow holds up a kitchen knife. But as we move further in, we see that it is a wax figure. In fact, this brownstone is full of them, all sculpted by Professor Henry Jarrod. Matthew Burke, Jarrod's business partner, enters from the rainy night, complaining about the slow business, which is all because Jarrod won't create more exploitative exhibits for the ""morbidly curious."" Burke wants out, and Jarrod has Sidney Wallace, a wealthy art critic, coming to visit, who may be interested in buying Burke out.

Later, Bruce, a friend of Jarrod, brings Wallace, and Jarrod gives them a tour of the exhibits. Wallace is enamored and wants to buy out Burke, but that will have to wait until he returns from a three-month series of excavations in Egypt. Burke overhears the whole exchange, as well as Jarrod talking to the wax figures as though they were alive. Burke isn't satisfied to wait three months, so he proposes setting the place ablaze and collecting the insurance. But Jarrod cannot bear the thought of seeing his friends destroyed. Still, Burke fights Jarrod and begins setting the exhibits on fire. He knocks Jarrod out and pours kerosene for the lamps over the rest of the exhibits and over Jarrod, leaving him to die in the fire.

Burke tells his fiancée, Cathy, about the incident, painting it as a tragic accident. No one found Jarrod after the fire, but Burke received the insurance money. Burke returns to his office to grab some of the cash when a man, dressed in black and with a scarred face, emerges and strangles Burke to death. When the coast is clear, the man ties a rope around Burke's neck and tosses him down the elevator shaft so that it appears like Burke committed suicide. The attacks continue when the scarred man murders Cathy, but Cathy's friend, Sue, walks in on the man arranging the scene and runs for her life to a friend's house.

The murderer steals Cathy's body from the morgue with the aid of two other shadowy figures. Sidney Wallace receives a letter from Jarrod, who is not only alive but, with the help of two assistants, is opening a new exhibition that caters to people's more macabre tastes. 

<blockquote><i>— It's a portrait in wax.
— Why should it seem so real?</i></blockquote>

From a technical perspective, the cinematography is tight, the pacing is ideal, and the use of color creates striking images throughout. The pink wax coursing through the chemistry tubes looks like Pepto-Bismol, which I find aesthetically pleasing, but I have an unusual relationship with the stuff. I guess it's in 3D, but nothing about the images suggests that, except for specific frames having the blurriness of using the 3D lenses.

Throughout the film, we see the morbidity of everyday people. Cathy is nonplussed about Burke's death. She and Sue joke about how violent men get with them and ""knowing when to duck."" The morticians make cracks about bodies moving due to embalming fluid, such as ""Leave it to a woman to try and get the last word in."" And, of course, Jarrod's wax museum becomes a massive hit only when he indulges in people's morbid curiosity by recreating famous deaths.

The fight and fire scene in the opening is so harrowing! Watching the wax figures melt is pretty nightmarish! It reminds me of the face-melting scene from <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>. There's a moment where Burke throws a sword at Jarrod, and the sword hits the camera! The actors are throwing each other into burning set pieces, tumbling about — it looks dangerous, frankly. But the result is wonderfully tense.

<b>*** Actor Talk ***</b>
* Carolyn Jones, who plays Cathy, talks like Harley Quinn. The actress played Morticia Addams on the Addams Family TV show!
* This film turned Vincent Price's career around. Before this, he played bit parts. This movie made him highly sought after for horror roles. 
* Young Charles Bronson plays Igor! He looks carved out of butter.

I love how, regardless of gender, folks are trying to get peeks at the wax figures' private parts.

If you've seen movies, this won't surprise you, but it's so well done that it's a joy to watch it all unfold. ","torrent, oh my horror, omh, omh2025, scorsese's 85 film, slasher, serial killer",2025-10-10

At dusk, a search party looks for missing persons Simon and Keri. Two dogs find a hole in the ground with a bell embedded in its lip. Down at the bottom, they find a pool of water surrounded by roots that drive into the water and drink from it. Their owner finds them in the woods, standing still and staring at one another. He takes them home and puts them in their pen in one of the greenhouses. Later that night, one dog pants loudly, and squelching sounds emanate. The family awakens, and the owner follows the sounds into the greenhouse and sees an incomprehensible scene of the two dogs entwined, with one's head poking out from parts of the other's.

Tim looks through a box of records in a mostly packed-up bedroom, with the sound of a going-away party coming from another room. He finds pictures of him and Millie, his girlfriend. He also finds a picture of him with his parents, who have recently passed. Meanwhile, Millie talks to friends about her new job. Her friends are unsure about her moving with Tim because he's been distant since his parents passed, creating a rift they hope the move to the country will mend. During a speech, Tim and Millie give to their friends at the party, Millie proposes. Tim takes a long time to respond, creating an awkward moment.

After some time adjusting to their new environment, the two take a hike into the surrounding woods. At what looks like a dead end, Tim sees some bells leading into the woods — a path at one point, now overgrown. A sunny day quickly turns to rain, and they get turned around. Tim slips into a hole, grabbing onto the canon of a bell embedded in the side of the rocks. Millie tries to pull him up, but the two slip into the hole. Thirsty and without water, Tim finds a pool of water and drinks from it. 

Lots of weirdo imagery. Great slimy effects and solid CGI that isn't too intrusive, but obviously, I wish they had stuck to practical effects. As other reviewers have said, CGI for body horror is a hard sell.

A central selling point of the movie is Dave Franco and Alison Brie's real-life marriage. You can speculate all you want about the personal life, but what I think it brings to the table is organic, ready-made chemistry that helps sell the waves this relationship takes.

The sound design is excellent, with its creaking bones, tearing flesh, and claustrophobic sounds in the distance. The score frequently rips off <i>Hereditary</i>, but not to an annoying degree.

The film seems to be about how people lose their identities in codependent relationships. Who they are becomes contingent on the other person's proximity. At first, this can feel like love, because our culture makes love out to be a desperate need for one another. But, as Mr. McCabe says, sometimes people mistake peace for complacency. All that said, this movie has nothing healthy to say about relationships.

I wish this movie didn't spend the vast majority of its runtime with Millie and Tim in conflict with one another, because it leaves solving any of their problems until the final act, which already has plenty to resolve.

Still, I enjoyed the movie and am happy something this weird is doing well.
